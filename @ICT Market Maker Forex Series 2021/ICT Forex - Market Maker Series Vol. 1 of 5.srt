00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,640
foreign

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
all right folks welcome back

3
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
for those that don't know this is me

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
doing a

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
revamp of an old 2014

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
video series i did by the same title

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
mark maker series i did 12 videos

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
in that series and i was long-winded in

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,680
most of those

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,680
installments so with the backdrop of

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
all of the supportive studies on this

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
youtube channel

13
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,359
it's been my

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
interest to revisit that series and kind

15
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,640
of like polish it up a little bit

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,840
and with that perspective in mind

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
hopefully i'll be able to deliver

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,240
something that's

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
much more meaningful and impactful to

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
your trading

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
especially for those that have been with

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,479
me for a long time

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,840
uh newer students to have acquired over

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,479
the

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,159
last six months or so may be

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
impressed by the level of

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,759
insight that this series will bring them

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,680
but i also want to begin with something

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
that is important to know

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,960
there's a lot of market maker

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
buzzwords that are making the rounds on

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,560
youtube

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
on instagram all over social media

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,759
facebook

35
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
telegram everywhere and

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
the bulk of what you're seeing

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
regurgitated

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
actually came from this series here

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
or it came from my 1996 lecture nights

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
which

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
again

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
many people have taken pieces

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
of what i've taught over almost the last

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,959
three decades

45
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,239
and tried to come up with their own

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,160
little interpretation

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,760
and all of them have been found wanting

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
it's my goal here to try to

49
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
present this in a manner that is

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
concise succinct and to the point as

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
best as i possibly can and not

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560
try to gloss over too much and make it

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
of no use

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,920
so while i won't have 12 videos

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
i am going to go through that series and

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
pull out everything and put them

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
in the proper context the proper order

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,159
so that way everything that should have

59
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,959
been

60
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
understood and more because this is a

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
revamp of it

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
hopefully will be delivered by me in

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
these five videos

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,840
this first volume is understanding the

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
macro

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
all right before we get into the nuts

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
and bolts of all this

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,159
who is the market maker now obviously

69
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,040
i'm saying that with

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
my tongue and cheek but who is it

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
who is the market maker

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
well the central banks are the producer

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
of currency prices

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,280
and are the market maker

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
central banks establish and manage a

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
country's currency price

77
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
at all times both autonomously and

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
manually

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
currency prices are 100 controlled and

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
manipulated

81
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
by central banks

82
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
investment bank dealers goldman sachs

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,840
ubs city or

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
brokers are not

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
market makers now they're commonly

86
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,600
calling themselves

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
i'm a market maker i'm an ex-market

88
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
maker at goldman sachs i'm an ex-market

89
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
maker at ubs i'm an ex-market maker at

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,800
credit twist all these guys are dealers

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
okay or ladies indifference through the

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
women

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
they're not market makers okay if we're

94
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
talking about

95
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
the currency markets forex the central

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,479
bank

97
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,400
is the market maker everybody deals

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
and trades and exchanges on their

99
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,919
product

100
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
their product is the price of the

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
commodity or currency

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,000
they make that price buyers and sellers

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
do not make that price

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
we only exchange at the price fee that's

105
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
given to us

106
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,400
dealers and brokers do business with the

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,840
price fees set and delivered by central

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
banks

109
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
dealers and or brokers do not set or

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
control currency prices

111
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
central banks are not following retail

112
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
indicators or flawed

113
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,960
retail logic examples being they do not

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
and the algorithms do not consider why

115
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
golf

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
harmonic elliott wave vsa or volume

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
spread analysis

118
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,919
supply and demand zones etc no matter

119
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,280
what it is

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,199
that you may subscribe to as a trader

121
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,479
none of that is considered when the

122
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
central bank algorithms

123
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,440
deliver price reprice or hold in

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
consolidation

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
it's just the facts

126
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,479
central banks employ high-tech

127
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
algorithms to deliver currency price

128
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
fees

129
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,199
and they do not run on supply and demand

130
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,759
i'm going to repeat this one central

131
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,240
banks

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
employ high-tech algorithms to deliver

133
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
currency price feeds

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
and they do not not

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
not okay and let me press it so many

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,680
times

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
it's important you understand this that

138
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,240
supply and demand

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
has no bearing on the delivery of

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,840
currency prices period

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,840
now with all that said let's dive deep

142
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,919
understand the macro now when you're

143
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
considering market maker concepts

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
real market maker concepts you have to

145
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
start with quantitative analysis

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,919
okay a quantitative analysis is

147
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
something that's

148
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
statistical it's measurable it's not

149
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,120
subjective

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,919
it's not left for interpretation like

151
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,960
looking at a trend

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,800
is a trend still bullish or is it

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,080
bearish you ask

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
20 different traders on multiple

155
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,280
different time frames

156
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,479
they're all going to come with with a

157
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,160
different interpretation of whether it's

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
bullish or bearish

159
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
okay that's subjective that's

160
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,560
qualitative

161
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
okay we'll get into qualitative analysis

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
but for now

163
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,199
we have to start with quantitative

164
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
analysis and that means

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
something that is measurable it's

166
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
statistical

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
and it's not up for interpretation it's

168
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
pretty much straightforward

169
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
when you're doing quantitative analysis

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
you're asking essentially the first

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
question being what should the market be

172
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
experiencing at the present

173
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,879
like right now when you're sitting down

174
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
in front of your charts what are you

175
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,879
expecting

176
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000
price to be experiencing in terms of

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
bullish or bearish is the market bullish

178
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,520
or bearish

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
you have to have a way of determining

180
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,639
that

181
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
how do you get that information what

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
derives

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
that answer or whether it's bullish or

184
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
bearish

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
so where do you find that information

186
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
well the first is global interest rates

187
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,720
now this address here is just an

188
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,599
additional link

189
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,120

page that link specifically though you

194
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,320
want to bookmark that one

195
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
okay and whenever you do your

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,719
quantitative analysis you can refer to

197
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,839
the global rates

198
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
and the other being commitment of

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
traders and you can find that

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
on barchart.com now these are just

201
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
suggested

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
websites that if you google and you do

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
some

204
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,959
your own leg work you may find that

205
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,080
there are other

206
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
websites out there that you're more

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
inclined to

208
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
use or warm up to these are just simple

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
generic websites that will provide the

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
information for you

anybody's service

213
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
you don't need to be a part of any

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
specific platform this information is

215
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,519
100 percent free

216
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
it's just a click and research and

217
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,519
that's it

218
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
the global interest rates are the

219
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,519
quote-unquote

220
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,200
fundamental driver that sets the tone

221
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,600
for

222
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,240
long-term macro price movement

223
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,040
the commitment of traders shows you a

224
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
visual representation

225
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,040
of what smart money is doing and how

226
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,080
they're positioned

227
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
periodically now by blending these two

228
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,839
elements it gives you a real

229
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
measurable and quantitative perspective

230
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
on what smart money is doing or

231
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
in this case what market makers are

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
interpreting

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
price on a long-term basis

234
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,399
that's how you start with the question

235
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,959
of what's bullish what's bearish

236
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,560
notice i'm not talking about trend lines

237
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
i'm not talking about moving averages

238
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,839
i'm not looking for any of those types

239
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,079
of things this is what

240
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
interbank traders concern themselves

241
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,839
with this is what they're looking at

242
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
how do you plan your analysis well by

243
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
looking at these two specific

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
points of interest you're going to come

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,720
up with a buy

246
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
program or a cell program very simple

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
now what does that really mean though

248
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
well let's go further

249
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,920
when you go to barchart.com we're going

250
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
to assume that we're going to be pulling

251
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,839
up

252
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,800
a currency and we'll use japanese yen

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
here as an example

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
you're going to see that they have a

255
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
select commodity tab when you click that

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
tab the drop down menu will appear you

257
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
scroll down to currencies and you pick

258
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
the currency that you're

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,160
interested in studying in this case

260
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,279
we're gonna use

261
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,440
japanese yen you click on that

262
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
your browser will take you to this page

263
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
here what you're looking for

264
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
is every one of these particular

265
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
lines aren't necessarily one that you're

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
going to be

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,839
picking the top you're going to be

268
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
looking for the one that has the highest

269
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,640
open interest

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
so it's the line directly underneath

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
this one the top one

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
is cash you can't plot the commitment of

273
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
traders

274
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
data on a cash chart you got to use a

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
futures chart

276
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
so the highest open interest rate now is

277
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,519
the september contract for 2021

278
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
and you can see the open interest is 196

279
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
469 contracts that means that's the open

280
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,399
interest

281
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
or available open interest that's in

282
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,079
that particular

283
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
contract month after september's

284
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
contract expires

285
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
because we're talking about futures here

286
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
it would roll over to december 2021

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
and the open interest would rise from

288
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
958 to whatever the highest open

289
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
interest would be

290
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
before it expires and then once december

291
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,399
2021 expires

292
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
it would roll over to march 2022 where

293
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
it only has six

294
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
in the open interest slot now that would

295
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
only increase

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
considerably after the december contract

297
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
starts the midway point of its life

298
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
cycle

299
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,880
when you have this page here you would

300
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
be clicking obviously on the second one

301
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
which is september 2021

302
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
once that occurs this is the page it

303
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
would take you to

304
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,360
and look at the upper left hand corner

305
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,639
where it says interactive

306
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
chart you would click that link at this

307
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
point here

308
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
and it would give you this chart once

309
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,519
you're on this chart

310
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
you're going to go to the little tab

311
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,880
that says

312
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,079
plus study when you click on that you're

313
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:06,800
going to

314
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
see an option to put in an indicator

315
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,120
okay when i say that

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
i understand that we're not looking at

317
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
something like an rsi or a stochastic or

318
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
a cci

319
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
none of that stuff is useful okay you

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,839
don't need any of that

321
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
but the commitment of traders you're

322
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,800
going to type that out commitment

323
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
traders and by the time you put in

324
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
com it'll offer that as the option

325
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
you just click on it and then once you

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
click on it it'll open up this little

327
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
window

328
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,639
you're going to click on the little

329
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
eyeball next to small specs

330
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
and that'll put a line through it and

331
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,000
then you'll click

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,240
the add button when you do that

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
you'll get the commitment traders graph

334
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,199
applied to your chart it'll post it on

335
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
the bottom of the chart

336
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
you can toggle to the top of the chart

337
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
or leave it at the bottom

338
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
historically it's always been seen

339
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,880
underneath price

340
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
charts but we'll get to that in a minute

341
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
the other link i gave you is

342
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,639
globalhyphenrates.com

343
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,320
and once you go to that website and you

344
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
click on interest rates and

345
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,639
you know the central bank's breakdown or

346
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
summary of current interest rates

347
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,160
page will open up this is basically what

348
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,519
it looks like

349
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
now each one of these columns

350
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
are active in the way that if you click

351
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
on it it'll sort it like a spreadsheet

352
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,959
now if you click on the country or

353
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,600
region it will put it in alphabetical

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,160
order

355
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
if you click on current rate it'll do it

356
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
from high to low or low to high vice

357
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
versa

358
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
or if you want to know which one's

359
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
changing direction

360
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
for going up or going down you can

361
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,959
toggle that and it'll list it

362
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
by that way as well or you can

363
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
do a search on how the rate was

364
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
previously and when the last time that

365
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
rate was changed at the central bank

366
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
level

367
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
for now the only thing i want you to

368
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
focus on is

369
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,560
toggling clicking this

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
and then sorting them by high to low

371
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,600
okay so or low to high doesn't make a

372
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
difference

373
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
but you want it in a

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,560
list that increases or decreases so that

375
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
way you can find things rather

376
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
quickly now there are some countries in

377
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
here that i'm not interested in

378
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
for instance the israeli interest rate

379
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
i'm not interested in trading that i'm

380
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,760
not

381
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
interested in the polish interest rate

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,040
i'm not interested

383
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
in the czech interest rate or the

384
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,399
hungarian interest rate

385
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
what i'm looking for is like the majors

386
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
like the swiss franc

387
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
the japanese yen

388
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
european interest rate from the ecb

389
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,399
bridge pound for great britain

390
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
obviously the fed from united states

391
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
canada's bank rate new zealand's bank

392
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,199
rate

393
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
so it's basically the majors all right

394
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
so

395
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
australia is another one in here it's

396
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the australian dollar

397
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
so you have all the majors in here and

398
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
what their respective

399
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,839
current interest rate is

400
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,759
now when you're looking at the interest

401
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
rates

402
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
you want to toggle them obviously

403
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
however you want to sort them

404
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,079
you want to sort them by specific

405
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,880
country you can click on this and it'll

406
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,320
toggle all the

407
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
countries by alphabetical orders that

408
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
way you can find the

409
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
majors that are coupled with the dollar

410
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,199
or a cross of your choice

411
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
quicker that way and then visually go

412
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
right over to where the interest rate is

413
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
at the moment

414
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,680
now i'm going to talk to you about

415
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,160
interest rate differentials

416
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
what is an interest rate differential

417
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,839
well it's the difference obviously

418
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,560
between

419
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
one country's interest rate versus

420
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
another and why is that important

421
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,079
well the importance is that on a central

422
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
bank level

423
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,360
and an interbank level large flows

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
seek yield and that means that they're

425
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,039
always

426
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
looking for a rate of return

427
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,760
now would you rather be in a country

428
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
that has an interest rate of five

429
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,439
percent

430
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
or would you rather be in a country that

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
has an interest rate of

432
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
two percent in other words you have the

433
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,359
ability to make five percent

434
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,480
or two percent which one would you put

435
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
your money in

436
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,799
well hopefully you would be considering

437
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,240
the five percent

438
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,760
well large flows and large

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
interest and yield and speculation they

440
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
think the same way

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
so how do you get the information on

442
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
which country has the highest yield this

443
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,919
list right here

444
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
and obviously as a foreign exchange

445
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
trader that you're aspiring to be or

446
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
maybe you are you're just not finding

447
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,799
consistency this will give you

448
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,480
the foundation to finding real markets

449
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,960
that are

450
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,840
really engineered to go a particular

451
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
direction

452
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,039
but you have to look for something

453
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,160
specific

454
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
and that's the differential so it's not

455
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
enough to simply look for a

456
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,640
high yielding interest rate country

457
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
you need to find a high interest rate

458
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
yielding countries currency

459
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,760
and couple it with a weak currency

460
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
for example if you look at japan right

461
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,280
here okay the japanese interest rate

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,520
for the central bank of japan its

463
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
interest rate is negative

464
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,240
point one zero

465
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
now in this list if we found a currency

466
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
that has a high

467
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
yielding interest rate relative to that

468
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
negative 0.10

469
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
from japan we'll look at the fed's

470
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
current interest rate at 0.25 percent

471
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
so there's a differential between the

472
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
two

473
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
the higher interest rate is with the fed

474
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
or the american dollar

475
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
versus the japanese yen

476
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,720
meaning the differential is positive

477
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,200
for dollar and negative for yen

478
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
now since we have that fundamental

479
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
backdrop

480
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
on the interest rate front we know now

481
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,440
we can go into

482
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,919
the commitment of traders chart and

483
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
we're looking at the dollar index now

484
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
typically i don't really like to put

485
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
the commitment traders graph on the

486
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,840
dollar index

487
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
and the reason why is because many times

488
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,039
it could look

489
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
like this where it doesn't really give

490
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
you a whole lot of information in this

491
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
format now there's a way to

492
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,480
obviously change this and draw more

493
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
information from it but majority time it

494
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,200
looks like this

495
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
and it won't give you the movement above

496
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,360
the zero basis line now the zero basis

497
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,160
line

498
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
what we're interested in is the red line

499
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
that's the commercials the commercials

500
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,640
we'll just

501
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
call them the central banks okay

502
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
when they go above the zero line that

503
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,520
doesn't necessarily mean

504
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,880
it's a buy and

505
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,600
just because they're below the zero

506
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
basis line

507
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
doesn't mean that the dollar index is

508
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
going to go down

509
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
what we're looking for is a combination

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
of interest rate differential

511
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
and the highest

512
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
long position net long or

513
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,880
lowest net short position held by the

514
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
commercials

515
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
now since we're looking at the dollar

516
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
index and we're thinking in terms of it

517
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
being a

518
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,120
higher interest rate which is

519
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
you know it's really not that high of an

520
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
interest rate it's only a quarter

521
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,960
percent

522
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
but in relationship and contrast to the

523
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
rate of the bank of japan

524
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,760
being negative point one zero

525
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,200
dollar has the better interest rate so

526
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
what we're looking for is a time when

527
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
the dollar has

528
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
the commercials being above the zero

529
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
line

530
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
we see that here in the latter portions

531
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,240
of 2020

532
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,120
in december into january notice that the

533
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,240
red line is higher than it's ever been

534
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,720
in the past few years so they're net

535
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,520
long here

536
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,200
higher than they have been in recent

537
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,520
time at this moment

538
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,919
in the chart now this by itself is

539
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,799
bullish

540
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
only if we see the opposite with the

541
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
japanese yen

542
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
because remember what we're doing is

543
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
we're matching up a strong fundamental

544
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
interest rate differential against

545
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,880
a weak interest rate differential

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
that being dollar versus yen so if we

547
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,880
take a look at the yen

548
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
you can see as we crossing from december

549
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,080
into january 2021

550
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
the commercials have never been this net

551
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,159
short in order they're thinking that

552
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
it's overbought and it's likely to go

553
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
down at this point right there

554
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
so anytime in the past in this chart

555
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,039
they've never been as bearish or below

556
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,320
the zero line

557
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,240
as they were right here and

558
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
by itself it doesn't mean anything you

559
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
want to see a

560
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
break in market structure and if you

561
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
look at this swing low right there

562
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,559
you see a low with a higher load to the

563
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,799
left and a higher load to the right

564
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,080
many of you to understand market

565
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
structure would be looking at this low

566
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,039
being broken and that's the market

567
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,919
structure break

568
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
for you that's not what it is for me

569
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,679
this is a

570
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
swing low the highest of all these

571
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,960
candles

572
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
up here until it finally broke down this

573
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
being broken there is a market structure

574
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,120
shift or break from me

575
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,600
once this occurs then all of the

576
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
understanding of this outline for you

577
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,159
where

578
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
it's bearish for yen bullish

579
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
for dollar and the interest rate

580
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,480
differential will now kick in

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280
then the algorithms will start to

582
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
reprice

583
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,280
yen lower and dollar higher or

584
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
consolidate dollar

585
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
presently we've been seeing dollar

586
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,039
consolidated but yen has been allowed to

587
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
reprice lower

588
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,039
so how's that translate to a 4x chart

589
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,799
well here we have the dollar yen because

590
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,320
when we're pairing the weaker against

591
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,120
the stronger using these differentials

592
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,200
the two currencies are dollar and yen

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,320
so the pair name is dollar yen

594
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,679
and that's what we're employing here for

595
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,840
the charting purposes the chart is

596
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,640
plotted

597
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
on the basis of us dollars versus

598
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,919
japanese yen

599
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
and we're using the stronger fed rate

600
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
versus the weaker

601
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,400
japanese rate so this translates into

602
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
expectations that it would be bullish

603
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
for this chart because dollar should be

604
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,200
going up

605
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,320
while yen drops and it would be

606
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,679
basically bearish yen thus

607
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
dollar yen should be expected to rally

608
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,799
higher

609
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,520
and we obviously see that here here's

610
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,000
december

611
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
crossing into january short term high

612
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
broken so then we have a break in market

613
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
structure now the algorithm will reprice

614
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
dollar higher against yen and that's

615
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,320
what you see here

616
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
now this is not a small move folks this

617
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,080
is pretty significant

618
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
but this in itself is the basis to

619
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
understanding how to find

620
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
markets that should be moving in one

621
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,799
direction

622
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,960
but you're doing it in a way that is

623
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
done like an interbank trader

624
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
it's not some willy-nilly guy that puts

625
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
tdi

626
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,279
indicators on his chart calling all

627
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,880
kinds of moving averages

628
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
and chasing price we're looking for

629
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,159
real measurable and quantitative means

630
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,919
of determining what these markets are

631
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,480
going to do it's not hypothetical

632
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,760
it's not subjective it's

633
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
very specific things that you're looking

634
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
for

635
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,200
and you go in looking for these types of

636
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
moves to be

637
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
the foundation to majority of your

638
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
trades now if you trade in this

639
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
direction

640
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
and you're buying you can be a

641
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
short-term trader being a buyer you can

642
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,520
be a day trader

643
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
you can be a scalper you can be a

644
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
position trader

645
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,240
swing trader every facet of

646
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,559
trading disciplines can be employed by

647
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,919
being bullish on

648
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,840
dollar yen

649
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,840
okay now we're going to be looking at

650
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
the interest rate differential

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,559
in the cad yen this is going to be a

652
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,919
case study for it

653
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,840
so we're going to be looking again at

654
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,039
the japanese yen

655
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,200
which is a weak interest rate negative

656
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
0.10 and the canadian dollar has a

657
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
interest rate the same of what we

658
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
referred to in the dollar index it has

659
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,679
the same rate

660
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,640
so right away you should know that it

661
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
should be bullish canadian dollar

662
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,679
bearish japanese yen but we have to go

663
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,120
behind the scenes and go do a

664
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,159
quantitative

665
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,760
analysis on what the actual positions

666
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
are by the smart money because the

667
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,919
commitment traders gives us a graphic

668
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,799
depiction

669
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,960
of their real trading of their real

670
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
positions

671
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,880
it's not just well this should be

672
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
bullish

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,240
or this should be bearish okay that's

674
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,440
the

675
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
precursor the interest rate differential

676
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
is the precursor

677
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,200
it doesn't mean just because one

678
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,120
interest rate is higher than the other

679
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
that the chart is going to be anytime

680
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
you sit down in front of it

681
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
it's a good buy or a good sell relative

682
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
to that differential

683
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,640
you need to know that that is just the

684
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
fundamental backdrop or underpinnings in

685
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,880
the marketplace

686
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
then you have to wait for smart money to

687
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
position themselves

688
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
then once that's there the algorithm

689
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
will reprice

690
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
all right we're looking at the canadian

691
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,880
dollar futures market this is the

692
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,200
september 2021 contract

693
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,159
on barchart.com and this is the symbol

694
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,679
you would use to see it

695
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
okay and plotting the commitment of

696
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,679
traders

697
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,200
now if you recall back on the

698
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,600
globalrates.com or globalhyphenrates.com

699
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
website when we were looking at canadian

700
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
dollar you probably didn't

701
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,679
notice it since i didn't mention it i

702
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,039
apologize but if you

703
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,440
go back to that list or rewind the video

704
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
rewatch it or whatever

705
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,480
you'll see that in march of 2020

706
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,919
it showed that it dropped

707
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,159
about half a percent from 0.75

708
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,600
down to 0.25 percent so it's a quarter

709
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,000
percent

710
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
from three quarters of percent so

711
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
the interest rate actually dropped a

712
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,240
half percent

713
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,799
in march of 2020 just from

714
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,919
looking at it from face value some would

715
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,360
say oh that's not good

716
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,840
because the interest rates are dropping

717
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,200
it doesn't make a difference here

718
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,320
because what we're looking at is the

719
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,919
differential

720
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,840
0.25 is still better than negative 0.10

721
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,960
so when we look at march here

722
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,039
this deep dive down in price

723
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,840
it happens around the same time that the

724
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
interest rate announcement comes out

725
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,279
and even though the interest rate

726
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,360
dropped a half a percent

727
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
it's still a positive interest rate

728
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
versus a negative interest rate that's

729
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
seen in japan

730
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,080
so right in here when price is

731
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,960
consolidating look what's occurring here

732
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
we have a big buildup of net long

733
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
positions by the commercials they're

734
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,720
above the zero line so they're bullish

735
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,840
okay so they're bullish at the time

736
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
when the interest rate differential is

737
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,840
positive for canadian negative for yen

738
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,960
later on as we get into the end of 2020

739
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
we move from bullish to negative below

740
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,520
the zero level

741
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,880
this swing down doesn't change it being

742
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,520
bullish

743
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
it just means that we're in a strong

744
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
trend and these relative equal highs up

745
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,240
here

746
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
and some of you that are new to think

747
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
that this isn't equal it's relative

748
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,760
okay it's we'd look for this to be taken

749
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,240
out

750
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,840
okay in other words there's a lot of buy

751
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
stops up there just like this

752
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
is relatively equal highs but it didn't

753
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,559
take long for it to get

754
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,880
above that there but from a long-term

755
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,840
perspective and this

756
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
we're focusing on this high here

757
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,480
should be challenged and we've seen it

758
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
here

759
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,399
now i know some of you may be new to me

760
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,840
and this might seem like well this is

761
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
obvious to talk about it in hindsight

762
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
but i promise you

763
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,919
this stuff repeats all the time every

764
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,640
three months

765
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
every six months every nine months every

766
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
year okay

767
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,679
it works all the time but we're in

768
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,360
a year that followed a really

769
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,480
weird year because of all the illness

770
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,080
related things and i'm not going to say

771
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,679
anything more than that

772
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
but even with that this information

773
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,320
still

774
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,279
fairs out moves so we have a net long

775
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
position here

776
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,279
that's bullish at a time when the

777
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,039
interest rate has dropped

778
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,840
so since 2016 the negative rate on japan

779
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
hasn't been changed so we had a change

780
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,000
in the interest rate on the

781
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
looney or the

782
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,240
canadian dollar so that rate

783
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
dropped a half percent but still

784
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
remained positive

785
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,039
rate in contrast to what japan's rate is

786
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,320
negative 0.10

787
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,880
so we have the real positioning of the

788
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,640
smart money being bullish

789
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,399
at a time after the interest rate

790
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
announcement

791
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,880
and even with this drop down below the

792
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
zero line here

793
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,399
all that indicates is we're in a strong

794
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
trend and now they're just hedging

795
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,039
into until we get to this really extreme

796
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,360
net

797
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,159
short position here where that's where

798
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,159
the market tops out

799
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,760
after it runs this high and it runs the

800
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
end of its seasonal tendency and i will

801
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,960
count you to go back through

802
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
recent videos and again the time of this

803
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,080
recording

804
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,399
is july 26 2021

805
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
so in recent weeks or within a month or

806
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,159
so

807
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,480
i taught a lesson on seasonal tendencies

808
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,799
and actually talk about canadian dollar

809
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,320
and how the seasonal tendency for

810
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
canadian dollar

811
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,960
is specific around

812
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
a time of year and if you look at what

813
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
we see here

814
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,080
it's delivered exactly like i outlined

815
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,440
even in that video there

816
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,039
but that's for another time another

817
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,440
discussion let's move over to

818
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,039
the japanese yen again we've already

819
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,640
seen the chart

820
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,840
but we're referring to it again

821
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
so we're bearish here

822
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
and just crossing over doesn't change it

823
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,799
from being bearish to bullish it just

824
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,440
means that

825
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
the trend is strong and now they're

826
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,519
hedging in

827
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,840
as it's dropping down they're buying

828
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,600
into those lower lows because they sold

829
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,480
short up here

830
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,000
and to get out of the short how you have

831
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,480
to get out of it you have to buy it back

832
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,159
and that's all we're seeing here is the

833
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,159
smart money is buying back their heavy

834
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,640
net short positions from up here so

835
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,679
let's take a look at what that

836
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,960
translates to

837
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,159
in terms of a forex chart so the

838
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,840
interest rate differential on cad

839
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
yen is seen here so in november the

840
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,880
summer time period

841
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
you can see a market structure break

842
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
here it comes back down and starts to

843
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,679
rally up

844
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,159
and follows that underlyingly bullish

845
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,519
canadian dollar

846
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,679
bearish japanese yen and the market

847
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,840
rallies up

848
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
and has a significant price run of over

849
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,039
1200 points

850
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
so that's a significant run in price

851
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
so you can be again in any of this run

852
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
up here you could be a day trader

853
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
you can be a short-term trader you can

854
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
be a swing trader a position trader

855
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,320
but these large moves are what the

856
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
interbank traders

857
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,840
from the central bank level okay there

858
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,039
will be people that say

859
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
central banks don't trade no

860
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
they employ people to trade for them

861
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,480
they speculate

862
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,159
they're trying to make money in every

863
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
avenue okay they have their tentacles in

864
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,600
everything okay so it's not a stretch of

865
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,720
the imagination

866
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
to if they're going to control price and

867
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
they basically run

868
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,200
the whole store

869
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,640
who's going to police them

870
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,679
no bun there's never been an audit on

871
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,280
any central bank

872
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
you're never going to tell them they can

873
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,320
or can't do something

874
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,000
it's their game it's their role it's

875
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,679
their casino and they can do whatever

876
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
they want

877
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,359
and if they control it they have the

878
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,000
inside edge

879
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,280
they have the advantage okay so you can

880
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,839
be mad

881
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,960
you can fold your arms and hiss and

882
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,599
say this is unfair or you can say well

883
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,520
this is how they do it

884
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,000
and i'm going to operate like this this

885
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,520
is the closest that you're going to get

886
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
to it

887
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,239
and it works it's

888
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,879
extremely powerful information the

889
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,399
insight that it gives you

890
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,639
really puts you on the right side of the

891
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,239
marketplace and it's not just

892
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,760
a one-day bias it's

893
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,719
long-term now i don't get in positions

894
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
and hold them

895
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,079
from a low like in november

896
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,040
2020 all the way up to a high of june i

897
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
don't trade that way

898
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
and the reason why is i don't have the

899
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,520
patience

900
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
to do that because i'm like a dog

901
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
chasing cars

902
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
i can see a one-minute chart a

903
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,560
five-minute chart a 15-minute chart a

904
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,880
one-hour chart and see

905
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,160
dozens of trades all week long and if i

906
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,599
have a trade on

907
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,320
like this my personality is short term

908
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,000
specialized in doing in and out surgical

909
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
strikes that because i can change my

910
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
mind a lot

911
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,760
and i'm not saying that's a good thing

912
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,920
i'm just saying i've matched my personal

913
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,599
personality with a mode of trading that

914
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,000
fits

915
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
and suits me which is crucial for your

916
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,119
trading

917
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,320
but don't let that be an invitation for

918
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,119
you to mimic

919
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,400
me because some of you may be excellent

920
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,560
long-term position traders that you're

921
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
very committed to an idea and it takes a

922
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,839
lot for you to change your mind that's

923
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,640
the personality

924
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
characteristic that's meant for

925
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,079
long-term position training

926
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,839
but if you don't have those

927
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,280
characteristics and you're trying to do

928
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,240
it

929
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,520
it's like it's very miserable because

930
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,240
you're gonna feel like you can't you

931
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,040
can't do it

932
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,400
okay you're gonna be wanting to change

933
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,839
your mind all the time every little

934
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,880
fluctuation is gonna make you wanna

935
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
change your mind to get out of the trade

936
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
and a swing trader has a little bit

937
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,520
less patience than a position trader

938
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
but more patients than a short-term

939
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,920
trader day trader or scalper

940
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,599
and some of you have those

941
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,920
characteristics and

942
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,079
others are thinking well you know i like

943
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,040
to be in for

944
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
a week maybe three or four days and then

945
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
get out that's short-term trader

946
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,240
if you have less patience than that

947
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,920
you're probably a day trader at heart

948
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,520
and the way you would use this

949
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,160
information

950
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,800
is from the crossover here when we had a

951
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,079
market structure break

952
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,000
and it starts to rally again every

953
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
bullish day in here is a day where

954
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,000
you're trying to capture

955
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,040
intraday price moves a day trade

956
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,720
and down days may be a day that you take

957
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
a loss or you sit on your hands and wait

958
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
for a new setup

959
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
and scalping you would

960
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,599
put more on your trades that were in the

961
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,200
bullish side of things

962
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,320
and trade a whole lot less leverage when

963
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,200
you're shorting

964
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,480
in a move that's fundamentally

965
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,880
driven like this i'm not saying you

966
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,560
can't make money shorting in moves

967
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,400
that run up like this but my question is

968
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
why would you want to do that

969
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
when everything is predisposed to go

970
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
higher

971
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
okay so hopefully this first installment

972
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
has got your gears turning

973
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
and it gives you a little bit of clarity

974
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,040
about

975
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,800
the mystery that makes these markets

976
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
move around

977
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
we're going to dive a little bit deeper

978
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
into what makes these things

979
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
gyrate and go to where they want to

980
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
eventually get to

981
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,000
in volume 2 until then be safe
