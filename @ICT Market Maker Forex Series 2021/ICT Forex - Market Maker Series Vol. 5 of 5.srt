1
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,719
all right folks

2
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
this is part five in the final

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,559
installment for the inner circle trader

4
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,079
market maker series for the youtube

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,399
channel

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
i'll be teaching on daily bias and

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,320
generic

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,440
market macros

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,640
all right so we've been teaching on the

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
british pound versus us dollar in this

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,520
series

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
it's relevant to the time of this

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,559
recording

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
those of you are watching it as i'm

15
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,600
producing it

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,879
or looking at your charts you'll be able

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
to see all these things as well but

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,680
those that

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
don't have that benefit you can't go

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,280
back and look at five-minute charts

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
because some

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
platforms don't let you do that this

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,920
will

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
help fill in that little gap of

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
education plus i'll amplify some things

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
on the lower time frames

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,840
we're looking at monday july 26 2021

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
on a five-minute chart opening price at

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
midnight

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
price me entering around trading down

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
into london

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
taking out a short-term low as soon as

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
that happens you want to see

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
does it show along someone a rally it

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
does

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,439
then retraces back down again it takes

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
out a short term low

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
again that would be an area where you

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
could be a buyer

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
rallies above now it takes out the

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
initial high of the day

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
during an open kill zone this right here

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,439
is where retail traders like to buy that

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
and they have to suffer through all this

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
retracement

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,318
you want to be buying below the opening

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
price or wait for a run

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
above and then come back down into

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
your open price now we have optimal

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,080
trade entry

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
there price shows displacement to the

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
upside

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
creates relative equal highs before

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
new york open kill zone 7 a.m near

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,239
global time

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
market drops back down below a short

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
term low

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
optimal transfer from this low to high

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
ot is right there you can pull that up

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
on your own fit

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
price runs the relative equal highs

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
trades into

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
one enclosed time period noon shuts the

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
door

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,200
high the days warrant

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,640
all right tuesday of the same week

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
remember all of this is framed on the

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,720
bullish

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
weekly expectation to run into that

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
bicep equity pool

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
so the week's bullish we already looked

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
at monday now here's tuesday

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,120
opening price here we want to see it

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
trade down first because this is judah's

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
swing the judah swing catches traders

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,239
off guard

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
and they generally aren't looking at

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
this as a buying opportunity they're

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
thinking it's going to keep going down

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
it goes down into the heart of london

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,720
open

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
so the low forming below a short term

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
low here

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,400
rallies short-term break there so now we

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
have optimal trade entry

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
with a break-in market structure in a

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
bullish

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,280
week and on tuesday

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
price starts to rally up trades right

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
back to the opening price

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
sells off once more rallies again and

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,840
hostile trade entry rallies aggressively

93
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,120
through

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
the initial highs of the day again

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
one enclosed time period between 10

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
o'clock in the morning and noon

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
new york time creates the opposite end

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,799
of the daily range

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
it goes a little bit higher later in the

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
afternoon

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
but not by much try not to get so

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
obsessed about getting the absolute

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
highest high

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
and if you can capture a portion of this

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
move here

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
who cares if you get out the actual high

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
here or here

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
if you caught either the new york or the

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
london

110
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,639
that's just a phenomenal trade no matter

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
how you slice it that's

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what you're looking for but this is how

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
we're operating

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,080
on an intraday basis inside a bullish

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
market environment

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,880
in a market that's shown a willingness

117
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
to be bullish because of smt

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
the low sell side liquidity pool in the

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
daily chart it's

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
wanting to go higher is clearly reaching

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,360
for some

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
measure of buy stops and we've outlined

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
that on the weekly chart

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
and we're going to continuously look for

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
buying opportunities until we get up to

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,840
those buy stops

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,039
on wednesday july 28

128
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,680
2021 this is fomc wednesday

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
so we're seeing price back and forth

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
every short-term high takes out a

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
previous short-term high

132
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
short-term low takes out a short-term

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
low

134
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
high above this low gets taken out here

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
let me trade back up to here so it's

136
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
going back and forth not letting any

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,759
position stay safe and then we go into

138
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,280
the dive in new york

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,600
rallies up and then closes the end of

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
the day with one enclosed

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,080
but fomc is two o'clock in the afternoon

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,720
so

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
we see it trade down again taking out

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
the short term low

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,600
and then it rallies this is seek destroy

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
okay seek destroy is a market profile

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,880
where it's

148
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
literally taking out short-term highs

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,319
and lows all day long

150
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,759
then finally at two o'clock in the

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
afternoon when the manipulation enters

152
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
the marketplace

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,199
it takes out the low of the day why

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,400
because i taught you

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
before a market has a directional move

156
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
that's strong in nature

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
that's really animated bullish or

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,479
bearish if we're bullish

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
anticipate a low being taken and

160
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,199
you see what's happening here you run

161
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
down the algorithm

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
cleans that low out then it goes higher

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
and you've seen me do

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
the entry right in here and you watched

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
me take a trade

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,759
and recorded it with tradingview with

167
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
that idea after it took the blowout that

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,639
felt confident

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
trading it and attacking that by bicycle

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
at 139.10

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,759
on thursday 29th of july 2021

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
price had already started rallying in

173
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,479
the afternoon of the previous day

174
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
after fmc announcement and we had a

175
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,639
little bit of a

176
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
drop down on thursday but we're not

177
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
going to reference the opening price on

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
thursday because we're so

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
late in the week we're focusing

180
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
primarily on buying below the opening

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
price in bullish

182
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
weeks on monday tuesday and wednesday

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
bearish weeks we're looking to sell

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
short on monday tuesday and wednesday

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
above the opening price on thursdays and

186
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
fridays we're not

187
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,919
factoring that in

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
london we have a price run here and

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
trades back down into optimal trade

190
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
entry

191
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
rise again consolidates a little bit and

192
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
in new york

193
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
we come very close to the high of the

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
day but london closed creates the high

195
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,759
of the day

196
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
again when blood closes 10 o'clock in

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,280
the morning to noon

198
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,039
new york time and we fall off

199
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,199
going into noon on thursday

200
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,879
which brings us to the day this

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,360
recording friday

202
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
july 30th 2021

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,080
this level here is thursday's daily high

204
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,919
okay

205
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
so we have relative equal highs here and

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
then previous days high

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
we've been in a week that every day has

208
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
gone higher

209
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
we've already been well above our

210
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
objective which is this level here

211
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,039
for bicyclity framed on that weekly

212
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
chart

213
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,159
london we trade down

214
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
notice that we are just a little ahead

215
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,719
of the beginning at two o'clock in the

216
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,599
morning

217
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
trades will low there retraces back down

218
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
again here

219
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
rallies sweeps thursday's high

220
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
now we have pressed every single day

221
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,360
higher

222
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,000
now we're on the last day of the week

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,959
the algorithm

224
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
will likely trade back into the weekly

225
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
range

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,279
when can we trust that well we've swept

227
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,000
thursday's

228
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
daily high go back here's the low

229
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
prior to that run so we have this low

230
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
and the highest high of the week market

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
breaks down below that low

232
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
right there then trades right back up

233
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
into the last up close candle why is

234
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
this a bearish order block

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
because we've taken out previous days

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,120
high

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
we've worked the whole weekly range

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
bullish every single day

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
and expectations will be there will be a

240
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
retracement back in the daily range

241
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,080
there's less likelihood of

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
continuation on the upside this late in

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
the week after it's gone so far above

244
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,959
our objective which was down here so

245
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,680
here

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
we have a market structure break there

247
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
rally back up into bearish order block

248
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
which is another optimal trade entry

249
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
new york session we see it break lower

250
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
again

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,560
a strong break in new york there

252
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,800
optimal trade entry high low retracement

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
we have a low here and we have a low

254
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
here relative equal lows

255
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,800
it breaks down and attacks that old high

256
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
and returns back to that area

257
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
to consolidate so

258
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
all in all we've watched how the

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,959
algorithm

260
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,880
will seek liquidity take that liquidity

261
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
once that liquidity has been taken it

262
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
will look for opposing liquidity

263
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
we saw how the daily chart on pound

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,640
dollar

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
traded lower to take out its relative

266
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
equal lows

267
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,279
and below that was sell stops so now if

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,240
they went down

269
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
to take those sell stops and accumulate

270
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,399
them as longs for smart money

271
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,640
where does smart money unload

272
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
above this line here that 139.10 which

273
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,600
was the weekly

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
buy stop liquidity pool and we traded

275
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
80 plus pips above the 139

276
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
big figure

277
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
cleaned out thursday's high high of the

278
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
day forming

279
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
and then we break down and all of this

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,760
here

281
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
is classic this also

282
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
if you look at the consolidation here

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
this is original consolidation

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,040
accumulation reaccumulation smart money

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,760
reversal

286
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
where's the smartline reversal occurring

287
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,680
above thursday's high which is the high

288
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,640
of the week

289
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,040
then we break down took out that low

290
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,079
this becomes a low risk cell

291
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,200
distribution redistribution below the

292
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
emission consolidation

293
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
boom marketing sum level where's the

294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,399
trade to

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
the old objective we had all week as a

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,800
buy side liquidity pool everything fits

297
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
together folks

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
it may not feel like it right now i may

299
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
feel disjointed because

300
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,120
you're just now starting to get serious

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
about learning this

302
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
all these moving parts have their place

303
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
in the grand scheme of things in the

304
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
great machine

305
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
that is the algorithm all these little

306
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
pieces and components

307
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
fit together and once you understand it

308
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
it gives you clarity that is unrivaled

309
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
so hopefully you found everything in

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920

other supportive lessons that's already

dig into them really take notes it

317
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
covers a lot of things on how to study

318
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
what you should be studying what things

319
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
you should be avoiding

320
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
times and days that look for specific

321
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,360
things

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
i touched on a lot of that in this

323
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
series and

324
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
literally if you just followed this

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,639

326
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,200
carve out income

327
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
now am i saying you're gonna get rich no

328
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,959
i can't say that

329
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,120
can you make an income off of this

330
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
absolutely i believe you can

331
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,959
in fact i have students all around the

332
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,959
world that did not even join my

333
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,320
mentorship they've never seen a

334
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,360
mentorship video

335
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
they have no idea what i'm teaching in

336
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,839
there they've only studied this

337
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,040
content on the youtube channel they are

338
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
independently making their own money

339
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
without any

340
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,079
insight from me no hand-holding i'm not

341
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,200
telling them what to do

342
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
they're doing it all on their own and

343
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
nothing can make me more proud than that

344
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
the fact that i've given you my time

345
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
i've shared my life's work with you all

346
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
and you've

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
had the opportunity to test it for free

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,120
all you have to do is go into these

349
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
videos and test it and see if what i was

350
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,079
saying was

351
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,760
true was it really in the charts like i

352
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
said and those diligent individuals all

353
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
around the globe

354
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
that put that challenge to the test

355
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
they discovered that this is in fact

356
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,320
really what goes on

357
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,639
and some of them have went on to get

358
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,639
funded

359
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,760
and now they're trading with the amount

360
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
of money that i would have never been

361
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
able to save

362
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,800
up to do and they're getting checks

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
they're getting

364
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,199
payouts they're getting inspiration

365
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,560
every day because of the things that

366
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,000
they're doing all by themselves

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
has nothing to do with me i don't want

368
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
that credit

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
you're taking that risk you pursued your

370
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,720
passion

371
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,279
you believed in yourself learning this

372
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,000
and i should

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
never be credited for your

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
success there that success

375
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,360

until next time good luck and good

381
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,079
trading

382
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,240
you can use all this information also to

383
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,199
get in sync

384
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,800
with what i teach in this youtube

385
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
channel which is a one shot one kill

386
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,800
this is the wednesday fomc day

387
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
and you can see this candle here i went

388
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,959
long

389
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
the fill was 138.65 and

390
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
two pipettes so as we dropped down

391
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
we swept this low and then we went back

392
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,399
down into it again

393
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,000
i trusted the fact that we didn't want

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
to go back below that low and i went

395
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,920
along there

396
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
rallied higher i took a partial there

397
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,399
and i took a partial there you see this

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
in the recording on my telegram channel

399
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
and then i also left 500 000 leverage

400
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
on the trade with a limit order at

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
139.50

402
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,399
it's like a partial there 250 000 came

403
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,600
off and the final 250

404
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,839
came off on a limit basis at 139 51 and

405
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,880
one fit that

406
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,399
there so this is a typical

407
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
one shot one kill where i'm aiming for

408
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
anywhere between 50 to 75 pips a week

409
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,560
and that's it if i went and traded

410
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,959
earlier in the week on tuesday

411
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
this would have been enough by itself

412
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
but i did something on tuesday

413
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
with pound with my mentorship and you

414
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,079
all saw this one here

415
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
using everything that i've outlined here

416
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
from beginning to end

417
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,160
everything i used was literally

418
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
youtube level it's not secret you know

419
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
mentorship stuff

420
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,959
everything here is taught somewhere in

421
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,880
my youtube channel

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
now i get a lot of emails

423
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,440
and it takes forever for me to get

424
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,399
through them and it's

425
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
gotten to the point where i'm probably

426
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
never gonna get caught up anytime soon

427
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
there's just so many of them coming in

428
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,120
but i can tell you that if you have the

429
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
question in mind that

430
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
where is a certain thing taught i don't

431
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,399
know

432
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
specifically what videos because i've

433
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
done so many videos

434
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,160
i just i didn't keep a good record of

435
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,079
what i did in each video

436
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
um years ago some of my students were

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
doing a really good job of

438
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
documenting what's covered in what video

439
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
and even what minute marker

440
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
it would be i don't know what that is

441
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,360
and

442
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
maybe when you're doing your studies

443
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,199
through this channel

444
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
when you study your videos each time you

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,439
come to a specific thing

446
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,359
you might want to break down the video

447
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
and kind of like do it as chapters like

448
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,439
a

449
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,000
between minute mark or this and this ict

450
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
talked about this or that topic or order

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,720
blocks or you know breakers or

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,919
mitigation blocks

453
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
you know all those types of things it'll

454
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,839
make it easier for you to go back in

455
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,960
and locate those areas to to touch up on

456
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
a subject matter that may be a sticking

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
point or a struggling point for you

458
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
obviously there's a whole lot more to

459
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
trading and i could have took a lot more

460
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,679
out of

461
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,240
the free content here and made much more

462
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,840
out of this series

463
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,039
but i literally watched the market maker

464
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
series this week

465
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
all over again and

466
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,240
i had a lot of talking in those videos

467
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,880
and while

468
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
most of its useful information i want to

469
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,720
kind of give you

470
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,840
a rendition that was more to the point

471
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
that goes right to the heart of what all

472
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,039
these videos

473
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,520
should have given you an understanding

474
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
and then

475
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,679
what should have been taken away and

476
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,919
this isn't everything like i could have

477
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,679
put even more

478
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,840
into this but i wanted to give you

479
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,799
something that is

480
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
useful that i used in real world

481
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,919
settings

482
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,160
where in front of lots of people

483
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
okay all around the world they watched

484
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,480
me co-sign this whole idea this week

485
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
and it panned out and it delivered like

486
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
gangbusters

487
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
it's not a fluke i could have talked

488
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
about this and it could have flopped

489
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
but because it's rooted in the things

490
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
i'm teaching you here which is also

491
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,840
taught

492
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,799
in other areas of this youtube channel

493
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
it's not created just because

494
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
this stuff worked this week okay it's

495
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,679
literally every single week every single

496
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,799
week

497
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,200
these markets operate with these

498
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,559
specific generic

499
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,799
macros a macro is a small little program

500
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,320
that unfolds in an algorithm

501
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,039
and what they are is basically a price

502
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,000
run

503
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
from one level to the next during a

504
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
specific time of day okay that's the

505
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
easiest one i can give you as an example

506
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
another would be when it's bullish a

507
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,039
bullish optimal trade entry that forms

508
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,320
between seven o'clock in the morning at

509
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
10 o'clock in the morning new york time

510
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
and runs to 10 30 in the morning

511
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,039
okay that repeats a lot

512
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,160
several times a week but i'm teaching

513
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
you as my students

514
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
to focus on the highest probable day of

515
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,799
the week

516
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
in the most probable direction bullish

517
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,919
or bearish

518
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,280
and the time of those specific days

519
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
and what those patterns of entry look

520
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
like

521
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,039
there's other things once you've gone

522
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,320
through this

523
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
series a couple times taking copious

524
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,760
notes

525
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
you want to go back into lessons where i

526
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,799
talk about money management

527
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
i have psychology lessons in here trade

528
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,559
psychology

529
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,840
i have lessons on how to deal with

530
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,240
drawdown

531
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,280
because you're going to have it no

532
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
matter how good you think you are you're

533
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,159
going to have drawdown

534
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,760
and how you're going to manage that how

535
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,200
you're going to overcome that

536
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,480
how you're going to mitigate those

537
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,200
losing streaks i teach that for free in

538
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,159
this youtube channel

539
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,760
i am convinced that everything i've

540
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,240
given

541
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,799
for free in this youtube channel

542
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
literally lays waste to everything out

543
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
there you can buy as a course

544
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,840
and that's barring no mentor none

545
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,320
whatsoever

546
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
because it's free you can test drive it

547
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,520
here you can

548
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
see right away if there's any fluff

549
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
there's a lot of talking

550
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
but the talking points are important

551
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,320
because i'm actually addressing

552
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
psychological

553
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
factors that's going to either arise

554
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
from the things that i'm telling you to

555
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,679
do in the video

556
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,159
or from a previous video that i got

557
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
feedback from

558
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
when i do a video but back then when i

559
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
was doing those videos i was able to

560
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,080
read my emails a little bit more

561
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,679
quickly and keep up with it now i just

562
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,840
you know with over 120 000 students and

563
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
i have a youtube channel

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
audience too i i personally

565
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
cannot keep up with the correspondence i

566
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,440
wish i could

567
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
because i love it sometimes it moves me

568
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,880
to tears because of the joy

569
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,000
i get by hearing these stories and

570
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
also the stories that people are

571
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,520
struggling not every one of my students

572
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
do exceedingly well

573
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
i want to be up and up front and honest

574
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
and tell you that i've said it in the

575
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
past it's not like something i want to

576
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
just confess to now i've always said

577
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,159
this

578
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,120
this is a very difficult business to do

579
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,760
well in

580
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,280
because you're competing against

581
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
yourself

582
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,960
you're misinformed you're giving

583
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
so much improper information

584
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,120
and there's so many people out there

585
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
masquerading as someone that knows what

586
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
they're doing

587
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
and all of that is a disadvantage for

588
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
you

589
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
and it's almost like a land mine field

590
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
laying in front of you

591
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
and you really need to know where to

592
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
step because if you step

593
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,799
the wrong place at the wrong time it's

594
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,679
over

595
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
and if you do it enough times no matter

596
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,840
how strong you feel about

597
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
conquering this and knowing that there's

598
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,120
going to be periods of

599
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,880
adversity at some point

600
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
even the best of you will want to throw

601
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
into town quick

602
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,200
i'm here to tell you don't

603
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
don't ever quit it doesn't cost you

604
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
anything to watch these videos except

605
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
for the time that you invest

606
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
if you keep digging into them and keep

607
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
practicing when i tell you to practice

608
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,039
and keep studying and looking for the

609
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,120
things i'm pointing to

610
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,240
it will happen for you it will unlock

611
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,360
your understanding

612
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
and one day what day i don't know it is

613
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
always different for somebody else

614
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,039
and i have students from my 2016 group

615
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,919
that still

616
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,760
cannot make money i'm being absolutely

617
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
honest

618
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
but i also have students that just came

619
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,400
into this final group in 2021

620
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
that are literally killing it because

621
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
they were trading

622
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
with information they learned here with

623
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,000
those hit and miss hit and miss

624
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
now they're doing exceedingly well was

625
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
it because they joined the mentorship

626
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
probably or is it because they put

627
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,080
enough

628
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
time in beyond what they probably

629
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
thought was going to be required

630
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,480
i think it's that so

631
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
don't give up don't let someone else

632
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
convince you that you're wasting your

633
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,440
time doing this

634
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
the worst thing you can do is tell your

635
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,919
friends and your family what you're

636
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,960
doing

637
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
don't even do that because they're not

638
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
going to understand

639
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,159
and they're going to be asking you

640
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
usually at the wrong times hey how you

641
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
doing you're so-and-so and it'll be a

642
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
period where you're struggling

643
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,799
and they'll be like well i'm glad i

644
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,720
didn't listen to you

645
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
how's that going to make you feel it's

646
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
going to make you question whether or

647
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
not what you're doing

648
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,640
is a viable means of pursuit to a better

649
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,200
life

650
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,039
when i'm telling you it absolutely is

651
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
this is the last bastion folks

652
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,039
look around i'm not going to describe

653
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,919
what i'm

654
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
really hinting at but all you have to do

655
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
is look around

656
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,559
every form of employment

657
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,400
is being ravaged right now

658
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
it's going to get worse do you have a

659
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,159
hedge against that

660
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
do you have a way for you to feed you

661
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,760
and your family without having to leave

662
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
your house

663
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,720
or hold your hand out for a government

664
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
handout

665
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
no subsidies required no leaving your

666
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
home

667
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,840
as long as you have an internet

668
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,880
connection

669
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,240
and equity in the account you can eat

670
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,200
that's where we're at now it's not about

671
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
getting rich

672
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,039
it's about making sure that you can eat

673
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,120
that you can meet your bills make your

674
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,679
ends meet

675
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
so it's my prayer and heart felt desire

676
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
and passion to

677
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
to inspire you to do well and hopefully

678
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
i've given you some tools here too

679
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
to do that or at least begin the journey

680
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,080
and working towards it

681
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
you're always in my prayers i'm always

682
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,840
thinking about all of you

683
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
even i don't know you i've never laid my

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
eyes on you face to face never shook

685
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,559
any of your hands

686
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
i'm rooting for you

687
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,520
and you'll get it just keep plugging

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,000
until next time be safe
