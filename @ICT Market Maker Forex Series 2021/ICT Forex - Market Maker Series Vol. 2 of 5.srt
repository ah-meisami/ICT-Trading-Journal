00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,039
foreign

2
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,719
all right folks welcome back this is

3
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
volume two of the continuing series of

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
five parts for the ict

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
market maker series this installment

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
will be focusing primarily on

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
foundations to institutional order flow

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
and understanding liquidity

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
alright so when we're considering what

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,399
the

11
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
large institutions are doing and how to

12
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,399
operate and engage in

13
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
the foreign exchange market the premise

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
i want to begin my trading with

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
and my analysis with on the weekend is

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
what i think the weekly charts going to

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,880
do

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,159
and that's what we're showing here is a

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
weekly chart of the british pound versus

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
us dollar

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
every candle in this chart represents

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,799
the highest and lowest

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,920
price for an individual weekly range

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
and i sit down on my weekly chart and

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
look for areas that are

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
obvious okay what i mean by obvious

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,520
years ago i taught that if you find a

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
level that's too clean

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
okay and it's just too straight edge

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
chances are it's probably going to get

31
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
swept

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
what do i mean by that well if you look

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,960
at this

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
area right here

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
notice how this candle goes to that low

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
the body stops here the body stops here

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,119
it doesn't really have any kind of

38
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,000
jagged end or bottom to it

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,960
just real smooth and clean just like

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
this high

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
and this high has a relatively clean

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,640
level up there and these two candles

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
here have a really nice clean

44
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,720
level to it and these right here

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,000
pretty much the same thing but

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
my eye jumps to these levels the

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
significance about these levels

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
is that below this level here

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,599
is sell stops traders that went along

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,800
here

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
they had stop loss orders to protect

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
that long in the form of cell stops

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
so this level in here

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
is saturated with willing participants

55
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,000
that want to sell

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
at the market because their belief is if

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
it goes below this

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
level here they're probably wrong in

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
their long

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,599
idea and they want to get out before it

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,040
causes them to lose more money

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
conversely there are traders that will

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
see this level as support and if it

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
breaks

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
their idea is well support's broken so

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
it's probably bearish and they want to

67
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,400
go short

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
so how do you go short you sell so

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
the function of the liquidity that rests

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
below these

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
smooth or clean equal lows

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
is cell side in nature so it's

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
sell stops or sell side liquidity

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
the market last week at the time of this

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,799
recording it is

76
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
july 27 2021

77
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,680
and the market trades down last week

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
and sweeps below these clean

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,159
candles okay so this area here

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
gets attacked and notice it comes off

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,519
that

82
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,799
low and closes here on the week

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
the week at present of this recording

84
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
we opened here has small little movement

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,799
below the opening of

86
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
the week and then we had this movement

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,319
higher

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
now prior to this candle closing

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
up here we didn't really know

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,439
if it's going to go down there and

91
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,239
continue

92
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
going lower or if it's going to reverse

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
that's not necessary

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,959
to find profitability and consistent

95
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,320
setups all we're looking for

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,440
is runs on liquidity okay so

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
you have to know where the draw on

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
liquidity is and that's what i'm showing

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
you here this is what you're looking for

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
areas that are too clean that may

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,479
draw price up into them or down into

102
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,160
them

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
so just the opposite of what we saw down

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
here

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
what would be resting above these

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,639
relative equal highs

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,840
buy stops anyone that was short how well

108
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,880
trader

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
protect his bearish position with a buy

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
stop

111
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
so any movement above here that would

112
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,120
trigger buy stops on shorts and or

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
some traders that see this as resistance

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
if it breaks that they would see it as

115
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,680
what

116
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
resistance broke and therefore bullish

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
so this is the closest draw on liquidity

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
that's opposing

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
this so when we started the week here

120
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
we opened traded down just a little bit

121
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
and started the trade higher

122
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
where is it likely to go right above

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,479
these highs

124
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
doesn't mean it will absolutely do it

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
but this is what we do

126
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
we look for areas where the draw on

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
liquidity acts like a magnet

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
okay imagine how this

129
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
candle is gravitating towards this level

130
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,280
here

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
to attack and absorb the liquidity

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
which rests in the form of buy stops

133
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
which is opposite of what we saw down

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
here

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
so the buy stops here are the near-term

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
draw on liquidity so

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,440
institutional order flow for the week

138
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
should be bullish until we get up into

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
this area

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
at that moment we have to reassess

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,639
everything continuation if it's

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
likely or reversal if it's likely or

143
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
just consolidation

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
but we don't need to know that right now

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,919
that

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
starts the week here with the likelihood

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,919
of running up into this area

148
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,720
so the inability for a price to make a

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
significant price run lower is the tip

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,960
off that we're going to see

151
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
institutional overflow or bias

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
or trend or momentum to the upside until

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
we get into this area right here

154
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
for the purpose of attacking this buy

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,120
side

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
liquidity pool for the buy stops

157
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,240
so if you zoom in here i want you to

158
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
think about the weekly range

159
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
in the context that the open

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,840
and decline from the opening price

161
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,759
anywhere in this area close to the

162
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
opening price

163
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,479
or below it is ideal for going

164
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
long this is the cheapest it's likely to

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
get

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,199
and the closest you can buy around that

167
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
opening price

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
the better as we get closer and closer

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,039
to this area up here

170
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,800
the idea of probability or low risk

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
starts to dissipate because we have the

172
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
likelihood that this could retrace back

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,560
in

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
this range now the time this recording

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,759
it's only

176
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
tuesday evening in my local time on the

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,800
east coast of

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,039
the united states but

179
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
it could very easily continue and trade

180
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
well beyond

181
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
these levels here into wednesday and

182
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,680
thursday

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,400
maybe even friday i don't need to know

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,360
that

185
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
the premise starts with we're down here

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
we came off the low after taking stops

187
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
it's probably going to make a run for

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
this area up here for liquidity

189
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
so the ideal scenario is if i'm thinking

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
that that means the weekly range

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
is likely to be bullish or at least i'm

192
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
outlining it as that so for my

193
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,080
qualitative analysis

194
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
this is what i'm doing remember in the

195
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
first volume we did quantitative

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
analysis where there were

197
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
measures that were data oriented

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
this is a little bit more subjective so

199
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
that's why it's qualitative

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
and the idea is if i'm bullish for the

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
week

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,759
i'm expecting monday and tuesday and

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,520
early parts of wednesday

204
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
to be bullish until we get to an area

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
where the draw on liquidity

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
is reached

207
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
we're going to drop down to a daily

208
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
chart here you can see

209
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
monday's trading this is the candle for

210
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,640
the entire range of trading on monday

211
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,159
july 26 2021

212
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,640
and then tuesday's trading daily range

213
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,920
for july 27

214
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
2021 and notice how monday we had a nice

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
little

216
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
rally higher and on tuesday we opened

217
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
here

218
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
and then we traded down into this candle

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
right there

220
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,760
this candle is what i teach as a bullish

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
order block

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
the market's already bullish or the

223
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,120
underlying narrative

224
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
is bullish and we had a confirmation to

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
market wants to go higher

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
on monday it trades higher on tuesday we

227
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,360
trade

228
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,279
down into that level the opening price

229
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
hits it trades off of that

230
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
rallies back through and makes a higher

231
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
high

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
than that of on monday remember the

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
candle opens here

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,720
and then trades down this is a judas

235
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,760
swing

236
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
retail traders get caught up in that on

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,399
a lower time frame they think it's

238
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,160
bearish and they start selling short

239
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,279
and then when it hits a higher time

240
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,839
frame level like this that's key

241
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
or significant it'll reverse and start

242
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,839
to trade higher and it catches them off

243
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,240
guard

244
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
some of you have probably noticed that i

245
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
posted a trade

246
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
or result of a trade that i did today in

247
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,839
british pound

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
versus us dollar this very market

249
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
i'm showing you the framework in context

250
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
because i knew i was teaching this today

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,360
in the second volume of this teaching

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,839
series so i'm teaching you

253
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
on the level of my youtube content and

254
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
everyone's familiar with my

255
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
concept of the order block through this

256
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,040
youtube channel

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
using the bias that

258
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
suggests that this is likely to reach up

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,600
into

260
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
these buy stops

261
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
so anticipating its continuation into

262
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
wednesday

263
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
to attack this now does it need to do it

264
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
no because i've already been profitable

265
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
on the entry and management of tuesday's

266
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
trading

267
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
dropping down to an hourly chart that

268
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
blue line

269
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
i used on the daily chart to identify

270
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
the bullish order block level

271
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
is now green here okay so i don't want

272
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
to trip you up i just want to have a

273
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
contrast because of the time frame this

274
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
level is that same

275
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
bullish order block level on the daily

276
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
just transposed to the hourly chart

277
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
notice how the hourly chart trades down

278
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
hits it and rebounds

279
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
and starts to trade higher this is that

280
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
area where the buy stops are this level

281
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,680
and higher

282
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
is where those buy stops reside

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,440
so it's drawing price up there

284
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
zooming in here you can see again this

285
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,480
is the

286
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
daily bullish order block level and i

287
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
want you to look closer

288
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,959
think about what i was showing you on

289
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,519
the weekly chart there's clean levels

290
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,120
well there's singular candle lows and

291
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
highs

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
or swing point highs and swing point

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
lows or swing lows and swing highs

294
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
depending on how you want to say it they

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
have stops

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
of and below those as well

297
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
this candle right here is a case in

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
point

299
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
we have a swing low a single candle that

300
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,399
has a higher

301
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,399
low to the right and a higher low to the

302
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,959
left one single candle there that swing

303
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,760
low

304
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
is going to be seen as a short term

305
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,399
swing low where sell stops are sitting

306
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,839
right below that

307
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
because the markets rallied up it

308
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
consolidated rallied again

309
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
and when it's up in here all in this

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
consolidation those that bought down

311
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
here or even over here

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
they have their stop loss trail right

313
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
below that low

314
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
and the market drops down to take those

315
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
participants out

316
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,839
and then rallies why is it going down

317
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,279
there to accumulate

318
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
sell stops why are they attacking the

319
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
sales dots because this is attacking

320
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
participants that are willing to sell at

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,160
a lower price

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,000
lower than what when it was up here

323
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
institutional traders will not buy up

324
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
here they're going to wait for it to

325
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
drop down

326
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
to attack a very deep discounted price

327
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
and pool of liquidity of sellers that

328
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
want to sell at a cheap

329
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
price because they trade their stop loss

330
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
up there

331
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
so these sell stops flood the market

332
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
with sell orders

333
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
and smart money buys them at the market

334
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
so it goes right in here and buys them

335
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
so this is called pairing of orders the

336
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,920
market hits this

337
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,600
and then price rallies

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,959
now this is that same swing low zoomed

339
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,320
in

340
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
but i'm drawing your attention to these

341
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,440
consecutive down closed candles because

342
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
this is a bullish order block

343
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
the high to the opening price now why

344
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
not the entire range

345
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
like a supply and demand zone would be

346
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
well this is not supply and demand

347
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
so it's the high down to the opening

348
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
price

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
extend it out in time and the market

350
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
drops down into that that's a bullish

351
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
order block

352
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,399
and it's taking out cell stops

353
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
so a high probability order block is

354
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
when it takes out stops and returns down

355
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,839
to

356
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
the order block itself not every down

357
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
closed candle is a bull shoulder block

358
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,440
and not

359
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
every up close candle is a bare shoulder

360
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,680
block but if you are in a context

361
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,560
that is bullish as i've outlined here

362
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
and clearly proven i was trading

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
with this bias today

364
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
the underlying pinnings of the market is

365
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,839
it's bullish

366
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,560
so therefore down close candles to have

367
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,519
a market move away from it

368
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
and has a swing low just above it like

369
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
we do here

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
that's a confluence of specific things

371
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,519
that make it high probability for the

372
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,560
other block

373
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
the order block is the consecutive down

374
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
closed candles

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,199
all three of them make up the order

376
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
block but the sensitive price point is

377
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,240
the high

378
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
and the opening so you can be a buyer at

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,920
this high

380
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,680
or at the opening price the easiest one

381
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
is using the high and allowing your

382
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,399
stock to absorb

383
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,199
any adverse price movement against you

384
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,959
that would if it was going to go back

385
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,440
into

386
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
say the opening price you have to

387
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,560
consider

388
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
that when you're placing your stop so

389
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
how how does that affect your trade well

390
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
when you're starting out without

391
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,480
lowering any

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,160
time frame beyond the 15 time frame here

393
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
you can be buying at the high and use

394
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,279
the

395
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
low of all the consecutive down closed

396
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
candles your stop loss needs to be just

397
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,399
below that

398
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
now you may look at this and say oh no

399
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
that's too much of a stop well

400
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
that's all relative in the beginning

401
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
it's good for you to try to trade like

402
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,120
that

403
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
because you don't want to be trying to

404
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
be too precise because many times

405
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
the market will slice and dice you if

406
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,480
you're trying to be too finicky about

407
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,759
your

408
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,920
entries and your stops it can be very

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
easy for the marketplace to take your

410
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
two pip stop loss three pip stop loss

411
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
it can do it okay because the broker has

412
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
the

413
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,480
right and freedom to do that and

414
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
they will i'm not saying you can't use a

415
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,399
very small ultra

416
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
tight stop loss but doing it as

417
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,160
consistently

418
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
over and over and over again uh the

419
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
broker will just widen the spread and

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,399
take you out

421
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
and there's nothing you can do about it

422
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
so

423
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
to repeat a bullish order block that's

424
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,759
high probability is when the market's

425
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
already predisposed to go higher

426
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,720
it's shown a willingness to go higher

427
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
and leave this area here

428
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,759
and we have a short term low so it has

429
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,519
stops

430
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
in a bullish market and it trades down

431
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
below that level here and into

432
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,160
consecutive down closed candles so you

433
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,680
would be buying at the high

434
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
plus the spread and your stop will be

435
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,959
below this

436
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
low right there and that would be your

437
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,279
underlying

438
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,320
risk does the market stay there very

439
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
long once it trades into it no

440
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
leaves it consolidates rallies again

441
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
comes back down into another order block

442
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
here trades lower

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,759
accumulates and rallies again trades one

444
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
more time retracement and then blasts

445
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
off

446
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,199
and attacks all the buy stops that were

447
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,720
resting above these

448
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,600
clean highs

449
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
notice also before the market starts to

450
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,319
rally

451
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,439
it generally takes out some short-term

452
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
swing low

453
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,280
this low took out this swing low

454
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,200
this low took out this swing low

455
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,559
this low took out this swing low

456
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
each time there's a dynamic rally higher

457
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
this swing low was taken out by this

458
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
swing low and it rallies higher

459
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
this swing low is taken out by that

460
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
swing low not by much but it's all it

461
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
takes

462
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,799
and then it starts to move higher so

463
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,799
when there's a run on liquidity

464
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
that's opposed to the underlying

465
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
direction in other words

466
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
if we're bullish on a market like this

467
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
get comfortable with the market reaching

468
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,000
underneath lows and stop

469
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
thinking that it's going to be breaking

470
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,919
down entirely or reversing

471
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,440
most of the time you're going to find

472
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
that it's taking those cell stops out

473
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,360
and absorbing them to offer smart money

474
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
buying opportunities at deep discount

475
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,760
prices

476
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
finally we're looking at price on monday

477
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,120
and today

478
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
tuesday and i want you to notice how the

479
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,799
market does what

480
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
it creates the low in london which is

481
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
exactly what i teach on my youtube

482
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
channel

483
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
and then a continuation in new york

484
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,039
session

485
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,960
on tuesday it creates the low of the day

486
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,440
and a continuation in new york and it

487
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
rallies up

488
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
it's consolidating in here and where

489
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
does the liquidity reside

490
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
again this blue line is that weekly

491
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
line i drew out that was a clean level

492
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,440
where the buy stops are

493
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
so the market's most likely going to

494
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
draw up into that 139 big figure

495
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,480
139 10 and the institutional level 139

496
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,960
20

497
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
could potentially be traded too as well

498
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
to make sure it really sweeps out

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
all those buy stops now what's the

500
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,600
vested interest for the market to

501
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,679
send price that high because smart money

502
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,720
has bought

503
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
down here they bought down here

504
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
and they bought down here where do they

505
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,679
want to get out

506
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,039
at a high price who's willing to buy it

507
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
from them at a high price the buy stops

508
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
resting just above

509
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
that level here i noted on the weekly

510
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,679
chart

511
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,080
so we covered several things in here

512
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
foundations to institutional order flow

513
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,200
how do we frame that we look for the

514
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840
weekly range we look for clean levels

515
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
very clean levels your eyes need to be

516
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,280
trained to look for them and the easiest

517
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
way to do that is go through back

518
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,080
logging and look at old historical price

519
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,640
moves

520
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,160
and mark them up on your chart that

521
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
historical study will train your eye and

522
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,480
activate your reticular activating

523
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
system

524
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
and that means when you see something

525
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
over and over again it makes you

526
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,559
sensitive to it so that way

527
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
you will start to anticipate it when you

528
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
see familiar patterns in live price

529
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,440
action

530
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
and it makes you better at reading the

531
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
tape reading the tape is to simply

532
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
understand what the market's doing live

533
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,840
or what's about to do next okay so

534
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,200
hopefully you found something

535
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
in this that was helpful and insightful

536
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
and i'll talk to you in the next

537
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,440
installment

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
be safe
