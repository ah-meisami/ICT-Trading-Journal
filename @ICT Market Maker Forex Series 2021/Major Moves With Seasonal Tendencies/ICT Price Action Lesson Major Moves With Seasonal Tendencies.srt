1
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,599
alright folks welcome back

2
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
this is a new year and some

3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
new discussions we're going to talk

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
about major moves with seasonal

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
tendencies now i'm going to talk about

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
specifically

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
commodities in this lecture now it's

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
important to know that

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
if some of you are hardline crypto

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
traders or

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
forex traders there are seasonal

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,399
tendencies

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
in forex there are seasonal tendencies

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,760
in

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
the dollar index there's seasonal

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,199
tendencies in stocks

17
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,640
so try not to read so much

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
into this lesson and think of it as only

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
applying to the markets i'm going to

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,119
refer to

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,360
in its delivery okay so

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
understand a seasonal tendency is a road

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,880
map it's a

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
generalization of what has happened in

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
the past

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,840
and if there is some measure of

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,560
repeating phenomenon okay in other words

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
if

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
we think that the market is going to go

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
up at a particular time of the year

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
to a specific time of the year and we

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,799
measure it over

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,040
the last five years over the last 10

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
years the last 15 years the last 20 and

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640
25 years

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,360
there are services out there and i'll

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,399
turn you on to one

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
in this teaching that i have a lot of

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,799
faith in myself personally

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,759
but it's important to note that and i'm

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,079
not

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,040
saying this is going to be the case

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
every single time you look at the

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
marketplace

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
there are some certain caveats that have

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
to be considered

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
and i'll briefly discuss those as we go

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
along but i'm going to try to keep this

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,598
video short

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,878
because i know some of you have very

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
short attention spans when it comes to

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,760
my lectures because

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
i think i'm talking too much but i'm

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
just trying to give you an extra value

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
and insights that you would otherwise

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
have to pay for elsewhere

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
so let's take a look at a

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
dollar index chart to begin with

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
all right so we're looking at the dollar

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,400
index and i'm using tradingview.com

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
all right so you can find this

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,239
information yourself you can go pull up

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,200
your own version

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
of this chart and take a look at the

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
things i'm referring to here

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
and it should be on par with what i'm

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
showing

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
in my charts now i'm going to refrain

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,319
from showing any kind of real

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,840
annotations until we get to the very

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,120
specific market

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
i want to talk about but i'm going to

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
talk about a few of them

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
and review some of the

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
potential opportunities that make their

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,560
sales

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
available each year in these markets

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
so i've always begin my

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
analysis with the dollar index okay and

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
the reason why i do that

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
is because i want to know if we are on a

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,400
risk on or risk off environment now risk

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,440
on

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
would be where the market has the dollar

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
index going lower

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
as we see here around july of 2020 to

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
present

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
and that would allow or permit the

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
likelihood of markets to rally or go

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,200
higher and that being like

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
foreign currency against the dollar and

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,959
also

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
commodities because if the dollar is

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
going lower that is more or less

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
inflationary

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
for commodity prices so they're going to

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
see a an appreciation in

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
the cost of producing and or purchasing

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
commodities so if we can just simply

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
understand that going forward everything

101
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,560
in this teaching

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
will be very easy to follow along if

103
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
you're someone that's new to my channel

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
or new to commodities or trading in

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
general

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
you're probably going to want to watch

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
other video series on this

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,839
youtube channel and it'll help fill in

109
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
some of the gaps i'm certain that you

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,360
have watching this if

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,560
the dollar index is going higher that's

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,479
going to be deflationary for

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
commodity prices and also for foreign

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,680
currencies

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
they're going to go lower in

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
relationship to the higher prices in

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
dollar

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
now if we have that risk on risk off

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,919
scenario

120
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
in mind when dollar is going lower

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
that's risk on

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
when dollars going higher that's risk

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
off

124
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
if we have this period of time

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,919
when the market is clearly indicating

126
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,000
that the dollar wants to go lower

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,039
that means we are on the watch for

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,240
big moves on the upside okay really big

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
moves

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,520
one such big move this year was the

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,000
soybean

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
market and i've been very vocal about

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
that my students know about that

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,160
and i've also tipped the community off

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
in my youtube channel and if you look at

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,919
that over here

137
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
i have a bunch of things that i've

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
shared publicly here now when i look at

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
this

140
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,039
i can see that it doesn't really give me

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
a specific date and i'm actually

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
learning something as i do this video

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
with you right now

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,520
i'm going to include the actual date

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,120
that i posted okay so i wish it would

146
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
have given me a specific date but

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
nonetheless it is what it is

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,680
the uh the thumbs up that's highlighted

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,400
here

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
just so you guys know i like to post the

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,840
comment

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
and then i wait for the first thumbs up

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,759
and i'm usually the second thumbs up

154
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
because it's my way of checking to make

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
sure that it's

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
viewable on your end because i've had

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
members in the past say i can't see my

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,919
post or you know the posts i make to the

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
community tab they don't

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,800
they're saying they didn't see it or

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
they did say they couldn't see it so i

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
usually wait for someone to do a thumbs

163
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:14,960
up

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
that means it's visible on urine as the

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
audience and then i'm typically the

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
second thumbs up

167
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
so it's not me being conceited or loving

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
myself it's just

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,240
a way for me to know that okay that post

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,880
has been seen

171
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
it's public now and i can leave youtube

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,400
and go about my

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
business somewhere else but

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,080
if you look at about a month ago i

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
mentioned

176
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
that if you take a look at the grain

177
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
reports soybeans as i stated since june

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,639
of 2020

179
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,240
was poised to continue to rally into

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
2021 and i state here

181
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919
corn will be next now notice there's no

182
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
edit here like you see here there's an

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,919
edit

184
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
it means i want to not change a typo or

185
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
something like that

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,759
here i'm telling you specifically a

187
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,440
month ago that corn

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
is going to be the next big rally okay

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
it's going to go up

190
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,840
why well if you look at here i'm telling

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
you that china's buying everything it

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,319
can

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
and i give you the reasons i'm not going

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
to read it you can see it here

195
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,160
but i also talked about bitcoin and i

196
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
called 20 000

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
before christmas and when i was on

198
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
twitter which i'm not now i also posted

199
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
in july of

200
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
2020 i stated that i felt that

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
we would see bitcoin 30 000

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,599
by the end of the year going into 2021 i

203
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,680
was off by one day

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
so sorry the

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
next level i called for bitcoin and i'll

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
let you scroll so you can find this on

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,560
your own

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
i called forty thousand and went to like

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
forty two thousand something

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
and then it has recently uh had some

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,400
difficulties

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
so i'm making calls here

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,599
publicly because i've had people in the

214
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
past

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
make some derogatory comments about how

216
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
i don't really put my neck out on the

217
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
line say this is what i think is going

218
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
to happen

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,360
and i used to do that a lot on twitter

220
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
but i don't have twitter anymore so this

221
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,319
has replaced my twitter

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,960
and you can follow along and see what

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,360
i'm

224
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
suggesting in my expectation i don't do

225
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,879
everything

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
but i toss out once in a while something

227
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
for you guys to

228
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
study and we're going to take a look at

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
the corn market

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
here in relationship to the soybean

231
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,479
market

232
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,720
and we're going to use that dollar

233
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
bearishness from july as a

234
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,599
context to anticipating higher prices on

235
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,120
every market i'm going to cover in this

236
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
teaching so let's move on over to

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
soybeans first all right so here's the

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
soybean market and

239
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,560
in june of this past year

240
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
i was warming all my students up to the

241
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,839
idea that we were going to

242
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
eventually make a run above these highs

243
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
here and that we would have a

244
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
pretty big bull market going into the

245
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
commodity market because of the dollar

246
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
index being bearish

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
now some of you that are in my

248
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
mentorship are getting really nervous

249
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
right now because you're thinking i'm

250
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,360
teaching mentorship

251
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
when all i'm doing is talking about what

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
you've experienced before it happened

253
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
so please don't send me emails okay i

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,839
know some of you are highly protective

255
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
and i love you all for that

256
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
but i want to kind of teach something

257
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,800
broad brush

258
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
and i'm really not doing harm

259
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
to what you are participating in so just

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
give me the liberty here to be able to

261
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
be a teacher

262
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
outside of mentorship too because it's

263
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
why this channel exists

264
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
the there is no mentorship joining now

265
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,560
by the way

266
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
so we have closed the doors do not send

267
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,240
me emails

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
and it is what it is this is not a sales

269
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
pitch it's not meant for you hey come in

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
and join learn how to do this

271
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
everyone that's already emailed me if

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
you've emailed me and we haven't got to

273
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,080
yet

274
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
that's fine we'll get to you and we'll

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
consider you but anyone new

276
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
we're not taking anybody else in so it's

277
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
too many people it is what it is

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
and we're done but

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,839
if you look at what has transpired since

280
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,440
june of last year we've had this

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
extremely

282
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,640
handsome price run on soybeans

283
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
so if you were to use the

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
we'll say eight dollars and 80 cents a

285
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,839
bushel

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,680
okay right in here you're not getting

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
the best entry here not getting the best

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
entry here

289
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
but from 880 up to 1080 that's 10 000

290
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,800
per contract okay that's twenty thousand

291
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
dollars if it goes to twelve eighty

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
and if it goes to fourteen eighty

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
that's another ten thousand dollars

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,760
how many bitcoin moves

295
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
have you seen in your lifetime as a

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
crypto trader

297
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
the one we just recently seen and the

298
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
big run up in 2017 right

299
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,560
i called 2017 and i called the top then

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,279
i mentioned many times that you know new

301
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,079
traders that

302
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,360
got exposed to crypto feels like that's

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,880
the only market

304
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
that uh traders could have gotten

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
wealthy on

306
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,920
and i kind of taught this back in 2017

307
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
and in 2018 and 2019 every time i get a

308
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
new student that the first question

309
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
comes to mind is

310
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
you know do you regret missing bitcoin

311
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
because i've been very public and state

312
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,440
that i don't

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
trade crypto i didn't trade bitcoin but

314
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
whenever i make my calls public you know

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
obviously it comes with

316
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,839
a great deal of kickback if

317
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079
if it opposes the view of a certain

318
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,880
group of my

319
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
audience members i don't do this to

320
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
upset anyone purposely

321
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
but you know i get more requests for me

322
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,519
sharing what i think is going to happen

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,360
than people coming back and saying i

324
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,120
really wish you wouldn't have said that

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
so i try to be as open as i possibly can

326
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
and tell you what i think is going to

327
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,160
happen where i think it's going to go

328
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,800
and

329
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
for the most part why i think it's going

330
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,000
to go there

331
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
and every call that i've made publicly

332
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
you're welcome to look at and weigh in

333
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
the balances

334
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,399
but these are big moves that take place

335
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
in the commodity market and you don't

336
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
need a bitcoin move

337
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
to define wealth because

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,560
what you see here can be the same thing

339
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,639
if not more than what you saw in bitcoin

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,440
this past what seven months

341
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
or yeah six or seven months so the same

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
amount of money that one could have made

343
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
in that bitcoin run

344
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
you could do in this right here and i

345
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,959
stated this very market

346
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,680
when i was making the case and argument

347
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
with the crypto traders that were saying

348
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
i should be uh regretting not being a

349
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,079
part of the largest

350
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,959
bull market in history well there's

351
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,320
always a big bull market

352
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
there's always a big mega trade okay

353
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
every year the markets create them

354
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
and i tried to state this before that

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,440
i have tools that help me fare those out

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
and one of the things that i look for is

357
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
a seasonal tendency

358
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
if a seasonal tendency indicates that

359
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
the market's likely to go

360
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,639
up by itself doesn't mean anything

361
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
but if we can find a time when the

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
market is bullish

363
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
and a seasonal tenancy is suggesting

364
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,440
that

365
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,560
historically it usually goes up

366
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
then we have something to work with and

367
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,920
then it's a matter of just waiting for

368
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
market structure to get in sync with

369
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,639
those two

370
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
underlying premise if the market is

371
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,199
bullish

372
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
and the market is showing a bullish

373
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
seasonal tendency

374
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,279
we wait for the market to give us a

375
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
bullish market structure

376
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
so we have multiple things in here and

377
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
i've talked about soybeans before

378
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
so i'm not going to try to redo that

379
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
here and waste time

380
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,920
but we we see markets making runs like

381
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
this a lot in hindsight but it's all

382
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,199
together something different when you're

383
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,560
able to see it

384
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
outline it before it happens and call it

385
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,000
with

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,399
you know a large degree of appreciation

387
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,440
on the upside

388
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
so we're seeing a huge amount of

389
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
potential

390
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
price run that would otherwise

391
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
be either ignored

392
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
or not expected

393
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,480
there's a lot of people on youtube that

394
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
are claiming they got the signals at

395
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:32,959
work

396
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880
they got the the calls that make the

397
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,399
money they got this and they got that

398
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,680
and they're pointing to these tiny

399
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
little itty bitty fluctuations in the

400
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
marketplace

401
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,079
tiny little fluctuations and i outline

402
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
for free give it to you on a silver

403
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,920
platter

404
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,399
30 000 points in bitcoin

405
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
publicly given to you if

406
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
you look at the soybean market i showed

407
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
you that one as well

408
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
and a month ago i tipped you off with

409
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
corn

410
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
so let's take a look at corn

411
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
all right i'm gonna go to corn and

412
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
we'll use the nearby contract which is

413
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,440
march 2021.

414
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
okay so here you go a month ago

415
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
right there okay

416
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,199
corn gonna go higher

417
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
it's gonna be the next big move that's

418
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,120
in the community tab on my youtube

419
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,079
channel

420
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
unedited okay i got

421
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
a lot of flack from people saying that

422
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
i've used

423
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,839
rented servers that i've done fraud

424
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
that i cheat people i lie to people

425
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
i give them a false impression that i

426
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
can trade and

427
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
nobody's ever seen me call markets

428
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
before it happens and it's just

429
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,759
that still finds its way in discussions

430
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
in certain corners on the internet

431
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
and i have been giving you million

432
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
dollar maker

433
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,399
moves okay i'm giving you the big moves

434
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,480
because i can and i'm sharing them

435
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
publicly i'm not selling them i'm not

436
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,199
making you

437
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,240
come into my mentorship to get them

438
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,040
i'm giving you for free because i can

439
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
afford to do that

440
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
i don't need to have people pay me for

441
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
signals

442
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
i'm interested in teaching you how to

443
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,759
find these things

444
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
and honestly everything on this youtube

445
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,519
channel

446
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
shows you how to find these moves but

447
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,759
you don't want to listen

448
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
to the discussions and the lecture

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,839
points that are boring

450
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
and it's one thing to see people

451
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,079
go out and take my content and just give

452
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,560
me some

453
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,399
latitude here i gotta make this point

454
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,839
there's a lot of people out here taking

455
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
my stuff and making youtube videos about

456
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
it because

457
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
times are tough right now and they want

458
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,519
to try to get a group

459
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
get over a thousand subscribers since

460
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,079
they start making some ad revenue

461
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,519
because they need a hustle because

462
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
either they lost their job or they're

463
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
paranoid because everything is going on

464
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
this year or in past year rather

465
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
and they need to make money i understand

466
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
that okay

467
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
but when you are trying to teach

468
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
something that you don't know

469
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,919
you're doing more harm to the audience

470
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,760
and

471
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,559
if you think you know what i can do and

472
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
what i teach

473
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
then you should be able to pull out

474
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,919
these market moves before they happen to

475
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
not talk about them in hindsight that's

476
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,919
the difference between me

477
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
everybody says oh ict's a scalper he's

478
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
an intraday trader

479
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,720
he's mr 10 pips 20 pips no but i can do

480
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
more with that type of trading than

481
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
anybody else

482
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,520
that's trading these larger big position

483
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
trade swings

484
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,919
because i can parlay that up and have

485
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
velocity behind the equity

486
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,160
but you don't need to trade a lot if you

487
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
listen to what i teach

488
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
you can sit back and be very passive in

489
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,799
investment

490
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
and capture these big moves we're going

491
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
to assume that you were in here

492
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,240
around that 4.20 cents a bushel

493
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
and went above today 5.20

494
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
a bushel that is a five thousand dollar

495
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
price move per contract

496
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,840
now it took a month to get it

497
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,919
but if you would have had say i don't

498
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,960
know

499
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
ten call options you wouldn't had the

500
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
full

501
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,039
exposure required for margin

502
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,360
to do the trade you could have done some

503
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
call options

504
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
and whatever you paid for the option

505
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
that would be the amount of risk

506
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
total plus commission that you would

507
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
have looked at

508
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,799
as incurred risk

509
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,039
five grand for a month some of you

510
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,559
probably don't make that in a month

511
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
i know when i was working as a younger

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,600
man

513
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,160
i wasn't making that much money you know

514
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,280
we're talking about

515
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,480
back in the 80s but uh

516
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
1980s it's it sounds funny to say it

517
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,480
like that

518
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,559
and i'm laughing because i think about

519
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,679
how my son was

520
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,960
asking me earlier before i made this

521
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,120
video he asked me to take his dad

522
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,840
um what cool cars were there back in the

523
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
1900s

524
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
and he did to hear him say it that way

525
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,200
made it sound like i'm even older than i

526
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,320
really am

527
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,799
but the the idea of

528
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,160
looking for these types of price moves

529
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,559
and seeing how much is available

530
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,840
on one position okay if you can find

531
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,679
trades like this

532
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,080
and it can present moves like this or

533
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
like what i showed in the soybean market

534
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
those types of moves if you can find

535
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,039
them and fair them out

536
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,080
over time they can make

537
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,160
you wealthy now the problem is this

538
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
like it was for me when i first started

539
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
in 1992

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
i read a book ken roberts

541
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,159
his commodity course and you all

542
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,840
probably heard us enough i'm not gonna

543
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,559
you know beat it up you know even more

544
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,600
but

545
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
i felt that i was going to be one of

546
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
those success stories

547
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
and i was going to make a fortune in my

548
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
first year

549
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,000
and i was going to do everything in the

550
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
book that said and in my first trade i

551
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
lost 50

552
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,039
of the account i've made no bones about

553
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
it it is what it is

554
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
and even my students that first come to

555
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,440
my youtube channel

556
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,480
or they traded other markets and they've

557
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
tasted pain and loss because they don't

558
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,280
really know what they're doing

559
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,360
then they see what i do in these videos

560
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,559
and

561
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,640
it opens their eyes to what they did not

562
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
know and they can go into

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
old data and say wow i can really see

564
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
this is making perfect sense

565
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,919
that's the difference between

566
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,919
understanding what the markets really do

567
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,760
versus what the markets did and let's

568
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,039
write a book about it

569
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
you know it doesn't work it doesn't help

570
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,240
okay

571
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,480
if all these books were able to help

572
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
people make money

573
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,679
then they wouldn't need to make more

574
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,480
books the the people that made books 100

575
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,760
years ago

576
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
would have been enough there would be no

577
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,799
reason to make another book

578
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
so it's this trap that you all follow

579
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
and i did it too

580
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
trust me i did it i wasted a fortune on

581
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
buying books and courses when i first

582
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,799
started

583
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,240
and honestly none of that crap worked

584
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
none of it it caused me to lose more and

585
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
feel even more insecure about myself

586
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
and it it was like an endless circle of

587
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
always learning but never coming to the

588
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
truth

589
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,240
when i got exposed to how the markets

590
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,960
really

591
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
book it changed everything

592
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,240
and i went back in and turned everything

593
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
else upside down

594
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
and it started working

595
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
these ideas here i'm just going to make

596
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,440
it very easy for you

597
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
if you go to amazon

598
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,200
and you buy the book how many million

599
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
dollar trading commodities last year by

600
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
larry williams

601
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
okay let's go over to amazon and i'll

602
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,039
show you what that

603
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
looks like all right so here's the book

604
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
i'm talking about and you've heard me

605
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
mention this before

606
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
so this is where you can go and get it

607
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,159
notice that i'm not giving you a link

608
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,159
i'm not doing an affiliate program i'm

609
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
not trying to get paid for you making a

610
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,720
purchase

611
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
i'm just freely giving you the

612
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,159
information if you don't want to buy the

613
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:22,880
book

614
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,760
then don't buy the book but this book

615
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
was one of the first

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
books that i bought that made sense

617
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,320
and made me money so

618
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
the things i like about this book and

619
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,280
let's see if it can pull it up

620
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,400
here table contents this chapter here

621
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,360
chapter four

622
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
where he says my million dollar

623
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
fundamental system

624
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,559
and going into

625
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
this area here he basically covers

626
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
all of the most important things

627
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,640
that make commodity markets move on a

628
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
large scale

629
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,960
okay so all of these things here chapter

630
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,000
four

631
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
that to me is

632
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
the real shining chapter in it

633
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
doesn't mean that there's other parts in

634
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,840
this book that isn't interesting or

635
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
noteworthy but there are things like he

636
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
talks about the

637
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
phases of the moon and the influence of

638
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
buying and selling on that i don't

639
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,080
subscribe to any of that

640
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,919
but i'm not here to beat him up because

641
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,280
he was my first mentor

642
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
so i'm not trying to say that ken

643
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
roberts wasn't a mentor because he was a

644
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
mentor because

645
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,280
you know that was the very first book i

646
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
read but it lost money

647
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
everything i did with it was completely

648
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
i abandoned everything i learned from

649
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,919
him

650
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
and the next mentor i had was larry

651
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,200
williams

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,240
and this book was highly influential now

653
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
if you go through this book

654
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
you will see the effects and the

655
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,279
impression that larry

656
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,159
had on me and you can also see

657
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
i amped up especially if you're in uh

658
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,480
the mentorship level stuff um

659
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,679
and again i hate to say it that way

660
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,880
because it sounds like i'm dang i don't

661
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,679
want anyone

662
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,120
asking to join because i'm not taking

663
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
anyone new i have to keep putting that

664
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
in there i'm sorry

665
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,600
but if the students that

666
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,679
like who we were all in a big room okay

667
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,279
we were all like at a

668
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,840
a live seminar and i said okay who's

669
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
here that's in mentorship

670
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,159
raise your hand and you'd see whatever

671
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,440
you know number of people would be there

672
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,320
to raise their hand

673
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
and i'd say okay who has gone through

674
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
this book i'm talking about here

675
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
and they would raise their hand and then

676
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
i'd say okay now raise your hand

677
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
if you've seen me amplify and fill in a

678
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
lot of the things for precision

679
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,880
based rules with this information

680
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
because this was the foundation i

681
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
started with

682
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,919
i started with this and i built on it

683
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
and i built on it and built on it and

684
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
it just further solidifies the

685
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,640
importance of having a solid foundation

686
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
if you're going into this with like

687
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
elliott wave

688
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
okay or harmonic patterns

689
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,279
you that is a

690
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,559
niche it's a gimmick

691
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,400
it's a stylized

692
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,320
perception it's not objective it's not

693
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,640
it's subjective this chapter four

694
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,679
that is objective okay and then

695
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,120
if you read it you'll you'll know

696
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
exactly what i'm referring to what makes

697
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,679
it objective

698
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,120
it's rooted in real

699
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
market truths that are either present in

700
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
the marketplace or they're not

701
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,400
it's binary whereas if we had a

702
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
collection of people that traded

703
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,640
harmonic

704
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,720
patterns or if we had a collection of

705
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
people that traded elliot wave

706
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
they would have a difference of opinion

707
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,799
i'm certain of it

708
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,520
if we were giving them the same market

709
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
and

710
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,080
that is what highlights the

711
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,960
in my mind the lunacy in following that

712
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
kind of stuff

713
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,159
and don't get me wrong i wasted years

714
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,600
doing both of those things

715
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,640
okay i know about both of them it isn't

716
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,080
like i read a book and

717
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
you know i never dabbled in it i did all

718
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
that stuff i've done point-and-figure

719
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,720
charts

720
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,799
i've done everything i've done

721
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,760
everything out there

722
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,760
for as far as trading goes and honestly

723
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
all of it is flawed because it doesn't

724
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
start on the basis of having

725
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,080
real logic behind it it's based on a

726
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,640
pattern

727
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
by itself they go in looking for

728
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
patterns or wave counts

729
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
versus understanding what it is that

730
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,279
sets the market up for a move higher or

731
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:53,840
lower

732
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
and where it should draw to now

733
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,840
larry doesn't do that but larry gives

734
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,960
you

735
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,919
the three primary rules and tools that

736
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,760
he looks for that sets up these big

737
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,679
million dollar maker

738
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,799
well i shouldn't say a million dollar

739
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
maker but uh fortune makers

740
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,480
okay um what's a fortune to me you know

741
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,320
if it makes

742
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,919
fifty thousand dollars yeah that's a

743
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,240
small fortune you know i don't look at

744
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
for fifty thousand dollars

745
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
the same way i did when i was in 1992

746
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,279
but

747
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,640
you know if i lost fifty thousand

748
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,279
dollars i'd you know i'd want it back

749
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,360
you know it's it's a meaningful amount

750
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
of money to me

751
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
and to most of you listening that's

752
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
probably a significant amount of money

753
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,279
as well

754
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,960
especially if you're a new student and

755
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
or never traded

756
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,559
profitably you would love to have that

757
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,679
type of windfall

758
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,039
victory in trading if you're looking for

759
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,000
a book

760
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
to give you a real solid foundation to

761
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,760
understand

762
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,520
why a market should go up or go down

763
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,000
this chapter right here in this very

764
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
book

765
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,080
i think that you should subscribe

766
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
to what's being shown in that chapter

767
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
i don't get anything for this i don't

768
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
get a kickback

769
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,640
larry doesn't know i'm even doing it and

770
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,279
i mean it i've said this book many times

771
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,360
over the last

772
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,159
10 years or 11 years now talking about

773
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,520
things from

774
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
you know books that were influential or

775
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
books that were

776
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,720
worth your time reading this is a 1970s

777
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
book

778
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,080
1970s i was a child at the time when

779
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,279
this was

780
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,200
published and put in print

781
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,159
and it's still effective today why

782
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,279
because

783
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,320
it's rooted on things that work

784
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,720
and the man made money with it not a

785
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,919
little bit of money he made a million

786
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,200
dollars

787
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
and then he did it again in 1987 for

788
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,399
people that doubted him didn't believe

789
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,039
he

790
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,799
really made money with it and he won the

791
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
world's cup robbins contest

792
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,120
for futures trading in 1987 and still

793
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
holds 11 000

794
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
as the highest percentage gain in that

795
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,720
contest history so

796
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,200
if you take this information and go back

797
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
into

798
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,039
a market like this you'll see

799
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,200
a lot of those things that he's teaching

800
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
exist in this market here

801
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
okay and before we had this big

802
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,440
extrapolated price move here

803
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
i told you in my community tab on my

804
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
youtube channel

805
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
right here a month ago corn will be next

806
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,120
and i'll give you the fundamental

807
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
reasons why okay

808
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
so uh when it comes to fundamental data

809
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,399
i do consider it when it comes to

810
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,840
livestock like feeder cattle live cattle

811
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,240
lean hogs they're all commodity markets

812
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
i look at it

813
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,480
in regards to the grain reports apart

814
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
from that

815
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
i do not consider fundamental data at

816
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,720
all

817
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
but if i'm trading agricultural markets

818
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
which are commodity markets as i just

819
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
mentioned

820
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,880
then i'm going to consider it and other

821
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,960
markets like the food groups like

822
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,240
coffee cocoa and sugar if we go into

823
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,919
if we look at coffee this is kind of

824
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,080
like the the heart of the teaching here

825
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,679
today

826
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,360
if you look at this price fractal it is

827
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,919
something that i have taught many times

828
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
with the medium of 4x

829
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
and i'll give you a minute pause the

830
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,679
video before i put the annotations up

831
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,520
but try to look at what you think you

832
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
see in this price action

833
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,760
and then when you're ready unpause the

834
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
video and you'll see my annotations in

835
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
the discussion going forward

836
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,799
okay we're going to add annotations now

837
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,520
all right so we are looking at coffee

838
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,039
okay and there is a seasonal tendency

839
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,000
for coffee to rally about the second

840
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
week or third week of july

841
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
i want you to consider the likelihood of

842
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
mid-july being a seasonal tendency for

843
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
coffee to go higher

844
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
now think about what i showed you on the

845
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
dollar index

846
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
in july it was going lower it created an

847
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,000
important high and

848
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,039
just fell out of bed went lower

849
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,279
that again sets the stage for markets to

850
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,080
go higher

851
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,559
in the commodity market just like it

852
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,360
does in

853
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,000
forex so from having a macro perspective

854
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,880
and looking at things seasonally

855
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
blending those things together

856
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,320
it gives us framework to find really big

857
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,960
moves

858
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,279
you don't have to be an intraday trader

859
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,960
you don't have to worry about the power

860
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,760
3

861
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
on a daily candle if you don't have time

862
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,039
to do that

863
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
if you don't have the life framework

864
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
that promotes that type of trading

865
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,679
you don't need to do it don't feel like

866
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,559
you have to be

867
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,960
an intraday trader don't feel that you

868
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,799
have to be a short-term trader

869
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,320
if you look at these types of price

870
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
moves and you think well you know i

871
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,799
could be a participant in something like

872
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,919
that that makes sense

873
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,760
i don't want to have to be relying on

874
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,960
making a decision

875
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,799
each day buying and selling buying and

876
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,640
selling because that takes a certain

877
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,519
type of personality that isn't really

878
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,559
everyone's cup of tea now

879
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,960
i started with this type of trading

880
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
swing trade position trading

881
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,039
i started that way and it was like

882
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,320
pulling teeth

883
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,399
i just couldn't endure it i didn't want

884
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,880
to deal with it it was too slow

885
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,519
doesn't mean i can't do it technically

886
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,039
it just means i can't

887
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
submit to it from a personality

888
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
standpoint

889
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,399
but the analysis concepts that i use

890
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,200
this helps me frame every type of trade

891
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,960
that i'm comfortable with which is

892
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
day trading intraday and short term

893
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,000
that's my

894
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
forte that's where i excel and i can

895
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,279
find lots of those types of day trades

896
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,120
short term trades or swing trades

897
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,640
intraday in the

898
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
overall price model that's being shown

899
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,200
here now what am i actually showing here

900
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,159
well if you look at the relative equal

901
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,360
highs over here

902
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
you know this is a buy side liquidity

903
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,399
pool and the market will likely want to

904
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,559
go back to that point we also have a

905
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,519
consolidation

906
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
that leaves the consolidation comes back

907
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,440
up to the consolidation in here

908
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,000
and drops lower and another level of

909
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,960
decline

910
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,080
hits a important level 100 and in

911
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
rallies

912
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,519
it breaks a short term high here so we

913
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,679
have a shift in market structure

914
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
so when the market comes back down into

915
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,519
a bullish order block which is this down

916
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,360
close candle right there

917
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,600
we have an optimal trade entry so we're

918
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,159
using the lowest low to the highest high

919
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,559
projecting that up that gives us two and

920
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,840
a half

921
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,960
standard deviations and above the buy

922
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,000
side liquidity pool

923
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
so that means about one dollar and 34

924
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960
cents per pound

925
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
for coffee as an upside objective back

926
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,559
here

927
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,919
in july mid july when the seasonal

928
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,279
tendency for

929
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,399
coffee is bullish the market rallies up

930
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,279
it touches these relative equal highs

931
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,719
sells off a little bit goes back into a

932
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,918
bullish order block

933
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,918
here and we have another optimal trade

934
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,918
entry that sends it up again

935
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,760
to a target above the buy side liquidity

936
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
pull resting at relative equal highs

937
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
so if you look at the total range i'm

938
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,679
going to take this off here

939
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
if you look at the total range from this

940
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,839
run here to here you can't say that you

941
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,599
would be a buyer here but you can assume

942
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,159
that you're

943
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,239
close to this area here not at this very

944
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,520
low at 101

945
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
which is the best case area for a low

946
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
and the best case area

947
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,280
for an extra high is the 135.65

948
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,839
so inside this range the best case which

949
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,119
is impossible

950
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,520
would be 34.65

951
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,000
handles okay or 375 dollars

952
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
times 34.6 because the point value for

953
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
coffee is 3.75 cents per point and every

954
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,599
handle

955
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
and what's a handle from like for

956
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,599
instance 134

957
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,560
to 135 that's one full handle that would

958
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
be represented by

959
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,880
375 that's

960
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,560
100 points or one handle price move

961
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
in this case the price moved twelve

962
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,000
thousand nine hundred ninety three

963
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
dollars and seventy five cents per

964
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,320
contract

965
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,680
from here to here

966
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,359
all of this is a market maker buy model

967
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,040
with a seasonal tenancy mid july with

968
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,640
the dollar index selling off in july

969
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,040
which we were looking for ourselves as

970
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
my group was

971
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,640
following along and this type of price

972
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,599
move here

973
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,119
is what i teach i teach these types of

974
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,079
moves

975
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,119
i don't say buy here sell there but i

976
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,520
guide you in every year i take my

977
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,359
students back in and say okay

978
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
this is the seasonal tendency this is

979
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
what we were looking for this is what we

980
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
called in dollar index that sets the

981
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,320
tone for all these other markets

982
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,520
i point to the markets to have these

983
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,640
potential extrapolated price moves

984
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
and we've looked at corn there's five

985
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,839
thousand dollars

986
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,000
we looked at soybeans twenty thirty

987
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
thousand dollars there

988
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,359
we have bitcoin thirty 000

989
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,880
points i'm not sure what that would

990
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,359
equate to you in terms of dollars

991
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,040
but these are moves

992
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,920
that are not small they're very

993
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,880
significant

994
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
they're major moves and if your tools

995
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,480
can help you fared out these types of

996
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
price action moves

997
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,839
every single year this is where

998
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,560
the majority of your focus should be but

999
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,520
you will not

1000
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,480
find them if you're just lazily going

1001
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,040
through the charts looking for

1002
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,599
any old pattern for the pattern's sake

1003
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,839
you have to have the logic behind it

1004
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,200
so notice what i've combined here i've

1005
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,359
combined a market maker by model

1006
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,880
which is what i teach even on this

1007
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,240
youtube channel for free

1008
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,520
big round number one dollar per pound

1009
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
for coffee and i'll let you go out to

1010
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
the higher time frame charts you can do

1011
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,680
that on your own

1012
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,920
and see what one dollar mark looks like

1013
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,040
in hindsight

1014
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,920
and so you can see a big support level

1015
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
around there

1016
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,040
and also if you use the

1017
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,520
kc well let's just do it

1018
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,760
kc and then use the front

1019
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,440
current month use this on kc number one

1020
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
exclamation you click on that and you'll

1021
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,920
see that we have

1022
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,880
this down closed candle prior to this

1023
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,599
run up

1024
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,520
there's your order block all it's done

1025
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
was worked off of that

1026
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,040
went right into it here and created your

1027
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,599
optimal trade entry

1028
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,720
and then rallied now you have to use

1029
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,480
the trading month's contract

1030
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
when you're looking at commodities

1031
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
whereas this is just a

1032
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,040
a cumulative chart of

1033
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,160
all of the nearby current front month

1034
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
contracts right now the front contract

1035
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,359
month for

1036
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,079
coffee is march 2021 prior to march 21

1037
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,960
it was december 2020 and prior to that

1038
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
it was september 2020

1039
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
so these contracts expire in the

1040
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,320
commodity market forex you don't have

1041
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
that issue

1042
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,760
okay but in futures or if you're trading

1043
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,800
commodity markets

1044
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
you have to be aware of that so if

1045
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,320
you're looking at over here we don't

1046
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,520
have those

1047
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,320
pretty easy to see relative equal highs

1048
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,200
like we see

1049
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,560
in the march contract

1050
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,240
here see that so

1051
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,079
you have to look at what's available in

1052
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,280
the price action

1053
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,359
but you all know the market make or buy

1054
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,320
model

1055
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,839
you understand the optimal trade entry

1056
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,920
because that's the flagship pattern here

1057
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
in this channel and you understand order

1058
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,040
blocks because i've introduced them

1059
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,880
publicly here

1060
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,160
and we know that a run on relative equal

1061
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,800
highs is the draw on liquidity that's a

1062
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
standard procedure that i've taught very

1063
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,960
publicly here

1064
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
on this channel and it's caught fire and

1065
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,640
everybody's talking about it now

1066
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
that's wonderful i just wish that the

1067
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,920
folks that were doing that

1068
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,160
would just make a reference and say hey

1069
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
look you know i picked this up from

1070
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
ict and you'll get more respect for me

1071
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,440
by doing that

1072
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,800
it doesn't mean go and take everything i

1073
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
have and teach it all over again but i

1074
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
know that this was going to be popular

1075
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,240
when i gave it out

1076
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,400
and it's just unfortunate a lot of

1077
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
people trying to

1078
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
glory hound and take credit for

1079
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,280
something they didn't earn

1080
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
or work for so these are pretty big

1081
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,000
moves

1082
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,119
and every single year we have these

1083
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,240
types of moves

1084
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,599
so you don't need one of these types of

1085
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,440
moves okay

1086
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,000
i mean people waited around for years

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
for this to occur

1088
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,240
in here i called six thousand to twenty

1089
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,000
and then changed gears before twenty

1090
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,359
and said no it's not going to go so at

1091
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,200
nineteen seven i said it's gonna go to

1092
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,079
six thousand and then from when we got

1093
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,119
to six thousand i said it's going to go

1094
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:25,920
to 3 000

1095
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
and i failed to be accurate there it

1096
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,000
went to like 3 400

1097
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
or 32 i can't remember recall exactly

1098
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
where it was but

1099
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,440
the point is is it eventually dropped

1100
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,319
down to um

1101
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,680
something in here i'm not sure exactly

1102
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
what the low was

1103
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,680
yeah 32 something or 31

1104
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,960
and 31 22 in there

1105
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,319
and then we had this little run here in

1106
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:52,720
2019

1107
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
and everybody thought that was going to

1108
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
run above here and i was like no i don't

1109
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
think it's going to happen

1110
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,200
and we tanked here during the pandemic

1111
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,720
and then that extreme set the stage for

1112
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,680
the low and then from that point all the

1113
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,800
way up to where we went to 42 something

1114
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:21,839
where is it at 40.

1115
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,599
42 000 and that was it

1116
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,560
and then we fell out of bed so it

1117
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,280
dropped 10

1118
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,800
000 points in short order

1119
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,920
in here does it want to go lower

1120
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,079
i don't know to me it doesn't have a

1121
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,920
seasonal tendency yet

1122
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,040
so it doesn't fit this discussion but

1123
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
i'm trying to draw a contrast and please

1124
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
don't take this as me kicking

1125
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,599
sand in the face of crypto traders okay

1126
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,800
i'm not doing that i've done it in the

1127
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,680
past

1128
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,839
okay i'm not i'm not trying to say it i

1129
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,760
didn't do that in the past because i did

1130
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,319
but all i'm trying to remind you is that

1131
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,400
big market moves weren't invented by

1132
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,520
crypto

1133
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,480
okay there are fortune making moves

1134
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,119
occurring

1135
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,359
every single year for those individuals

1136
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,720
that know how to find them

1137
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,000
and that's why people like myself

1138
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,040
used to have a lot of fun reading

1139
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,200
people saying that you know everybody

1140
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,040
else that isn't trading crypto

1141
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,520
can't catch big huge windfall price

1142
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,400
moves like

1143
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,839
it created in 2017 2019 and now

1144
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,839
obviously what was seen in 2020 going

1145
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,480
into

1146
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,480
2021 there's a way to find these big

1147
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
moves

1148
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,160
and i gave you the foundation that i

1149
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,520
started with

1150
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
now that's not all that i do i've put a

1151
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,240
lot of structure on top of that

1152
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,359
foundation

1153
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,480
that's unique to me

1154
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,960
it's not white cough okay it's not

1155
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,480
supply and demand it's not all those

1156
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
things that people like to say it is

1157
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,800
because they want to use those those

1158
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
name tags when they're teaching my

1159
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,440
content

1160
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
and you hear them say order block you

1161
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,119
hear them say breaker those are terms

1162
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,079
i invented i invented those terms

1163
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
they're they're coined by me

1164
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,640
so when i hear them and if my students

1165
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,520
hear them

1166
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,599
right away you know you just know that

1167
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,440
this is a derivative of

1168
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,079
what i have been teaching and it's just

1169
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,280
it's offensive

1170
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,599
to see people do that and not give

1171
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,720
credit where it's due

1172
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
because you didn't endure all the

1173
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,920
hardships

1174
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,160
all the pain the loss monetarily family

1175
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,359
friends everything insanity in many

1176
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,400
instances to get this so

1177
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,920
hopefully you can now think about

1178
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
how seasonal tendencies and i gave you

1179
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,040
one in this

1180
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,359
lesson here coffee is one

1181
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,720
that if you go back and look at your

1182
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,079
data now here's what's going to happen

1183
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,920
i'm already going to predict this okay

1184
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
you're going to hear in certain circles

1185
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
if you are part of

1186
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,200
one that has the

1187
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,839
conversation of ict coming up once in a

1188
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,640
while

1189
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,839
they're going to go into the charts and

1190
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,359
they're going to look for times where in

1191
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,880
july mid july

1192
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,800
coffee didn't go up it's going to go

1193
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
down well you got to look at what the

1194
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,480
market's been doing

1195
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,920
ahead of july if it's bullish going into

1196
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
july that's your

1197
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,119
indication that this is a good strong

1198
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,839
seasonal tendency for coffee

1199
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,880
and there are times where

1200
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,000
if you look at coffee

1201
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,760
and some of you're like i ain't never

1202
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,119
trading coffee why is this guy keep

1203
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:35,760
talking about this

1204
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,720
this market if you look at coffee on a

1205
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,319
i'll do a weekly chart okay

1206
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,720
and you can see we've had some spikes

1207
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,599
and such

1208
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,760
okay but you want to study go back as

1209
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,520
far as the data will permit it

1210
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,319
but looking at all this right here is

1211
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,480
this market bullish or bearish

1212
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
it's obviously bearish so are you going

1213
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,520
to be

1214
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,960
likely to anticipate a mid-july

1215
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,599
run higher in coffee in this instance

1216
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,319
here's the thing

1217
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,400
it can happen but it's most likely not

1218
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,599
going to happen

1219
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,000
okay is that very clear for you if the

1220
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,480
market's bullish

1221
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,040
like it's been here then in july

1222
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,800
there you go there's july right there

1223
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,480
it's going to run higher

1224
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,880
boom now if you look at something that's

1225
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,640
bearish

1226
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,240
let's find july and there you go mid

1227
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,880
july

1228
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,640
now we get we have a little bit of a run

1229
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,079
but look how fast it gives up the ghost

1230
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,880
and goes lower

1231
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,480
you see that there's a difference

1232
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,760
between knowing what you're talking

1233
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,119
about and just trying to look for

1234
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,800
something to say it doesn't work

1235
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
that's what trolls do that's what

1236
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
critics do

1237
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,599
here's another area bearish um

1238
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,760
july right here mid-july

1239
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,200
there okay ahead of that is it bullish

1240
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,760
or bearish

1241
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,599
it's been going lower so is the seasonal

1242
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,800
tension likely to send

1243
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,960
coffee higher on that year no and look

1244
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,319
what happened it fell out of bed even

1245
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,440
more

1246
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,960
so if we look at a time when

1247
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,839
we had a break in market structure here

1248
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,240
we have

1249
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,119
mid july right there right

1250
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,480
there it dropped a little bit and then

1251
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,920
dropped again

1252
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,359
so it was a break in market structure

1253
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,160
but has it really made a bullish move

1254
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,280
not yet it's still in transition in here

1255
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,079
same thing we're going to go to a july

1256
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,240
and that's last year and there you go

1257
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,040
so i'll counsel you to go back and look

1258
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,800
at all the times when

1259
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,920
coffee was bullish

1260
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,160
and when it was bearish

1261
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,760
okay here's a nice area where it's been

1262
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,400
bullish right

1263
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,720
july mid july right there

1264
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,200
bam higher

1265
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,359
now we had reached a level up in here

1266
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,560
and i'll let you look at the

1267
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,640
higher time frame charts and study it

1268
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,839
but here's july

1269
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,440
that year and it rallies

1270
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
doesn't take up the high but that's a

1271
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,960
nice rally but then it falls out of bed

1272
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,200
because we hit an important level here

1273
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,880
and i'll let you go back and look at

1274
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,280
what that is historically using a

1275
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
monthly chart

1276
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
and i'm really doing you a disservice by

1277
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,880
trying to go through

1278
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,760
some of them i'm just giving you the

1279
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
argument that some of my critics

1280
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,480
you know the thumbs down crew they like

1281
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,160

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720

1283
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,319
makes me smile

1284
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,800
who can look at videos like this where

1285
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,359
i'm literally giving you

1286
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,599
lottery ticket winning numbers that work

because i want this channel to be bigger

1300
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,200
than it is

1301
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,280

on youtube

1303
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
that are misinforming people with things

1304
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,319
that don't work

1305
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,800
and the trading community could really

1306
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,040
use a breath of fresh air

1307
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,359
and everybody that's came into my

1308
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,880
mentorship that's it there's no more

1309
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,000
sales pitch

1310
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,119
there's no more 20 22 20 nothing like

1311
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,559
i'm done i'm trying to get all the

1312
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,000
mentorship teaching done

1313
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,319
i'm getting all the payment stuff done

1314
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,240
and then i'm going back

1315
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,359
to being who i was before 2016

1316
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,359
in august when i started this mentorship

1317
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,559
doesn't mean i'm not going to continue

1318
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,240
with my mentorship group and give them

1319
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,680
private teachings

1320
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
because i don't want to be focusing on i

1321
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,280
just want to go back to doing it relax

1322
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,119
and have time to do like i'm doing here

1323
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,400
if you couldn't afford

1324
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,040
the mentorship just know that i'm still

1325
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,920
going to present

1326
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,079
lessons here i'm not going to teach the

1327
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,280
same level

1328
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,800
obviously for those that join my

1329
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
mentorship that would be unfair

1330
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,920
and be unreasonable but

1331
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,520
there is a plethora of wisdom

1332
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,359
in these videos and if you've only

1333
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,079
watched them one time

1334
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,319
you didn't get it all you have to go

1335
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,359
through it a few times

1336
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,040
and take notes and then study some

1337
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
charts and then you'll find out that

1338
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,680
you've

1339
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,520
seen something that if you go back and

1340
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,119
listen to the videos again

1341
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,079
it'll mean more to you and it'll feel

1342
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,559
just like a new video was given to you

1343
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,160
and it's the same video i gave you from

1344
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,520
the beginning it's just they're very

1345
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,160
dense

1346
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,160
there's a lot of like this video there's

1347
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,240
a lot of things and nuggets in it

1348
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,599
that if you learn a little bit more with

1349
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,640
practice

1350
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,640
you'll appreciate the things i've said

1351
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,760
that would otherwise have

1352
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,200
been glossed over by you by your

1353
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,119
attention just not being dialed in

1354
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,559
because you don't know the importance of

1355
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,240
the things i'm saying

1356
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,839
but for those individuals that have been

1357
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,440
a commodity trader

1358
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,599
maybe some of you are futures traders

1359
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,800
and you've traded

1360
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,400
commodity markets and maybe you traded

1361
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,480
coffee before and you never were aware

1362
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,760
of something like this

1363
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,440
this is something that you can

1364
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,960
plan and predict months in advance

1365
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,599
so when we get to july if the market's

1366
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,280
been bullish

1367
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
you can anticipate something like this

1368
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,319
unfolding now obviously it doesn't give

1369
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,599
you an entry pattern

1370
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,599
it doesn't give you an exit pattern it

1371
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,280
doesn't give you the stop loss

1372
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,440
but i'm teaching you a foundational idea

1373
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,920
which is important you have to have an

1374
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
understanding of why a market should

1375
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,440
even be doing anything at all

1376
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,960
just because you think you see something

1377
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,280
harmonic or you think you see something

1378
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,760
that's an

1379
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,480
elliott wave based idea or even a supply

1380
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,119
and demand

1381
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,720
idea doesn't mean anything by itself

1382
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,880
just like an order block by itself means

1383
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
absolutely nothing

1384
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,400
you have to have some context and you

1385
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,720
can't get any better as a context

1386
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,480
than having a seasonal impact

1387
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,559
behind a market move that has happened

1388
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,240
historically over and over and over

1389
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,040
again

1390
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,079
and you can see it you can visually see

1391
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,760
it

1392
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,559
and coupling that when it's bullish and

1393
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,400
there's lots of seasonal tendencies

1394
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,920
there's other seasonal tendencies for

1395
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,839
coffee for it to go down

1396
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,520
specific times of the year and it's

1397
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
other times when it's predisposed to go

1398
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,079
up

1399
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,119
to and the same premise you go into it

1400
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,200
looking for what the market was bullish

1401
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,440
or bearish going into that specific

1402
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,400
seasonal tenancy and by blending that

1403
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,079
with market structure

1404
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,400
and are we in a risk on a risk off

1405
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,160
environment that goes back to the dollar

1406
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,760
index

1407
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,000
if you're if you're expecting a buy

1408
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
signal in commodities

1409
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,200
but you don't see a weaker dollar you're

1410
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,480
probably

1411
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,240
looking at a market that isn't going to

1412
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,680
pan out for you

1413
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,599
doesn't mean it's always like that it

1414
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,920
just means that the probability has

1415
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,680
shifted to a very low probability

1416
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,119
in your favor versus

1417
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,200
if you were expecting a move higher in a

1418
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,720
commodity market

1419
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,280
and the dollar index was bearish and you

1420
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,559
can see it going lower

1421
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,559
then you have a risk on scenario because

1422
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,240
dollars going lower

1423
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,520
and that other market that would be in

1424
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,079
a normal perspective it would be an

1425
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,280
inverse

1426
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,839
expectation so dollar lower commodities

1427
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,119
higher

1428
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,520
so there's this relationship of macro

1429
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,040
and i talked a little bit about that and

1430
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,359
i'll

1431
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,880
take you to the post on my community tab

1432
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,680
now this is the post i did

1433
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,839
today and again today is

1434
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,599
january 12 2021 and

1435
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,119
i did a post like this earlier this

1436
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,559
morning

1437
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,920
and i talked about the importance of

1438
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,480
using

1439
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,359
seasonal tendencies and it's the the

1440
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,240
main thing

1441
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,079
i think everyone should try to focus on

1442
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,520
because there are specific times of the

1443
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,800
year

1444
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,440
that you should be focusing on one side

1445
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,119
of the marketplace

1446
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,160
and not the other it doesn't mean that

1447
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,480
you abandon the other side of the

1448
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,440
marketplace

1449
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,079
because what's really interesting and

1450
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,680
i'm going to finalize this video at this

1451
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,280
point

1452
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,160
if there is a time when the market is

1453
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,960
seasonally

1454
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,040
bullish you can look at the seasonal

1455
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,119
tenancy as a way of

1456
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,920
timing the other direction because the

1457
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,640
markets

1458
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,559
find a way to punish those individuals

1459
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,839
that look for these types of patterns

1460
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:44,559
and they don't

1461
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,599
exist and i'll say it like this

1462
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,119
if you're bullish on the market and the

1463
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,720
seasonal tendency is bullish

1464
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,880
and the market structure is bullish then

1465
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,640
you have a high probability buy

1466
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,920
with the dollar being bearish okay

1467
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,200
if you are bearish on

1468
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,079
a market and the market structure is

1469
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,200
bearish

1470
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,960
and the dollar index is bullish

1471
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,319
then you have high probability in your

1472
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,319
favor

1473
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,200
if you see a bullish seasonal tendency

1474
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,559
and we'll use coffee as a

1475
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,599
example here if we have this seasonal

1476
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,200
tendency mid july

1477
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,520
and the market's been bearish going into

1478
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,559
that mid-july time period

1479
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,160
we don't look for a buy we would look

1480
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,559
for

1481
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,800
a short-term rally to sell short into

1482
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,280
and then probably see a better

1483
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,960
price delivery on the downside as a

1484
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,520
result because the seasonal tendency

1485
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,000
would not be there and that gives us

1486
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
many times what i mentioned here

1487
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,920
it departs from the norm in price action

1488
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,359
it tends to

1489
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,599
incite excitement and price action and

1490
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,200
important opportunities

1491
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,359
so it's far more important for you to

1492
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,640
know

1493
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,920
this than an entry pattern because it

1494
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,480
gives you

1495
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,119
the foundation to why a market should

1496
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,240
have a big move

1497
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,319
because if you're in trading or trying

1498
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,760
to get into trading just to get

1499
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,720
10 pips 20 pips as a forex trader okay

1500
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,359
or

1501
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,680
try to make 25 pips as a weekly

1502
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,359
objective which is what i kind of like

1503
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,160
teach people

1504
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,359
to aim for in the beginning i think

1505
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,359
that's a reasonable

1506
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,920
objective it's not high and lofty it's

1507
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,200
something that i think that could be

1508
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,640
easily obtained

1509
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,160
and you could still make a career off of

1510
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,319
that as crazy as it may sound

1511
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,119
but i don't want you thinking that

1512
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,079
that's all you

1513
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,240
can do with what i give you here on this

1514
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,359
youtube channel

1515
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,440
you could literally turn this into

1516
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,640
whatever you want it to be you want to

1517
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,240
be a big swing trader catching mega

1518
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,200
trades

1519
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,599
well this is one way of going into it

1520
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,359
now notice i didn't even talk about

1521
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,599
commitment of traders you notice that

1522
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
did you also notice that i didn't talk

1523
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,799
about breakers

1524
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,680
or mitigation blocks you see what i'm

1525
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,200
referring to there

1526
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,079
i have a lot of moving parts but you're

1527
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,599
able to take

1528
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,920
what makes sense to you that resonates

1529
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,799
with you

1530
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,799
and say okay i'm going to use these

1531
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,480
things that make up my model

1532
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,960
but if it doesn't have things that are

1533
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,760
rooted in

1534
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,640
market truths you're not going to see

1535
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,680
those things pan

1536
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,920
out for you it doesn't make a difference

1537
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,079
the buzzwords the cool little names

1538
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,680
the things that you see me show you in

1539
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,839
your charts

1540
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,160
doesn't make a difference unless it's

1541
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,359
rooted and founded

1542
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,640
in rooted in a market truth and what is

1543
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,400
the market truth

1544
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,760
the markets will move

1545
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,079
based on a higher time frame premise

1546
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,960
and when we're referring to agricultural

1547
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,920
markets like

1548
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,760
foods and grains they are fundamentally

1549
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,400
driven by supply and demand factors

1550
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,520
those markets have

1551
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,960
real supply and demand every other

1552
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,160
market out there

1553
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,799
is manipulated commodities are a real

1554
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,559
market that has supply and demand

1555
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,960
factors that govern them

1556
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,000
they are the world's grocery store

1557
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,520
so they have a real value like

1558
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,040
corn is always going to be worth

1559
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,319
something but your share of tesla

1560
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,040
could be worth zero two years from now

1561
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,400
as crazy as that might say i'm not

1562
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:22,799
saying

1563
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,200
that's what's going to happen but tesla

1564
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,880
stocks you know the shares

1565
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,559
there's no real reason to think that

1566
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,480
there's value behind that

1567
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,799
or that it would be in perpetuity worth

1568
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,920
something

1569
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,359
it doesn't mean that but it's viewed

1570
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,480
that it has that value right now but

1571
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,160
corn will never go to worthlessness

1572
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,520
it's a food it'll always have value and

1573
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,160
in times of turmoil and what i

1574
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,400
anticipate going forward

1575
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,359
there's going to be a shortage of food

1576
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,880
and that shortage of food is going to

1577
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,400
put so much supply and demand pressure

1578
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,680
on these grains and that's why you're

1579
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,200
seeing these big extrapolated price

1580
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,359
moves

1581
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,960
why because it's fundamentally driven

1582
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,160
so if you're looking for supply and

1583
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,240
demand and you want to trade supply and

1584
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,880
demand

1585
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,480
you can't find a better way of doing it

1586
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,880
than trading commodities

1587
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,520
period that's real that's real supply

1588
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,960
and demand

1589
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,000
there's no real supply and demand with a

1590
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,880
currency

1591
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,520
it's all manipulated and in the cryptos

1592
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,920
manipulated too

1593
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,520
bottom line is this don't think that you

1594
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,079
have

1595
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,480
to worry about making money in these

1596
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,280
tiny little intraday fluctuations

1597
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,160
the same tools and premise that i teach

1598
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,720
with these

1599
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,839
intraday can be applied to the

1600
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,040
larger daily charts and if i would have

1601
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,160
just told you that

1602
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,119
this chart here for corn

1603
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,520
if i told you that was a an hourly chart

1604
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,119
or a 15-minute chart and didn't tell you

1605
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:01,440
what

1606
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,319
market it was you wouldn't have known

1607
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,480
any different

1608
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,599
because price is price but

1609
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,520
knowing where these big moves come from

1610
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,839
and putting your neck out on the line

1611
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,160
i do that and if i don't know what i'm

1612
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,119
talking about

1613
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,480
i would fall on my face miserably

1614
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,400
and you keep seeing me pointing to the

1615
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
next big moves pointing to the next big

1616
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,200
moves

1617
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,720
because i have almost 30 years of

1618
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,920
experience doing this

1619
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,359
i don't want to steer you wrong i don't

1620
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,880
want to see you fail

1621
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,359
i'm inspired by your excitement and your

1622
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:38,480
enthusiasm

1623
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,680
it motivates me it keeps me going

1624
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,839
because it allows me to relive moments

1625
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,160
just like you are having right now

1626
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,160
i went through that when you want to

1627
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,359
quit i went through that dozens of times

1628
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,040
when you feel like you hit a home run

1629
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,640
because you got

1630
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,559
more understanding and you can't sleep

1631
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,000
and you're excited

1632
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,680
i've been there i know what that feels

1633
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,000
like and it's amazing

1634
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,240
but nobody around you is going to

1635
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,839
understand that excitement

1636
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,599
because they think what you're doing or

1637
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,760
trying to learn is nonsense it's a pipe

1638
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,599
dream to them

1639
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,160
but i know i went through that i had all

1640
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,359
the adversity

1641
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,799
and everyone around me saying the same

1642
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,119
things it's a waste of time

1643
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,079
don't believe any of that don't listen

1644
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,440
to that stuff

1645
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,040
stop talking about what you're planning

1646
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,720
on doing and just do it don't share your

1647
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,079
dreams with other people

1648
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,000
because they're going to tell you don't

1649
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,200
bother

1650
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,400
who wants to hear that so

1651
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,720
dig into your charts dig into the videos

1652
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,400
that you find on this youtube channel

1653
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,079
start studying make 2021 the year

1654
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,960
that you've framed out a model that

1655
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,480
makes sense to you

1656
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,839
doesn't have to have all the moving

1657
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,839
parts that's available but something

1658
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
that makes sense to you

1659
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,200
that's rooted in why a market should go

1660
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,599
up or down and where it should reach for

1661
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,400
logically i teach that here on this

1662
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,920
youtube channel

1663
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,400
and if you put the time into studying it

1664
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,000
i promise

1665
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
you will find something that you can't

1666
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,520
find elsewhere

1667
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,400
and at least for free since i'll talk to

1668
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,760
you next time be safe

1669
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,200
and good luck and good trading
