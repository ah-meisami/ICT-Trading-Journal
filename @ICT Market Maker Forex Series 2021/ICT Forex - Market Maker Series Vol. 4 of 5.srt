1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
oh

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
all right folks welcome back this is

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,399
volume four a continuing series of five

4
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,760
parts

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,920
on the inner circle trader market maker

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
series

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
i'm gonna be teaching time and price

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
theory

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
all right keeping in sync with our

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,559
present market conditions and what has

11
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,000
transpired this week in

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,719
pound dollar no better way to learn how

13
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
to do something than to

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
apply it to a chart that's actually

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,239
trading and you watch unfold this week

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
we have the hourly chart here on british

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
pound versus us dollar

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
and with all the things that were

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
mentioned covered in the previous

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,119
volumes of this series if you haven't

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
watched obviously

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
part one two and three of the series

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,799
then you should not be watching this

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,520
video yet because it's kind of

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
requirement before you get to this

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
but the backdrop behind it is we've had

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
smt diversions

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
down here we've cleared out daily

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
cell stops so we've accumulated we have

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
a market maker buy model underway

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
and if that's what you're expecting and

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
your analysis leads to

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
a run above these relative equal highs

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
and above the original consolidation

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
here in the market maker buy model

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
let's incorporate the elements of time

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
and price

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,759
so now i have the daily dividers on and

39
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
how i did this in case you're wondering

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,799
if you're new

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,200
all i did was create a vertical line and

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,318
dropped it on

43
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,520
the zero zero level

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
on the time axis down here that's going

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
to be

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
midnight new york time if you have your

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,720
time

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
it's important that you have your chart

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
set to new york local time

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
that'll make understanding what i teach

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
easy to follow along because your charts

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
will look like mine

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,599
and also you'll be looking at through

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
the lens of the algorithm

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,160
so new york midnight time

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,720
is delineated each day so we're looking

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
at obviously today's

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
trading in friday thursday's trading

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,760
wednesdays trading

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,519
tuesday and then finally monday's

61
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,599
trading of this week

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,239
now when you're looking at this go back

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,800
and

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
look at your notes and we've outlined

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,000
how

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
this week of trading july 26 2021

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,800
to july 30th 2021 was bullish

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
four pound dollar i made the case for

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
why it was bullish

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
i pointed to where it was going to go

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,519
how it was going to trade there and we

72
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,239
have it here

73
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,360
now in hindsight so if you look at

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
each individual day as

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
one-fifth of the weekly range each of

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
these days have specific characteristics

77
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,760
that are

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
repeating in nature now they're not

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
always exactly the same

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
each week but what i'm going to teach

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,959
you here i've

82
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
covered in other lessons in this youtube

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
channel

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
but for continuity sake and kind of like

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
bring everything that you should have

86
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,640
collected along your

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
journey through all my videos here

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
we're looking at the delivery of the

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
weekly range and if we're bullish

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
the expectation is that there's a 70

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,840
percent

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
chance that the low of the week

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
is going to form on monday

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
tuesday or by wednesday's new york

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,599
session now right away you're probably

96
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,560
thinking oh that's

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
that's a pretty wide envelope of time

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,720
you got a lot of ways to you get it

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
wrong

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,839
well consider what we have here we have

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,918
monday's trading

102
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
we're already in a consolidation and we

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
left the consolidation

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
so is it likely to come back down

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
and go below this low here when it's

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
already taken out a low

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
there remember what i've taught you so

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
far in this series

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
before price movements that are

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
directionally driven

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
typically opposing stop losses

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
will be taken and then price will be

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
allowed to deliver

114
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
in your expected direction in layman's

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,000
terms

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
if you're bullish look for swing lows to

117
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,840
get traded below

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,639
and then it starts to move higher short

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,360
term low

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
trades below it then it starts to trade

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
higher okay

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,639
each day of this week was

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
predominantly bullish until we get to

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
friday obviously that ends the week

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
so if we look at a open high low close

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
perspective of the week we see the week

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
opening here

128
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
small little movement lower creating the

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,039
low of the week on monday

130
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
a retracement and a buying opportunity

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
on tuesday a retracement buying

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
opportunity on wednesday

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,199
and then thursday creating a short-term

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,000
high of the week

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
and then friday we went just above the

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
thursday high but not by much

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
and then we traded off the high and

138
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
we're probably going to close

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
anywhere between 139 20 and 139 big

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,199
figure

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
okay so going back to what i mentioned

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
here and what i've taught in other

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
lessons on this youtube channel is that

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
we want to be buying on monday

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
tuesday and at the best case scenario if

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
we missed buying opportunities on monday

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
and tuesday

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,319
we want to try to buy on wednesday in

149
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
the new york session okay

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,199
but we'll talk more about other things

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,000
that were factors

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
this week as we go into the series in

153
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
part five but

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
for now i want to bring in the opening

155
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
price each day

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
here at midnight so we have this opening

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
price here extended out in time

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,240
how far is this going out it's just

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
showing until 10 a.m

160
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
you can take it out till 11 a.m which

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
basically is the heart of london close

162
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
so the idea is if you're bullish you

163
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,680
want to be buying at or below

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
or very close to the opening price

165
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
each day we see it trade below the

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
opening price and rallies up

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
day here opens and trades down all

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,039
through london

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,000
and then rallies higher on the day

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
opening price here

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,759
we initially start to go higher but then

172
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
we trade down below it

173
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
and then we have another whip saw below

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
the low here on fomc

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
and then trades higher and then on

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
thursday we're not incorporating the

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,199
opening price on thursday and this is

178
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
for your notes make sure you

179
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199
write this down we're only looking for

180
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
the influence

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,599
of the opening price and buying below or

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,479
at it

183
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,680
in a bullish expected week on monday

184
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
tuesday and wednesday

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
thursday and friday they tend to create

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
the opposite end of the weekly range

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,840
okay so try not to be looking to be a

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,039
buyer on thursday

189
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
try not to be a buyer on friday with the

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
weekly range expectation if you do that

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
you're going to miss trades yes but by

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
far and large you're going to protect

193
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,800
yourself

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
by avoiding being a buyer in a market

195
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
move it's already been moving

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
okay obviously there's going to be days

197
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
where it just continues on thursday and

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
then friday really explodes even higher

199
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,879
i've seen it happen in my own trading

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
i've missed pretty big moves on friday

201
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
but i generally keep a small piece on as

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,440
i

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
illustrated this week with trading the

204
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,720
fomc

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,199
day so i bought on this day i bought on

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,160
this day here

207
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,879
and i recorded and shared the fmc trade

208
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
and put it on my telegram channel

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,080
you can see that and left a small piece

210
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,120
on it got me out at 139.50 on a limit so

211
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,639
you can design this

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
any way you want you can create a model

213
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,639
where you get in

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
on a tuesday after you've seen monday

215
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,039
prove that it's wanting to go higher and

216
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,560
then trades down below some short-term

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,039
low

218
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
picks up the stops and we have optimal

219
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
trade entry here

220
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,799
and you can be a buyer there and

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,640
basically allow money to trade without

222
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,440
you

223
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,519
or if you're hardcore and you're in

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
consolidation like this and you think

225
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
you are in a

226
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,719
move where it's here and you start to go

227
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
higher rate from monday's beginning of

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
trading

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
then obviously you can put a small

230
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
little position on there

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
and then consider maybe taking a larger

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
position once you have a better

233
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
confirmation of the weekly range

234
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
unfolding to the upside and a

235
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,120
retracement down

236
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,680
as a new student or a new trader when

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
you see a day like this

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
and most of you probably have one in

239
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
five minute charts up on your chart

240
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
you see this decline like it's heart

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
stopping

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,959
especially if you don't have any

243
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,160
experience you're thinking there's no

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
way i could be a buyer or that

245
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
well we have relative equal highs the

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
bottom line is it's going down to pick

247
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,839
up the sell stops

248
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
flood the market with sell stops

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
allowing smart money to buy those sell

250
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,560
stops

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
and then it takes off and goes higher

252
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
each day or this week

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,080
between monday and wednesday is offered

254
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
a buying opportunity

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,720
to get us above our target that was

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
established for the weekly range

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
was trading above here for the buy stops

258
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
so let's strip this down and go a little

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
bit closer

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
so we're zoomed in on an hourly chart

261
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
you can see here's monday's trading

262
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
tuesday's trading sweeping below that

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
short term low there

264
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,680
and rallying and we drop down here on

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
fomc wednesday

266
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,959
it starts to come down and give us a

267
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,399
buying opportunity here but then on

268
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
fomc two o'clock in the afternoon new

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
york time

270
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
the market whips down knocking out

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
traders that would have already

272
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
trailed their stop loss right below that

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
low it gets

274
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
tagged and then it runs aggressively

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
higher above that

276
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
original consolidation which is that red

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
line here so above that red line

278
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,079
is our buy stops that we were aiming for

279
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,839
that i started teaching you about in

280
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
earlier parts of the series

281
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
in the earlier portion of the week

282
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
then ultimately we trade creating a

283
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
short-term high on thursday

284
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
slightly higher on friday and then

285
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,959
profit-taking

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
model kicks in and you can see it

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,079
returning back to

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
that original consolidation

289
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
study the relationship of the opening

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
price at midnight in new york time

291
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
and how buying below that opening price

292
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,399
is ideal this is where smart money

293
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,680
accumulates longs

294
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
this is where smart money accumulates

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
longs and this is where smart money

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
accumulates longs

297
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
they distribute their longs on thursday

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,240
and friday if it offers higher prices

299
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,079
and then you expect price to come off

300
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,760
that and trade back down into the range

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
which is the highest high formed

302
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
intra-week

303
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,279
to the low and we're seeing that here

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
now if you look at it on a 15-minute

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
time frame

306
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
i'm going to incorporate day of week and

307
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,279
time of day

308
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
here's that opening price at midnight

309
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,839
the market trades down creating the low

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
in london

311
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
rallies comes back down in for an

312
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,560
optimal trade entry

313
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,519
if you don't know what optimal trade

314
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
entry is there is lots of videos on this

315
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,560
youtube channel

316
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
and you can study and find out what that

317
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
is it's a really simple pattern repeats

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
all the time

319
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
so it creates an awful tradition right

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
there you can be a buyer there

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,120
and then trades back down again we have

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
a short term low here

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
and a short term low here and this low

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,839
is during

325
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
new york open so short term low here

326
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
to high down in and taking out a short

327
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
term low

328
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
what's occurring they're taking out

329
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
short term stops right below here

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,240
and optimal trade entry rallies in new

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,399
york and continues higher

332
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,279
the next day the market trades back down

333
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,800
into the range that was established

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
in the previous day this right here is

335
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,399
the reason why

336
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
most of the time i'm leaving monday's

337
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,440
trading to

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
everyone else because if i establish

339
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
along here

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
and it starts to rally up i may make the

341
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,399
mistake of

342
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
trailing my stop-loss up to here and

343
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,839
then they take it on tuesday and then i

344
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,079
gotta go back in and reposition myself

345
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,040
so i wanna study on monday what they do

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,519
and then

347
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
on tuesday generally that's my action

348
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,720
day

349
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
and you can see there's a lot more

350
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
animation in price on tuesday

351
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,560
but look what they do they drop it down

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
into london creating the low of the day

353
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
taking out this short term low again the

354
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
previous day

355
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
and if you look at the low to high

356
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,680
you're getting optimal trade entry there

357
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
the key is ote or optimal trade entry

358
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
is associated with time of day

359
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,680
a kill zone these little hyphenated

360
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,920
segments of annotation on the charts

361
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
london is delineated by 2 a.m to 5 a.m

362
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
new york time so again if you're setting

363
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,360
your time on trading view to

364
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
local new york time always set it to

365
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
that no matter what

366
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,560
location you are in the world always

367
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
look at trading view

368
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
through the lens of new york period

369
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
if you do that everything i teach you

370
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,959
will make perfect sense you won't be

371
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,279
confused

372
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
but london kill zone is two o'clock in

373
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
the morning to five a.m

374
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
new york is seven a.m to ten a.m

375
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
and if you want to use the new york

376
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,000
session time

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,519
not the new york kill zone the new york

378
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
session time is 8 30 in the morning till

379
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
11 a.m new york time

380
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
but each turning point that occurs at

381
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
these kill zones

382
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
sets up a really nice run in price see

383
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
that little short term low right there

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,399
it trades down below it and takes off

385
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,160
so we're seeing this element of time

386
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
which is also associated with the day of

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,920
the week because

388
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,519
day of the week is still an element of

389
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,160
time

390
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
it's a it's a calendar reference point

391
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,519
to time

392
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,760
it's a block of time that we call

393
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
monday tuesday wednesday and so forth

394
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
so the element of time and price is

395
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,560
important because

396
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
you need to focus and expect your

397
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,839
analysis

398
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
to be rooted on the first element which

399
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
is time

400
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,639
the markets will not generally give you

401
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,839
setups that pan out

402
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,560
between these two windows

403
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
there'll be a quiet little period even

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
though we have a nice run in here

405
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,959
sometimes that will occur

406
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
most of the time it won't be like that

407
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
it'll be consolidation

408
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,920
and then after running close you get

409
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
these consolidations like this

410
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
this is like dead time again same here

411
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,720
dead time same here dead time

412
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
so we're looking to engage if we're

413
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,480
bullish like we were

414
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
teaching in this series pound dollars

415
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
bullish

416
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
monday creates the low of the week

417
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
tuesday creates a buying opportunity

418
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
new york on wednesday nice buying

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
opportunity but you have to have a wide

420
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,519
stop

421
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,560
and if you get stopped out here you can

422
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,519
use

423
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,320
obviously other approaches to getting

424
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,040
involved

425
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
with the marketplace with fomc but i'm

426
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,120
going to teach you

427
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,800
and remind you that you should not be

428
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
trying to trade fomc if you're a

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,959
developing student

430
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,040
because it's too much of a whipsaw and

431
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
you're going to get caught up with the

432
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,839
short-term volatility

433
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,000
and you're going to be more paralyzed by

434
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,519
fear even with a demo account

435
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
and left confused than that of if you

436
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
just simply study it from the sidelines

437
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,240
and don't engage it at all

438
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
okay but the element of time is the

439
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
first

440
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,440
crucial factor to reading price

441
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,639
price when it gets to these levels

442
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,519
that we look for below the opening price

443
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,959
okay what price is important below the

444
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,759
opening price

445
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,880
what time of day during london open this

446
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,399
these are buying opportunities here

447
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
this low trading below this low is a

448
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,160
reference in terms of

449
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,519
price by itself doesn't mean anything

450
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
sometimes you can see a short term low

451
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,040
like this

452
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
we have these lows here all three of

453
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,399
them one two three look at this we went

454
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,360
down below it

455
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
so that's one of those times where ict

456
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,959
talks about oh this is when

457
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
we went below the lows and expect price

458
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
to blast off

459
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
no because we're inside of a time window

460
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
that's not

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,120
important it's not salient to the

462
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
underlying

463
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
bias because it's dead the

464
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,839
time when the algorithm is sitting still

465
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
it's going to just

466
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
mark time it's all it's doing going

467
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
sideways just like it does here

468
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
and like it does here okay so the

469
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
element of time

470
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,679
is crucial because that's when the

471
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,520
market will

472
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,000
start to spool that means the market

473
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
will start unraveling

474
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,119
in one direction or another just start

475
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
shooting off into a specific direction

476
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,520
aiming for a particular price but

477
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
when you're looking for price to behave

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
a certain way

479
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
it needs to be inside of one of these

480
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,240
kill zones for the highest probability

481
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
after running close each day you should

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
train yourself to anticipate

483
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
consolidation unless we get something

484
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
like fomc

485
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
days which is obviously you know this is

486
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,000
something that is not an every week

487
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
instance but you need to be looking at

488
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
your academic calendar because if you

489
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
don't

490
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
you'll be caught off guard with these

491
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
types of events and

492
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
either want to be protecting yourself by

493
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
not being in the marketplace or taking

494
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
considerable amount of your position off

495
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,799
ahead of it

496
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
so that way if it does reverse on you

497
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,799
you've paid yourself

498
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,080
but time is the first element keying up

499
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,480
on

500
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
monday tuesday or wednesday for your

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
trading now this is a bearish week

502
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
same thing we'd be expecting a high to

503
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,799
form on monday tuesday or wednesday by

504
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,280
new york session

505
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,679
but after wednesday's new york session

506
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,120
probabilities start to fall off

507
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,360
precipitously about catching

508
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
shorts or trying to nail the high the

509
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,200
day when you're in bearish market

510
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,160
environments

511
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
this week we're going to stick with the

512
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
narrative that we've outlined initially

513
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
is that this week was bullish we've

514
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
outlined why

515
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,760
i gave you examples on telegram

516
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,799
and i showed you the fruits of it

517
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,559
using this information this little

518
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
exclamation point is just highlighting

519
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
the release of fomc data

520
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
okay this is two o'clock in the

521
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,679
afternoon new york time

522
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
expect the volatility and even though we

523
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,120
had

524
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
the run below these lows here and start

525
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
the rally up this is classic fomc

526
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
this is exactly what non-farm payroll

527
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
does generally too

528
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
so if this was 8 30 in the morning on

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,280
friday on non-farm payroll

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
this is what you would expect to see on

531
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,240
non-farm payroll if you're in an

532
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
underlyingly bullish market

533
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
same scenario so i'm but i digress

534
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,080
so looking at this from the element of

535
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,360
time and price

536
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,120
we know how to group an expectation

537
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,480
and perception of analysis when we look

538
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,880
at

539
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
time we know there's so there should be

540
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
something occurring

541
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,000
but we have to anticipate that something

542
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
rooting it to the bias what's the bias

543
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,919
do we think the weekly range is going to

544
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,039
be higher or lower

545
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,760
we don't care about that weekly closing

546
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,039
price i don't care where it's going to

547
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,919
close

548
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,919
where is the volatility going to send

549
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,000
price mostly higher

550
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
or mostly lower over the course of the

551
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
days of this week

552
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
if i'm thinking bullish i'm going to be

553
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
focusing on monday tuesday and wednesday

554
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
because i know the algorithm generally

555
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,440
presents the

556
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
really choice setups if it's bullish to

557
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
be a buyer on monday tuesday and or

558
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
wednesday but

559
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,039
by wednesday's new york session now

560
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,960
because wednesday had a high volatility

561
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,760
news driver with fomc at two o'clock in

562
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,799
the afternoon

563
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
that gives us a little bit more energy

564
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,559
likely

565
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,080
after two o'clock on fmc's release

566
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
and we see that happen here and it rolls

567
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
over into thursday's trading and

568
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
so on but knowing

569
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
where you should be trying to buy if

570
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
you're bullish you're trying to get

571
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
below the opening price at midnight

572
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
that's that's a threshold

573
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
that makes your trade higher in

574
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,799
probability

575
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,480
doesn't guarantee profitability it just

576
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,559
means it's higher probability

577
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,400
that you're buying a really cheap market

578
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,159
and you're buying it when smart money

579
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
buys it

580
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
you're looking at prices that trade

581
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
either to an optimal trade entry to an

582
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
order block or runs out

583
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,039
stops if we're bullish

584
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,440
when you're trading your your plan okay

585
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
you have to have plan right

586
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,400
the plan is every time you create a

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
short term low

588
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
notice to see if it does a run below

589
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
that while you're bullish

590
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
inside of one of these kill zones

591
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
relative equal lows you see that you

592
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
trade down below that

593
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
in london and below the opening price by

594
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
itself that's a buy

595
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
now you probably won't trust that

596
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,200
because you want to have indicators you

597
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
want to have moving averages

598
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
you want to have all these other things

599
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
that you put your faith in

600
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
all that faith that you established on

601
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
retail logic

602
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
and indicators and harmonic this and

603
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,400
supply zone that

604
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,799
just reappropriate those

605
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
faith tendencies only what i'm showing

606
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
you here because this is the truth

607
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,520
it's not about me okay it's not it's not

608
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,039
true because michael says it

609
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,280
it's true because this is the truth and

610
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
i'm just the

611
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,720
sounding board for it okay once you

612
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
understand this

613
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
and you start studying it like this

614
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
you're gonna see

615
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
it's always been there always

616
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,320
but these three days and this element of

617
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,400
time

618
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
that is crucial and what price where's

619
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,320
the price

620
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,799
factor in price is when you're taking

621
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
out stops returning to an order block or

622
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
an optimal trade entry

623
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
that's it there's three little things

624
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,679
there okay three little things that you

625
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,880
need to worry about

626
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
and not all three form at the same time

627
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,679
so you need not worry about well how do

628
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,799
i know if it's going to do this and how

629
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,080
do i know if it's going to do that

630
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,200
well look at you have a low here forming

631
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
and then it trades down below it again

632
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
that might be what you're waiting for

633
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,679
for your model you may not want to trade

634
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
older blocks you may not want to trade

635
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,159
optimal trade entries

636
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
you just want to see a low and then wait

637
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
and see if it runs below that low

638
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
during london at a time when we're

639
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
bullish on a tuesday

640
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
or wednesday and you could be a buyer

641
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,440
there expect price to rally up to

642
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,039
10 o'clock to noon which is london close

643
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,080
and that's usually when it's the

644
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
opposite end of the daily range don't

645
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
take my word for it go through your

646
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
charts and study it

647
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,600
that's what the algorithm will generally

648
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,880
try to do

649
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays when

650
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,559
the market is

651
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,080
predominantly bullish for the week

652
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,400
now obviously if there's an objective

653
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,679
that we're looking for on the week and

654
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,600
it hits it on tuesday okay so we

655
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
bullish on monday and tuesday it rallies

656
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,200
up say it went above

657
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
that red line which is that that buy

658
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,640
stop

659
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,159
liquidity pool that i've outlined

660
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,919
earlier in this series

661
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
and say it ran through that 20 30 pips

662
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,039
that would mean we have the potential

663
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,480
for the market to go into consolidation

664
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,600
the rest of the week or have a deep

665
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,279
retracement

666
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,039
whereas we see on tuesday we didn't get

667
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,279
to the high yet and sweep those stops

668
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,840
yet

669
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,919
on wednesday we didn't get to it until

670
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,840
here after fmc

671
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,640
but did it do it convincingly above no

672
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,279
it just went

673
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,240
really lightly above shallow shallow run

674
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
right there

675
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,480
and then later in the day when nobody's

676
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
really paying attention

677
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,360
it starts to rally straight on up

678
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
so you gotta factor the element of price

679
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,880
for where you think price is going to

680
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
reach for

681
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,159
so time and price theory you're blending

682
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,240
these things together to come up with a

683
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
narrative that you want to follow and

684
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,840
you want to see if price is sticking

685
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
to that narrative that you've outlined

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,039
or

687
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,360
scenario i guess it would be a better

688
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,279
analogy you're creating a scenario where

689
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,080
you think

690
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
based on these times of the day and

691
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
these days of the week

692
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
and the logic that this market's likely

693
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,840
to go higher to where

694
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,480
that weekly by stop liquidity pool

695
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,200
i've outlined in this series that we've

696
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,159
been harping on

697
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,200
every time we had a video

698
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
we're watching how all these things come

699
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
together to give

700
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,159
us a narrative that is delivering in

701
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,200
price

702
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
and nothing here's random it's exactly

703
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
how it should be

704
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
if it's bullish when should it create a

705
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,240
low to go higher

706
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
in one of these if not all of them

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
london and new york kill zones

708
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
just look at the chart right here these

709
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,159
windows of

710
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,679
time i taught this over 10 years ago

711
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,960
for free right on baby pips taught it

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
and they still worked today they were

713
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
working before i taught it

714
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,799
they're going to keep working okay the

715
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
reason why is because the flows that

716
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,039
come in

717
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,480
at that time of the day creates the

718
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
opportunity

719
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
for the algorithm to move around the

720
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
flows or buying volume and selling

721
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,720
volume

722
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,080
is not moving price the algorithm

723
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,960
is operating on the time window it knows

724
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,279
the

725
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,080
trading volume increases then it's not a

726
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,279
derivative

727
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,840
of okay lots of buyers are coming in so

728
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,200
i'm gonna

729
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
start seeing price go higher because of

730
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,200
that no that's not what it is

731
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
and i don't care who told you otherwise

732
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
it's not what's going on

733
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,840
these markets are absolutely manipulated

734
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,880
controlled

735
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
period the

736
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
the state of a country's economy

737
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,640
and the solvency of a central bank

738
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,440
is not going to be put in the hands okay

739
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
of

740
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,039
reddit i mean if everybody around the

741
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,919
world said hey look

742
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
here's what we're going to do we're all

743
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,080
going to buy the british pound

744
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
and we're going to keep buying and no

745
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,919
matter what

746
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,919
you really think that's going to be the

747
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,600
catalyst for the british pound to go up

748
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,799
and keep on going up

749
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,159
no matter what no way

750
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
but if you read social media today

751
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,440
that's what they want you to believe

752
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,799
that stocks are going to go to the moon

753
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,760
because

754
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
a handful of people on reddit are buying

755
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
it that's not

756
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,559
what these markets are doing okay these

757
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,039
are

758
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,159
the commodity these are the products

759
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
of a central bank their business is to

760
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,840
control

761
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,000
everything everything

762
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,360
and we as traders will never absolutely

763
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
never ever ever push price higher or

764
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,799
lower

765
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,360
because of buying and selling pressure

766
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
it's not going to happen

767
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
if they don't want to go higher it

768
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
doesn't matter how many people buy it

769
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,559
it isn't going higher that's it

770
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
so on the latter part of the week you

771
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,559
can see here on

772
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
wednesday's fmc we rolled into

773
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,000
thursday's trading

774
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,679
nice little optimal trade entry here on

775
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,760
london sticking to the theme

776
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,080
and we ran up 80 pips above

777
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
the 139 big figure the 139 10 level is

778
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
where that bicep liquidity pool was

779
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,880
basically linked to on the weekly chart

780
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,919
so we went 70 pips

781
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,559
above that that's a pretty good run and

782
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,200
here it is

783
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,360
we're on thursday in new york session

784
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
and then finally

785
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,120
london close creates the high the day

786
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,880
starts to drift lower

787
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,760
and then finally one more pump up in

788
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,640
london

789
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,279
on friday running just a little bit

790
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,200
above thursday's high

791
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
and then we have a breakdown and we'll

792
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,559
look at that on a five minute chart

793
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,919
but we'll look at that when we get into

794
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,000
the last part of the series

795
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,360
but each day has signatures that it

796
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,120
follows responds to in terms of time

797
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,159
and price it's not

798
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,440
something that is random it's

799
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,720
fitting specific logic that

800
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
has been taught in this youtube channel

801
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
i can't take

802
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
over 100 some different videos and

803
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,559
compress it into one

804
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,880
video and say this is all the moving

805
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
parts all at one time

806
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
but everything i'm showing you here has

807
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,799
been amplified in other teachings

808
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,279
introduced obviously in teachings and

809
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,399
also

810
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,760
shown by example and now here it is

811
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
again

812
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
being shown to you where it's still

813
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
working we're going to take a closer

814
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,279
look

815
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,159
into lower time frames in the final

816
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,120
volume on this

817
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,200
series until then be safe
