1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,079
all right folks welcome back this is

2
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,800
volume three of the energy trader market

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,920
maker series

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
in this volume i'll be teaching on

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
market structure key levels

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840
and smt

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
all right we're going to assume that

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
when you're doing your

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,520
qualitative analysis that means we've

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
already gone through all the

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
quantitative we're assuming the market

12
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
price is up here

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,520
and your analysis suggests that there is

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
a move likely to ensue

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
that takes us down to a key level

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
low now these key level lows can be

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
weekly lows old highs of

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
entire time frame like four hour daily

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,360
or monthly or weekly

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,840
they could be

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
the top of an old trading range

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
there's multiple ideas that could be

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
used for a key level but what makes it a

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,840
key level

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
is it's on a monthly weekly

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799
daily or four hour less importance

27
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,720
and significance place on the four hour

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
predominantly the higher time frame

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,119
daily

30
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
weekly and monthly now these

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
levels are important what makes them key

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
is because they're used by

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
large fund traders in their analysis

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
they're not really

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
going into these 15-minute time frames

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
one-hour charts and things like that

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
their analysis is predominantly linked

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,360
and founded on the monthly weekly and

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
daily time frames because

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
the volume that they work in and out of

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
the marketplace

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
requires them to be trading on those

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
time frames because they don't have the

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
luxury like you and i to get in and

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,720
trade on one minute charts

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
five minute chart 15 minute intraday

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
so the idea is we're expecting

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,640
where the market is now to trade down to

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,520
this level

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
and then a reaction should ensue

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
now your choice as a trader is if we're

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
here and you think it's going down here

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,599
to set up a move

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
to go later higher you can be a trader

55
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,239
from this point here

56
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
down or wait till it gets to this level

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
and then try to trade the bounce i'm

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
gonna leave that to you

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
to decide because a mentor should not

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
try to press everyone into a mode

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,959
it isn't a one mode fits all it's a

62
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
approach to understanding how price is

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
delivered and then you as a trader

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
find a strategy or a

65
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
process that allows you to engage price

66
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,879
action without you feeling like you have

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,760
to

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,519
meet the same expectations that someone

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
else is doing

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
so as the market trades down inside this

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,319
price swing

72
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
there's multiple opportunities in the

73
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,519
form of

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,280
swing trading short term trading day

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
trading scalping

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
and you can trade on both sides of the

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,879
marketplace but predominantly

78
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,400
the larger position and or more

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
risk can be assumed on the short side

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
whereas going long maybe scalping

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,159
something like that

82
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,840
counter trend to this expectation in the

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
marketplace

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
you'll use a lot less leverage and try

85
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,080
to be much more nimble

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
you know what your objectives will be

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
much more smaller

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
than that of if you were trying to trade

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,439
in line with this movement here

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,879
once it trades at this level here you

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
would expect higher prices and you can

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
trade obviously

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,439
with the majority of your leverage on

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
the long side

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
and any scalping or short-term trades

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
against this idea should be done so

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
with very low leverage and very

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,959
term price objectives now let this image

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,359
burn in

100
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
so that way when we transition to the

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
market maker buy model

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
it's this idea we have in mind here okay

103
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
market price is here we're expecting a

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
trade down to a key level

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
and then rally up

106
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,199
now these lows can form

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,440
two different ways you can start by

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
coming down

109
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,320
come off that short term low and then

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
make a lower low

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
creating the ultimate low in this price

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
swing here

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
and then price running higher this sets

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,479
up

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
a ict breaker where we have a low high

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
lower low once it breaks that short term

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,039
high in the middle

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,479
if it trades back down into that we

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,080
could be a buyer somewhere over here to

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
capture another continuation on the

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,039
upside

122
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
conversely there is another formation

123
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,560
you can see

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
where it trades down

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
it comes off the low and turns with a

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
higher low

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
and starts to trade higher this one here

128
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
i like to see this form only if

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
there is a smt divergence

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
that would be in a market that's closely

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
correlated to the one i'm looking at

132
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,639
here for the analysis

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
and what do i mean by that well let's

134
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
assume that this is the euro dollar

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
and i expected your dollar to trade from

136
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
its market price down to a key low

137
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
and then trade higher at this low

138
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
if i see euro making the low and then a

139
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
higher low

140
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,440
at the same time pound dollar is making

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,919
a

142
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
low and then a lower low that's an smt

143
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
divergence

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
okay smart money technique or smart

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
money total i never really settled on

146
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
the letter t

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
what it would stand for it was always

148
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
interchangeably used as

149
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
smart money technique or smart money

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
tool it's just simply a divergence

151
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,759
between

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
closely correlated assets or markets

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,400
what this indicates is there's a strong

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
disparity between

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,639
what the algorithm is pricing in for one

156
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,400
currency

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
versus another the theory i operate

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,600
under is

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
all boats rise with the tide and

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,960
if we're expecting higher prices in euro

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
it goes without saying that we should

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
reasonably expect

163
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,039
pound dollar to rally as well unless

164
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,319
there's other factors that are

165
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
outside the scope of this teaching that

166
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,360
would

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
negate that but for the majority of the

168
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,440
time in a general rule of thumb

169
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
all foreign currencies should be

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
rallying together and falling

171
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
dollar seen with that instance

172
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,160
here if we have a low a higher low in

173
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,720
euro

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
and cable goes low lower low that's

175
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
indicating that the algorithm is not

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,840
wanting to take

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
euro dollar to a lower low like it did

178
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
with cable or british pound versus us

179
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,560
dollar

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,120
and that crack in correlation many times

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
signifies a a

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,080
timing aspect that would be confirmation

183
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
to expecting this level down here being

184
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,880
significant

185
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
or key that leads to an upward price

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
swing later

187
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
okay with that idea in mind usually the

188
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,800
market will be in some

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
measure of consolidation i like to see

190
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
some kind of a short-term trading range

191
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
and it is very subjective this part okay

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
what is a trading range or a

193
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
consolidation

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
where price is having several candles

195
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,879
not two

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
not three not four but it just stays in

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,080
an

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
area over a prolonged period of time how

199
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
much time michael

200
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
it's all relative to the time frame

201
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
you're looking at if you're looking at a

202
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
15 minute time frame it could be

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,520
i don't know maybe 10 candles or more

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
and i'm just giving you a rough idea

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
because experience is going to guide you

206
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,000
on how

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
many candles really make up a

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,599
consolidation

209
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
studying price especially if you're a

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
new student this is going to seem too

211
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
vague and i had this complaint before

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,639
when i was teaching on baby pips as soon

213
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,039
as i

214
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
started to introduce an idea you know

215
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
right away they expect to have

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
the understanding entirely from one

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
lesson and you have to have

218
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
something of a comprehensive study

219
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
approach to what i'm teaching because

220
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
it's not simple but it is simple once

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,958
you understand all the moving parts

222
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,320
so from a modular standpoint when i say

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
that the market is usually in some kind

224
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
of a short-term consolidation

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
it could be you know consolidation on

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
one time frame but just simply two or

227
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
three candles on another

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
time frame that would be higher up so

229
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,279
it's all relative to

230
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
what you're expecting in terms of the

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
market price if it's

232
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
on a five-minute chart the consolidation

233
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,399
may look a lot longer

234
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
in terms of duration versus if you look

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,839
at it from a four-hour chart

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
it's all within one candle and you don't

237
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
even see a consolidation

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
but for the sake of continuity let's

239
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
just assume that we understand there's a

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
short-term consolidation here

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
i'll be giving you an example here so

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
that way you're not left with

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
too much vagueness so the market will

244
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
leave this consolidation

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
and inside this decline we wait for

246
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
another area of either

247
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
retracement back to the original

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
consolidation which it does

249
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,320
not have to do okay it does not need to

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,279
do this

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,640
this is kind of like what the

252
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
white golf theory folks will look for

253
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
there's lots of times where it just

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,839
doesn't do that

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,200
and that's why i don't teach why golf

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
that's why what i'm teaching here is not

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,839
wake off

258
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
so as the market drops down i allow

259
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
in my analysis the potential to return

260
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
back to the original consolidation but

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
if it does i need to see a very sharp

262
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
rejection there it can't just come back

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
to the original consolidation low

264
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
and then hang around for a little while

265
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
it needs to come back up there and then

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,959
break

267
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,120
i like it even better if it tries to

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,079
make an attempt to get back to the

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,360
original consolidation

270
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
low okay and fail to get there and then

271
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,839
breaks hard

272
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,600
i really like that because that

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
indicates a very heavy market

274
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,480
and it's likely to continue going lower

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
but either or

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
the next short-term consolidation and

277
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
this doesn't usually last as long as the

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
original consolidation up here

279
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
so what we're looking as a consolidation

280
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
a market that breaks lower

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,120
that maybe trades up to here and if it

282
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,680
does

283
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
we'll look for a sharp decline

284
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
if it doesn't and just goes right into

285
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
another area of consolidation

286
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
it usually will set up like an optimal

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
trade entry and if you're new to this

288
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,880
channel or

289
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,079
you're just watching this video for the

290
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,320
first time i have

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,959
a plethora of videos that teaches my

292
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
optimal trade entry pattern

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
it's very simple little pattern it

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
repeats every single day it repeats on

295
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
every single time frame

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
you just need to know what you're

297
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
looking for and why it should be forming

298
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,959
there

299
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,360
and this is really the point of this

300
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
lesson

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
is where in market structure should

302
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
things occur

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
and how do we interpret it and how we

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
anticipate it

305
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
so in this area here usually you're

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,640
going to see an optimal trade entry

307
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,360
short

308
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
it'll be a low retracement back up

309
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,040
into a bearish order block and then

310
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,079
slams lower

311
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,360
or it could be a low short term high and

312
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,120
then a higher short term high that runs

313
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,000
out

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
short term buy stops then it sells off

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,440
so

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
either one of those instances will allow

317
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:36,959
for

318
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,040
me to take a trade going short because

319
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
remember i'm waiting for some level down

320
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,720
here i've indicated

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
at the beginning of this discussion that

322
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
i think it's going to trade down too

323
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,040
or i'm watching price and i'm not really

324
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
engaging price i'm just

325
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
monitoring it and practicing and reading

326
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
price and i anticipate some measure of

327
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
selling

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
in this area or i'm watching price so

329
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,040
that way

330
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,399
it just keeps me closer to the

331
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,720
marketplace and i'm practicing either

332
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
with a paper trade or a demo trade or

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
i'm illustrating something with my

334
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
my teachings and lessons i'm just

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
anticipating whether i'm engaging or not

336
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,279
another price leg

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,959
lower and when it comes should it come

338
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,880
we're waiting for some kind of expansion

339
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
lower and

340
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
sometimes we'll get a secondary level of

341
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
distribution which will be another

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
either optimal trade entry cell

343
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
or a short-term high that's ran out with

344
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
a higher short-term high

345
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
and then leads to another level of lower

346
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,040
prices

347
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
until we get into that area where we

348
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,360
expect that key level to be reached

349
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
this is where the market goes into

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
smart money reversal okay usually it

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
will form

352
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
the same way as outlined in the price

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
swing where it will create a low

354
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,399
a lower low and then look for a breaker

355
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,600
or it goes

356
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
low high or low and if it

357
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
occurs like that again using

358
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,279
the inter market relationships i

359
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
mentioned earlier if it creates a low

360
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
with a higher low

361
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
versus one definitive load that takes

362
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
out a previous short term low

363
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
in other words the diagram i outlined

364
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
when it was just that big

365
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,160
blue v giving you a rough depiction of a

366
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
price swing the little animations i put

367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,160
in

368
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
at the low those are the only two things

369
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,519
that can happen

370
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
that's it so how they trade

371
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
and form in price leads to what process

372
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
you look for next

373
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,079
i'm not really interested in

374
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,440
a market that will give me a dull

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
flat blunt-ended low i'll avoid that

376
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
at all costs i'll avoid that because

377
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,480
that means i'm gonna have to wait

378
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
because we could be seeing just another

379
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
level of distribution

380
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,279
that leads to another break lower and

381
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,199
then i'll revisit the analysis

382
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
at a later time but if we see price

383
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
trade higher

384
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
we're going to assume that the smart

385
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
money has accumulated loans in here

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
they are not pushing price up when they

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
go long by the way

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
we're seeing price trade down to this

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
level and then

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
it kind of like spends a little bit of

391
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,199
time down here not a lot

392
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,800
and certainly nowhere near the length of

393
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,160
time that the original consolidation

394
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
looks like

395
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
very short term little consolidation and

396
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,519
the algorithm keeps price

397
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
in that range okay so it's a small

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
little dealing range it works in and

399
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
then it'll reprice

400
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
if smart money traders do not buy

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,760
they miss that move so they'll have to

402
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,600
wait for a low-risk buy

403
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
that usually will happen over here in

404
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,639
the small little

405
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,760
consolidation which will form in what in

406
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,519
the form of a optimal trade entry

407
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
by or a low

408
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
and then a short term lower low that

409
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,360
takes out buy stops and then rallies

410
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
remember when i taught in the previous

411
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
lesson in this series that usually right

412
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
before

413
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
significant price advances higher some

414
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
little short term lows taken out for

415
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
stop raids

416
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
and they assume those positions when the

417
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
stops are taken their sell stops flood

418
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,240
the market with

419
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
selling so that way counterparties that

420
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,480
understand what the algorithm is about

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,079
to do with price sending it higher

422
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,639
they'll buy those sell stops and they'll

423
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,600
be positioned for

424
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
a rally higher we would expect price to

425
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
trade higher until we get to another

426
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,639
level of accumulation

427
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,199
so what we've already seen here is

428
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
consolidating

429
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,880
and accumulation of shorts

430
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
accumulate more shorts accumulate more

431
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
shorts in this area

432
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
you may only get one area of

433
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,199
distribution and then it trades down to

434
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
the smartment reversal

435
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,240
where they distribute their shorts

436
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,480
down here so they're going to buy

437
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
to sellers at a low price and

438
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
everything they assumed over here should

439
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
be hopefully

440
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
offloaded here some of it here and some

441
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
of it here

442
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
so their heavy positions are entered

443
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
here some of it's taken off in profit

444
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,399
here

445
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
some of it's taken off in profit here

446
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
and here

447
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
or they'll go short here

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,440
add more here add more here and dump it

449
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
all off here

450
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
so there's two ways for them to engage

451
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,399
price

452
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,079
and work within this market maker buy

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
model

454
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
the longs that they assume here they may

455
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
not get them all on and not to

456
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,839
add more here and then add more here

457
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,320
because

458
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
as price is rallying up it's going to be

459
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
targeting the original consolidation

460
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,040
until it targets the buy stops above

461
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
this relative

462
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,880
equal high or consolidation all those

463
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
buy stops will be the target

464
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
of all of this so if you're looking at

465
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
price and you think that it's going to

466
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
trade lower to go higher

467
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
the original consolidation aim there

468
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
you might have a higher time frame

469
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
target some somewhere beyond that

470
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,959
but initially study all old price data

471
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,240
price swings and

472
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
you'll see this phenomena is occurring

473
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,000
and

474
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
you don't have to have all the

475
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,240
complications

476
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,799
that are introduced with retail concepts

477
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,079
i mean this might seem

478
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,919
too vague and it may seem an over

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,160
simplistic approach to describing

480
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,959
something

481
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,280
but i promise you go into charts and

482
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,039
study it you'll see this very thing

483
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,760
unfolding it happens on all time frames

484
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
and it happens on buy and sell this is a

485
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
market maker buy model

486
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,039
where they're taking price down not the

487
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,760
traders

488
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
the algorithm all the algorithms are

489
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
working together

490
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,240
it takes price down then allows traders

491
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
that know what to anticipate

492
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
to onboard here and then they take it in

493
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
scalings here

494
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
and here and finally the last bit of a

495
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
run it's in a hurry

496
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
to get above here and this is a complete

497
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,720
market maker buy model

498
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,480
this is unique to me this is something

499
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,280
that i introduced uh years and years ago

500
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
and there's been some subtleties you

501
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,640
know

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
people adding like off to it trying to

503
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,080
make it look like it's white golf it's

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,200
not like golf

505
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
it's very specific things and elements

506
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,799
that are over here

507
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
have to agree with over here and vice

508
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,240
versa

509
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
and again that's outside the scope of

510
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
this teaching but just know that there's

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
logic that is very precise it's

512
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
extremely precision oriented

513
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,559
but this general idea here will serve

514
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,360
you well as a

515
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,120
road map for studying price swings

516
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
now conversely we can look at price

517
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
doing the opposite where this is a ict

518
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,559
market maker sell model

519
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,679
we're going to assume that the market

520
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,520
price is down here and we think that the

521
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,799
price is going to go up to some

522
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,080
key high again that could be

523
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
running out of old high it could be

524
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,360
trading to an

525
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,440
old high and just falling short of it

526
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,320
because we don't think it's going to go

527
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
higher

528
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
it could be trading back into an optimal

529
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
trade entry so

530
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
and there's all kinds of things that

531
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,840
would be

532
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,440
outlining this as a key level but what

533
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
makes it key again

534
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,679
is it's a monthly weekly or daily level

535
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,480
and at the lowest four hour but again

536
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,960
i'm only

537
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,760
throwing the four hour out there as just

538
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,559
an extra

539
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,480
side note because predominantly the

540
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,679
levels are going to be key because

541
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,400
they're on this

542
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,960
top higher time frame daily weekly and

543
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,919
monthly

544
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
so as the market trades higher and runs

545
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,760
into that

546
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
you could be a participant in buying

547
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
that up or

548
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,360
studying it as it rallies up into that

549
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,080
key level and then the expectation of

550
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
lower prices

551
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,160
if it materializes this whole fractal

552
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
okay our price swing is what we're

553
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
trying to strip down to its

554
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,120
basic components okay what elements

555
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,360
occur inside this entire price range

556
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,480
that's what we're highlighting here with

557
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
the models

558
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
the high can form obviously with the

559
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
higher high

560
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,919
and then breaking down which sets up a

561
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,600
potential bearish ict

562
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,039
breaker which would be over here

563
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,280
somewhere but the high

564
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,120
and then higher high forming this high

565
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
this is what i like to see i'm more

566
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,400
confident with

567
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,880
this pattern but conversely

568
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
if we're looking at it where we have a

569
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
high and a failed higher high

570
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
and then it breaks here this is only

571
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
significant and

572
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
a market structure break if we have

573
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
inter-market relationship

574
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
confirmation again let's assume for a

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
moment that this is british pound versus

576
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
us dollar

577
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,559
and british pound versus us dollar makes

578
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,000
a high and a

579
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,919
short term lower high and then breaks

580
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,280
down

581
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
this is ideally a breaking market

582
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,840
structure on cable or pound dollar

583
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,440
if euro dollar makes a high low

584
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
higher high and then it breaks down

585
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
because that would be a

586
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,240
correlated pair smt divergence smart

587
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
money technique or smart money total

588
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
because what that is indicating is that

589
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,760
cable was

590
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
underlyingly weak from an algorithmic

591
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,280
standpoint

592
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
it was unable to make a higher high

593
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,559
where euro was

594
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,760
and i'm speaking hypothetically

595
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,320
obviously but that's how i would use

596
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,679
this lower high formation

597
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
so in other words if i think it's likely

598
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
to form a lower high then my

599
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
attention will go to a correlated market

600
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,559
like

601
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,280
again if this is assuming pound dollar

602
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
i'm going to be really watching euro

603
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
dollar and i want to see and if

604
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
this is occurring here in cable i want

605
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,000
to see and almost demand

606
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,200
that it's a higher high in euro now if

607
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,159
it creates

608
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,120
a higher high in cable and it creates a

609
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
higher high in euro

610
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,360
that means we might not be really

611
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
topping yet and i'll have to wait for

612
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
more information or a real

613
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,159
strong breakdown then i can get back in

614
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,520
sync and trade with it later on as

615
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,919
you'll see

616
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
all right again the assumption is we're

617
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
at a market price down here it could be

618
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:58,640
trading

619
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
in relatively cool lows or consolidation

620
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
and it leaves the consolidation

621
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
at this point again the same it could

622
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,919
come back to the original consolidation

623
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,960
high

624
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,559
but it doesn't have to

625
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
we're waiting for it to rally up into

626
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
another area where it creates an optimal

627
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,039
trade entry

628
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,400
long or it creates a short-term low and

629
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
then another short-term low that's lower

630
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,880
than it

631
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
it takes out cell stops and then we

632
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,159
anticipate higher prices rallying higher

633
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,919
until we get to another level of

634
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
accumulation so each one of these

635
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,200
levels over here is accumulation and

636
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
another point of advancement on the

637
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,520
outside until we get to

638
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,559
our key level where we anticipate smart

639
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
money reversal

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,520
okay so smart money reversal occurs

641
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,919
with some measure of consolidation not a

642
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,640
lot

643
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,720
okay but we're we're anticipating

644
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,679
expecting

645
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,679
the algorithm to kind of like hold up

646
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,880
there for a little while what's a little

647
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,840
while michael

648
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
again it's all relative to the time

649
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,120
frame you're studying because if this is

650
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,159
a five minute chart

651
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,480
it's not going to spend 20 candles in a

652
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,679
five-minute interval

653
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
up in this area you know what i'm saying

654
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,480
like it's it's going to be very

655
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
short-lived

656
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
whereas if we were on a four-hour chart

657
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
and we're seeing this pattern

658
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,960
and we're looking at a five-minute chart

659
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
then it's going to probably look like a

660
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
whole lot of candles

661
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,120
so it's all relative to what you're what

662
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,559
you're looking at through what time

663
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,520
frame

664
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,679
and again the way you learn how to do

665
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,880
this and

666
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,559
get better at reading what i'm

667
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,280
suggesting here is you look at old data

668
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,039
the back testing and studying of old

669
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
data every successful trader

670
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
every single one whether they come

671
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,039
through my camp or on their own or

672
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,720
wherever else they went through it

673
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,760
they're always going to be better and

674
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
versed

675
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
because of their own study the time they

676
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
spend looking at old data

677
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
and studying those price swings because

678
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
those things repeat

679
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
that element from rallying here up to

680
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,279
some key level

681
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
and then expecting it to trade lower it

682
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,559
will have all these

683
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,120
elements to it they might look slightly

684
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,799
different each time but they generally

685
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,159
have the same repeating themes

686
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
after there's a smart money reversal we

687
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,640
expect price to trade and break lower

688
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
until we get to another level over here

689
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
where we would see another optimal tread

690
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
entry cell

691
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
so it would be a blow a retracement back

692
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,440
in

693
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
maybe to a bearish order block and then

694
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
a displacement lower

695
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
until we get to another level of

696
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,480
distribution

697
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
now in here it could be the optimum

698
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
transfer cell or it could be

699
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
a short-term high and a higher

700
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
short-term high

701
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,400
and then break down same thing here

702
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
it could be an optimal trade entry cell

703
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,679
or a little retracement creates a

704
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,880
short-term high

705
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
starts to go lower and runs up one more

706
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
time takes that out the question you're

707
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
probably asking is when does it do that

708
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
when will it do that in an optimal

709
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,159
transit like for instance if you took a

710
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,799
trade

711
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,159
thinking it's an optimal trade entry

712
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
cell here or here

713
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
how do you know that it's not going to

714
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
be one of those trades where it takes

715
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,240
out

716
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
the short-term high that you went into

717
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
going short

718
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
and you get stopped out that's going to

719
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
happen i can't promise that you're going

720
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,760
to

721
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
you know walk through this marketplace

722
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
without having those cuts and scratches

723
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,480
and bruises

724
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,240
you might break a bone or two okay

725
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,400
you're going to lose some money

726
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
but let's assume for a moment you're

727
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,600
taking an optimal treat energy short

728
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
here this goes for the same thing i just

729
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,000
mentioned

730
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
on the market buy model this is a market

731
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
maker cell model just reverse everything

732
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,240
i'm saying here

733
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,840
for for the other one if

734
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
you take an optimal trade entry cell

735
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,679
here and it starts to go down and then

736
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,799
runs up and takes you

737
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,320
out of the trade then what you can do

738
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,120
is put a sell stop below the short-term

739
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
load that's formed thus far

740
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
and if the market goes down there it

741
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
could take you right into the market

742
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
sure and if it's going to do what we're

743
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,120
expecting here it probably isn't going

744
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,720
to do a short-term high a short-term

745
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,919
high it's higher then a short-term

746
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,039
height is higher

747
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,000
that's unlikely can it happen yes so

748
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,559
rare

749
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
it's probably never going to happen but

750
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,039
it can

751
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,400
so there's no reason for you to fear

752
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,240
being knocked out or kicked out of the

753
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
marketplace and take a loss because if

754
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,400
your

755
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
analysis is correct then

756
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,799
you're probably still going to capture

757
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,440
some move and overcome that drawdown

758
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
you've taken here

759
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
and if you get this other opportunity

760
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
over here and you have to stop around

761
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,760
here

762
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,039
chances are you're probably not going to

763
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,240
get a stop run here it'll probably just

764
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
be the optimum trading entry run

765
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,480
right from a bearish order block down

766
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
and it usually will be aggressive and

767
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,799
quick

768
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
to get down to the low of the original

769
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
consolidation where

770
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,279
cell stops are resting so this is the

771
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
elements to

772
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,679
a market maker cell model and again for

773
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,640
someone new

774
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,000
for someone that has not been looking at

775
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
price charts for a long time

776
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,279
this is going to look too elementary too

777
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,799
simple too big too well

778
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
it's not really showing me anything i'm

779
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
not really grasping it

780
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,559
but i promise if you go through your old

781
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,559
charts and look at a price swing say on

782
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,600
a four-hour chart

783
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,919
that does basically something like this

784
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
and then you study it from a 15 or five

785
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,679
minute chart and you'll see

786
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
this general idea

787
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,840
all right so let's go over to the

788
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,080
british pound and if you've been

789
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,200
following along

790
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,559
in recent weeks

791
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,600
the discussion on pound dollar

792
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
i gave you guys in this very series too

793
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
but let's take it back a little bit

794
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,240
let's assume that we're looking at this

795
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
level over here it's a daily chart it's

796
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
a relative equal low so you know what's

797
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,360
resting below that cell stops

798
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,039
and we're trading right here so we're

799
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
looking at this high

800
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,960
below and we retraced in and we look

801
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
like we're about to

802
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,000
break lower we have relative equal lows

803
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,840
in here so saw stops there

804
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,000
lots of cell stops there so we would

805
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
expect to see price trade down there so

806
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
this is a key level

807
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,600
ultimately price does cascade lower

808
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,320
all of this here my students and

809
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,600
mentorship we knew about this we

810
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,799
outlined this talked about before it

811
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,760
happened

812
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
and the market has now at this point

813
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
traded cell stops accumulated longs

814
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,880
and then we have these relative equal

815
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
highs okay in the last lesson in this

816
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,919
series

817
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
i talked about how this is the next draw

818
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
in liquidity

819
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,360
and the market trades up into that

820
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
on thursday of the week of this

821
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
production and today's friday

822
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,440
so the market trades up and we've

823
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
completed

824
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
a accumulation of sell stops and a

825
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,039
distribution to buy stops

826
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,080
smart money buy sell stops and sells to

827
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
buy stops

828
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,159
okay so we can use all this information

829
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,640
here

830
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
for the weekly range to get to our

831
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,399
objective on weekly pip objectives

832
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,520
let's assume that's this is that

833
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,799
area where we were looking for the buy

834
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,799
stops and this is where the old low was

835
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,240
on the daily chart where the sell stops

836
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,120
were

837
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,799
look what we have here the market's

838
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,640
consolidating

839
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
it leaves the consolidation but why does

840
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,679
it come back up here

841
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,279
it doesn't need to so it's better for it

842
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,960
not to do that and we have what we have

843
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
the level of distribution here because

844
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
we have what

845
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,600
optimal trade entry sells off

846
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,679
another level here optimal trade entry

847
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
sells off trades below that old relative

848
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,720
equal low on the daily chart it's that

849
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
blue level

850
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
on the daily chart there's equal lows

851
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
those sell stops are being absorbed

852
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,360
here the algorithm holds price in this

853
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,559
little consolidation

854
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,399
allowing smart money to accumulate

855
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,840
their buying does not send price up

856
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
it that's not how this works i know you

857
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,159
have books and they have authors and

858
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,679
teachers and want to be mentors that

859
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,559
tell you

860
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,880
that the buying sends price up like this

861
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
it does not

862
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,720
how many times have you seen people

863
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,640
saying oh yeah we bought this

864
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,159
and i bought i'm long i'm long

865
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,640
everybody's long everybody was long in

866
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
bitcoin

867
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
before 20 000 back in several years ago

868
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
and i called the top on that but

869
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
everybody was buying

870
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
but this still didn't send price higher

871
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,520
it went the other way

872
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
because these markets are manipulated

873
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
they're controlled folks i know it

874
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,840
doesn't feel good to hear that it

875
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,039
doesn't feel

876
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,799
warm and fuzzy because it feels like man

877
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,559
i really don't have a chance no in fact

878
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
you really do have a chance

879
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
if you understand how these markets are

880
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
manipulated you

881
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
follow suit with what the algorithm will

882
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,320
do you're not going to always know

883
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
i don't always know i know a lot i know

884
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,120
lots of times when it's going to do

885
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,600
specific things and i know when it's not

886
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,279
likely to do the things that i would

887
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,760
normally expect and i avoid trading

888
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,000
but in this instance here the market's

889
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
consolidating

890
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
allowing smart money to accumulate longs

891
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
once it takes off here they can't

892
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
they can't enter they've already missed

893
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,720
that opportunity so they're gonna have

894
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,399
to wait for some new level of

895
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,720
accumulation

896
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,519
we have a low a high optimal trade entry

897
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,000
in here

898
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,720
rallies up we have another level here

899
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,200
from this

900
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,760
low to this low that's optimal trade

901
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
entry because you have a high

902
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,799
low higher low boom

903
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,240
rally trades up consolidates

904
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,200
rallies again and then drops down takes

905
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,240
out that short term low

906
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,519
we talked about this in the previous

907
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,000
discussion or volume

908
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,039
and it accumulates and goes higher

909
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,679
the algorithm is driving price up here

910
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,480
it's not

911
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
the buyers okay it's not the buyers

912
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,480
the question is this if it was just the

913
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,919
buying pressure

914
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,440
why didn't it run from here all up to

915
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,960
break out above here because that's what

916
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,440
we were aiming for

917
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,080
why didn't run from here right above

918
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
here in one shot why is it doing all

919
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
this consolidation

920
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,679
i mean think about it if the buyers are

921
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,440
really controlling price

922
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,039
and in retail traders coming behind and

923
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,120
they buy it later chasing price

924
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,600
why doesn't all that translate into just

925
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
singular price runs

926
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,880
where it just goes in one shot because

927
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,840
that's not how the markets

928
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
look okay it's not how it works folks

929
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,440
all of these lows here are critical as

930
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
we'll talk about

931
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,720
in later discussions that are outside

932
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,440
this

933
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,679
video but nonetheless we're looking at

934
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,559
how price

935
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,320
trades down into levels that take out

936
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
short-term lows

937
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
short-term loans were taken here in

938
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
rallies short-term low was here

939
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,760
it took it out and then it rallies

940
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,799
short-term low here

941
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,039
trades down below it and then on fmc

942
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,880
fomc right there

943
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,399
it wipes it out one more time and then

944
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
rallies then it takes out

945
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,360
this level here which will be critical

946
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
later in other

947
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
videos in this series it ultimately

948
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,120
takes out all the buy stops

949
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,320
above this relative equal high and or

950
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
original consolidation

951
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,399
so this is a market maker by model this

952
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,200
was

953
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,320
what i hinged the analysis on in this

954
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,720
video series live as we were walking

955
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,480
through this week with you

956
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
and my mentorship students knew about

957
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,600
this as well

958
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,279
the bias why i was looking for what i

959
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
was looking for what i was expecting

960
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,600
in cable it's based on what i'm showing

961
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,480
you here

962
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
now there's a lot more things than

963
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,480
teaching mentorship students

964
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
that aren't going to be included in this

965
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,919
series obviously

966
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,399
and you can get upset and be mad or you

967
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,360
can say you know what

968
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
i appreciate what you're showing me here

969
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,399
this is enough you can make

970
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,519
lots and lots of money with this okay

971
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,120
lots of you don't need a job

972
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,840
you can win ftmos and you can do all

973
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,279
these funded account

974
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,679
contests and get funded using what i'm

975
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,120
teaching you on this youtube channel

976
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,480
you do not need to buy mentorship

977
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,120
i'm not offering seats to it anymore

978
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,320
that

979
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,600
area is closed down but this

980
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
is something you can study on your own

981
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
and go into your charts

982
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
and see what i'm showing you here

983
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
repeats over and over and over again and

984
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,519
in 2022

985
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,879
after march because i'm gonna take a

986
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,079
month off i'm going to be more

987
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,839
active on the youtube channel and i'll

988
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,119
be teaching a lot

989
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,760
of these types of things real time so

990
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,119
that way you'll be able to see over my

991
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,159
shoulder

992
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,000
what i think is going to happen and i'm

993
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
going to just use

994
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,199
what you've been introduced in this

995
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
youtube channel and you're going to see

996
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,119
how

997
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,879
quickly and easily you can hit the

998
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,599
ground running and find consistency

999
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,079
and i'll be like a little bit of a guide

1000
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,119
through youtube doing that

1001
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,440
now we're going to talk about smt smart

1002
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,119
money tool or smart money technique

1003
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,960
when we're down below these relative eco

1004
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,000
lows on

1005
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,599
british pound we're expecting price to

1006
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,599
accumulate those sale stops but how do

1007
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,399
we know

1008
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,480
that that's really going on how can we

1009
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,760
trust that

1010
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,880
well bring in the dollar the dixie

1011
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
dxy is being overlaid on the

1012
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,359
pound dollar chart and on trading view

1013
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,760
you can see that the dollar index went a

1014
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
little bit higher than this short term

1015
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
high there

1016
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,760
at the same time

1017
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,839
pound dollar was unable to go lower than

1018
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,680
its previous low

1019
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,400
now think if the dollar is going higher

1020
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,560
pounds should be going lower but if

1021
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
pound is going higher dollar should be

1022
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
going lower

1023
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
vice versa but if you look for times

1024
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
when there should be

1025
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,760
a key level influencing price

1026
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,839
this is when you go to smt now i taught

1027
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,160
smt on baby pips like 10 years ago

1028
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
and everybody took that

1029
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,079
and ran with it and tried to make smt

1030
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,480
occur

1031
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
on all time frames every time they

1032
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,079
wanted to get a trade

1033
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,040
they're looking for it you only consider

1034
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,720
using smt

1035
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,040
which is a divergence between correlated

1036
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
or inversely correlated markets

1037
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,359
if you're looking at the dollar index

1038
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,800
against the pound or if you look at the

1039
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,640
dollar index versus the euro or

1040
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,680
the dollar index versus the australian

1041
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,760
okay that's a usdx smt divergence or

1042
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,640
dollar

1043
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,400
smt if you're looking at

1044
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,599
correlated pairs that are like

1045
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,000
euro and cable or like let's say this

1046
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,839
way euro dollar

1047
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,359
comparing its lows to pound dollar

1048
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,320
that is a correlated pair smt divergence

1049
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,520
if you see them

1050
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,839
break their correlation in other words

1051
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,839
this is a breaking correlation

1052
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,240
this high with a higher high on dollars

1053
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,839
should have been seen with a low and a

1054
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,440
lower low on cable

1055
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
but notice what's happening this right

1056
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,599
here

1057
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
is how the algorithm tips off

1058
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,400
the traders that are in the know

1059
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,839
we already know going below those wealth

1060
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,000
of equal lows that their cell stops down

1061
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
and it's probably going to go down there

1062
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
accumulate and go higher that's

1063
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,280
likely but how do we really know and

1064
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,640
trust that's going to happen

1065
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,400
the dollar index gives us the insight

1066
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,640
the x-ray view if you will

1067
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,760
where it went high higher high

1068
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
low failed lower low so it's

1069
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,839
telling the traders without really

1070
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,440
broadcasting it

1071
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
that okay cable's gonna start going

1072
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
higher because it failed

1073
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,800
to make that lower low where the dollar

1074
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,079
made the higher high

1075
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,760
so this is smt divergence higher high

1076
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,200
higher low this is occurring at the same

1077
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,760
time

1078
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,920
we're below those daily equal lows and

1079
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
we're expecting price to go higher

1080
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,000
anyway and all this does is confirm

1081
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,119
smt is not a timing tool it's a

1082
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,720
confirmation tool

1083
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
okay it confirms something that you were

1084
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,720
already expecting anyway

1085
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
and this is why a lot of folks that

1086
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,480
learned from me on baby pips

1087
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
thought that oh smt doesn't work it

1088
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
doesn't work because i tried to look for

1089
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,200
here and there

1090
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
and it failed here it failed there you

1091
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,480
don't go into your charts looking for

1092
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
divergence between highs and lows that's

1093
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,640
not

1094
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,440
what you're doing you have to have logic

1095
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,480
and some measure of a

1096
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,560
narrative behind what it is you're

1097
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
looking for otherwise the divergence

1098
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,560
could

1099
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,280
be there momentarily and then completely

1100
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,079
evaporate

1101
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,480
and then what you trade on you trade it

1102
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,960
on the basis of like an indicator

1103
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
and this is not an indicator when it's

1104
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,800
done correctly because i'm comparing the

1105
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,000
price of one

1106
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
benchmark currency the dollar versus

1107
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,320
another currency pair

1108
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,720
and they should be mirroring one another

1109
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,359
okay

1110
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,720
so if this is high or high this should

1111
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,320
be low or low if it doesn't do that

1112
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
that to me indicates as a cracking

1113
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,400
correlation therefore it's tipping off

1114
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,720
algorithmically this is the signal it

1115
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,520
sends

1116
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
it's not oh it went down and there was

1117
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,040
not enough sellers to send it lower

1118
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,000
that's not what that

1119
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,720
is it also isn't a low and there's too

1120
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,560
many buyers to let it go down

1121
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
it's not that either i'm telling you

1122
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,599
what it is

1123
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,800
i'm telling you exactly what it is and

1124
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,160
majority of you aren't going to agree

1125
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
with it because you know

1126
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
you probably read 14 books okay or

1127
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,320
watched a couple videos on somebody

1128
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,680
else's youtube channel

1129
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
and they swear up and down that it's

1130
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,040
this and it's that and they

1131
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,960
maybe have exotic cars that they're

1132
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
leasing and they're trying to convince

1133
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,800
you

1134
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,000
with stacks of money they're carrying

1135
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,440
around with them all the time going on

1136
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
trips

1137
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,800
go into a chart okay and use these

1138
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,040
things i'm teaching you okay and study

1139
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,839
like that

1140
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,599
and you'll learn far more than any book

1141
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,880
out there is going to give you because

1142
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,160
most of the books that's being written

1143
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,560
now

1144
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
are just bleeding information from what

1145
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,280
i'm giving you here on this youtube

1146
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,720
channel or for my mentorship

1147
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
and that's the truth and if it sounds

1148
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,200
arrogant i'm sorry if it sounds arrogant

1149
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,720
i'm not trying to be arrogant

1150
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,079
i'm just telling you if you're going to

1151
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,000
learn how to do this you need to learn

1152
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,880
it from the source

1153
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
and that's me i'm going to show you how

1154
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,320
to use this stuff and make money with it

1155
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,440
real money not demo dollars that i teach

1156
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
through for compliance reasons because

1157
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,800
i'm not licensed to give you trade

1158
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,440
advice

1159
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,160
but i promise you this if you learn this

1160
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,960
stuff

1161
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,800
and you get good with a demo account

1162
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
what separates

1163
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,720
the ability for you to do the same thing

1164
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,400
in a demo account in a live account

1165
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,920
fear and greed and i have

1166
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,359
modules in this youtube channel to help

1167
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,440
you conquer that also

1168
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
so there's no reason for you not to be

1169
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
making money there's no reason for you

1170
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,079
not to be passing

1171
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,760
a funded account challenge so that way

1172
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,720
you can get out here and start making

1173
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,839
money because times are going to start

1174
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,240
to get real tough soon folks

1175
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
real tough and if you're relying on your

1176
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,520
job

1177
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,319
i'm telling you you are setting yourself

1178
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
up for failure

1179
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
i could be your best friend and all you

1180
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,079
got to do is a pad

1181
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,760
and pen sit down take notes and study

1182
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,800
and experience will guide you i'm going

1183
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
to put you in the right place

1184
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,960
in studying but all that work is on you

1185
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,319
you have to do all this stuff you have

1186
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,960
to study it and go through example after

1187
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,119
example of hindsight data

1188
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,200
and then you train yourself to see these

1189
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,720
things

1190
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
you don't go in looking for divergence

1191
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
because that's the same thing as a

1192
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,720
student that

1193
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
trades with retail logic will look at an

1194
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,760
rsi and say okay

1195
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,200
it's going higher and higher but look at

1196
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,440
this rsi it's diverging variously

1197
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,520
and they try to go short and they get

1198
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,560
their clock cleaned

1199
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,839
and just keeps on going higher

1200
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,720
it doesn't make a difference what

1201
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
indicator you slap on that chart

1202
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
they're all going to flash bare signals

1203
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
okay because it's

1204
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
measuring mathematically a number of

1205
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
bars in the past

1206
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,119
and by default it's going to be

1207
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
going lower and people don't understand

1208
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,480
that because they're not they're not

1209
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,839
versed in basic math okay there's simple

1210
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,720
things

1211
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,760
that you're being tricked by but because

1212
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,520
they show example after example that

1213
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,000
doing this or that in the past

1214
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,960
then you go into thinking okay well i

1215
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,520
believe

1216
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,720
that this is going to happen because

1217
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
i've seen it in the book four or five

1218
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,119
times

1219
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,800
never seen the author trading with it

1220
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
never seen the author doing it with a

1221
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,280
live account

1222
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,599
never seeing them show you in live

1223
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,720
market conditions

1224
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
you don't see those things but they have

1225
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,480
cherry picked hindsight examples

1226
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,599
where they're talking about the left

1227
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,079
side of the chart all the time

1228
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,680
i did this series i did this series

1229
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,800
again for youtube but i used

1230
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,079
real market action real analysis

1231
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,800
to deliver it

1232
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,359
how better can you expect from a mentor

1233
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,160
to be able to do it outline it i signed

1234
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
my name on it where i thought cable was

1235
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
going to go

1236
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
and here it is i did it on a week during

1237
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,640
fomc

1238
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,680
and i even traded fomc i put the trade

1239
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,400
on my

1240
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,599
telegram it's there you can see it

1241
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,040
and it went up and traded and i did a

1242
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,079
one shot one kill set up with that

1243
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,839
all of that with this logic here

1244
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,760
better view of what i'm referring to

1245
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,319
here is smt divergence

1246
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,920
on the right hand side it's the chart of

1247
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,599
the pound dollar and the left-hand side

1248
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,800
it's the dollar index

1249
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,480
here's that higher high in its own chart

1250
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
and then here's that higher low on its

1251
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
independent chart on cable

1252
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
so these two price points are

1253
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
correlated to these two price points

1254
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,319
this

1255
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,000
should have went to a lower low than

1256
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
this one it didn't

1257
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,440
but because it didn't do that and were

1258
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
below those relatively cool lows

1259
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,520
on the daily chart on cable this was

1260
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,359
accumulation of longs

1261
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
the algorithm is signaling to interbank

1262
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
traders this is

1263
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
going to go higher not because of buying

1264
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,480
and selling pressure

1265
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,760
deficiencies but because it's being

1266
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,839
controlled and manipulated

1267
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,000
don't take my word for it i don't want

1268
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,119
you to believe me

1269
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,800
i don't want you to believe me at all

1270
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,160
about what i'm showing here i want you

1271
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,359
to go into the charts

1272
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,480
and study it with this premise in mind

1273
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,960
go into it looking to disprove what i'm

1274
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,839
saying

1275
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,119
and you're going to shock yourself

1276
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,720
because it's there it's been there all

1277
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,760
this time

1278
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,520
and until i started talking about it no

1279
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,079
one paid any attention to it

1280
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,839
so until we talk next time be safe
