1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,580
well welcome back folks so we are

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,500
looking at a rather brief overview of

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,960
the importance of journaling

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,699
and while I could have made this an

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,420
extremely long video I took more time

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,460
actually doing

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,620
the annotations then this presentation

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,840
will actually take to cover it but I

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,059
don't want you to discount

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,280
the measure of importance

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,620
that this topic has because

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,260
all of my profitable students everyone

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,579
has found their consistent model

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,320
everyone that knows exactly what they're

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,660
doing within price action whether it be

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
a day Trader's capacity short-term

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,980
Trader position Trader swing Trader

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,780
whatever it is

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,420
they went through this process they

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,860
didn't go through

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,560
a rushed pace of going out there and

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
trying to get

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
real profits before they were ready

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,180
and they spent time with this

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,340
before actually trying to demo trade or

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,260
paper trade

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,360
so if you'll give me a few minutes to

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
kind of like lay down some Foundation

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
here it's really important that you

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,420
listen to this part especially if you're

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,920
a new student or if you are a student

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,860
that has yet to find consistency

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,340
I promise you it's this very thing

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,320
that you're not doing and you're

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,939
probably not doing it long enough for

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,380
your personal

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,079
unique experience to

38
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,299
basically identify what it is that you

39
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,119
want to be Trading

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
often there are students that will come

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,140
to me and they'll watch just a few of my

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,220
videos

43
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,020
or they'll watch something new that I I

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,180
released for the first time and teach on

45
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,759
that specific element of my trading

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,579
style they want to rush into it thinking

47
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,759
they understand every aspect of it

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,000
and they don't really incorporate this

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,440
part of it

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,440
because it's very easy to get lost

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,660
in the chaos of price action when you're

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,760
just looking for one little thing

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,980
one component one little

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,599
Cog in the wheel

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,300
that makes this machine go

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,120
and that being as simple as a fair value

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,020
Gap

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,440
an order block an optimal trade entry a

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,860
breaker any one particular thing

60
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,800
in and of itself is not enough

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,720
you have to have a

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,819
well-rounded approach to reading price

63
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,500
action and the only way you're going to

64
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,120
get that and it's not by watching my

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
videos

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,879
it's not by watching other people's

67
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,940
videos it's not watching me trade live

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,980
or even watching my examples

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,940
it's by you going into the charts doing

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,340
this very thing tonight

71
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
now

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,959
admittedly

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,120
I can understand how some of you

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,819
probably the majority of you

75
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,459
are going to watch this video and think

76
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,900
you've already said this before or

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,819
that's all well and good but I don't

78
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,940
have time for this I need to make money

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,580
or I got to get to the point and find

80
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,459
the trade set up for myself and you'll

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,560
be like one of those in my community

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,840
where they'll complain

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,239
that they don't know how to find their

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,659
model or they can't read price action or

85
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,159
they're confused about where price is

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,819
going to go next or

87
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,620
they'll be asking me after I get

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
something correct in terms of where I

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,400
call the Market immediately they want to

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,260
go in and ask me what next

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,099
the folks that do this

92
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,760
part of it

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,940
this aspect of learning how to read

94
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,280
price action which is

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,640
back testing now back testing again is

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,599
to me it's not about taking a trade

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,939
it's not about going back air and using

98
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,620
a Forex replay or a market replay or

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,440
Market replay reports if you're using

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,839
ninjatrader

101
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,060
if you're just going back and looking at

102
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,740
the numbers

103
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,020
okay I want to talk to a crowd that uses

104
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
ninjatrader

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
you might see

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
folks out there on YouTube or other

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,180
mediums on social media and they'll post

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,600
Market replay reports and it says

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,660
this is how many trades were taken both

110
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,699
long and short and here's the net

111
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,280
results and you're just seeing the

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,460
numbers

113
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,960
unless you know what it is that you're

114
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
doing

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
why that specific

116
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,780
price action should be delivering the

117
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,259
way it should be or how to identify it

118
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,680
that allows you to go in and repeat that

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,060
same procedure that protocol that would

120
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,759
establish a reason to assume that the

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,220
Market's going to go higher or lower why

122
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,380
should the market go higher and lower

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,600
why should the market go to a discount

124
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,419
from a premium or from a premium to a

125
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,540
discount

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,460
those factors

127
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,979
in price action are critical

128
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,680
for you to be able to be successful and

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
consistent

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
but the secret recipe to all of this is

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,759
how much time you spend in a chart not

132
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,180
just simply gazing into it

133
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,100
with no real understanding of what it is

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,960
you should be looking for if that's

135
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,100
where you're at

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
if it looks like a foreign language to

137
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,400
you when you look at these candlesticks

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
I promise you it's because you have not

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
gone through the step that we're going

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,580
to cover tonight now I talked about it

141
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,919
in length over the years

142
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,780
and there are many ways to record

143
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,020
a journal experience for yourself

144
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,300
there are wonderful apps out there I'm

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,680
not going to name them by name because

146
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,840
you're going to assume I have some

147
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,520
affiliation with them which I have no

148
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,560
affiliation with any company

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,060
I don't get Kickbacks I don't get

150
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,380
affiliate link

151
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,080
bonuses or I don't get any kind of

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,139
financial Kickback from any company or

153
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,780
anything that I say if I like something

154
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,120
it's the honest truth and I'm sharing

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
what I believe about it if I don't have

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,020
an affinity for insulting or if I say I

157
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,539
don't like something that's my opinion

158
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,039
and

159
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,979
I want to remain that way I get a lot of

160
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,199
offers by companies that want to do some

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
kind of affiliate program and I don't do

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
that because as soon as I do that that

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,960
makes me

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,259
well in my opinion

165
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,240
someone that would be viewed as

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,460
led to say something because of some

167
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,199
kind of payment that would be made to me

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,060
that's why I don't do any kind of

169
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,160
advertising that's why I don't do any

170
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,380
kind of affiliate marketing none of that

171
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,699
stuff and I can make a lot of money

172
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,259
doing that but I choose not to do that

173
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,240
because I want you to trust my opinion

174
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,220
when I say something about something in

175
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
particular whether it be

176
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,479
a broker an application some kind of

177
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
resource or whatever if I say something

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,020
it's

179
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,139
used by me and if I like it that company

180
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,060
that resource that

181
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,639
whatever it is the application they did

182
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,960
not pay me

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
and I wouldn't take anything from them

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,560
if they tried so it's a very honest way

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,180
of doing things and I like to do that

186
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,340
and everything that I do so that way

187
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,440
when you listen to me you can trust me

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,900
and one of those things tonight

189
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,479
is trust me when I tell you that this is

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
the very thing that you have not done

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,020
enough of if you haven't found

192
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,699
consistency yet

193
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,259
if you haven't found your model if you

194
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,759
haven't found the trust

195
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,520
in understanding what order flow is

196
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,000
my order flow not the things that we see

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
banded about in this industry as order

198
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
flow

199
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,479
everything in these candlesticks tells

200
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,699
you everything that you need you don't

201
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,199
need to know volume

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,860
you don't need to know what the v-wop is

203
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,599
you don't know where the pawning control

204
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,639
is you could care less

205
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,900
you just need to know where the

206
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,000
inefficiencies are and where are the

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,699
liquidity above and below and you need

208
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:27,840
to know the time of day and what day of

209
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
the week you're at

210
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
none of that has anything to do with an

211
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,580
indicator

212
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,219
none of it has anything to do with any

213
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,440
kind of gimmick

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,240
that you have to apply to your chart you

215
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,919
don't need any of that stuff

216
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,180
but this I promise you this is the very

217
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,580
thing that you have to spend the most

218
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,760
time doing in fact you're going to spend

219
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,860
the rest of your career doing this very

220
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,940
thing

221
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,800
if you want to run it like a business if

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
you want to be extremely precise

223
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
detail-oriented

224
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,300
consistent

225
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,839
this is how you get it

226
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,100
so we're looking at the NASDAQ and I'm

227
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
showing you the NASDAQ continuous chart

228
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,180
so

229
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,980
if you're a user of trading View and I

230
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,540
hope that you are because it makes

231
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,779
learning from me a lot easier

232
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,300
the symbol is NQ number one and the

233
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,980
exclamation point

234
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,860
okay so if you put that into the symbol

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,899
window on trading View

236
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,339
and you put it up

237
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,300
on a one month time frame you'll see

238
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,519
this very chart here

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,519
okay at the time of this recording this

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,600
is

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,940
the time I captured a chart and I worked

242
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,560
on it a few hours capturing all the

243
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,660
annotations working out the details to

244
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,279
show you this stuff so like I said I

245
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,899
spent more time doing

246
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,200
the actual slides then it would take you

247
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,959
to do the actual

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,019
procedure of doing it okay logging in

249
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,959
your annotations and making the hard

250
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
time frame PD arrays visible on the

251
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,459
lower time frame and then working with

252
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,180
them on a day by day basis and on the

253
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,140
weekend

254
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,540
referring back to each day now I'm not

255
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,920
going to do the individual days today

256
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
because for

257
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,459
the sake of brevity

258
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,160
and also for your homework I'm going to

259
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
give you all of the pertinent

260
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,260
PD arrays that you should use one of the

261
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,640
lower time frames that being the 15

262
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
minute time frame five minute time frame

263
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
all the way down to the one and if

264
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,339
you're so inclined

265
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,779
less than a one minute chart

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so the same thing I'm using here you

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,740
would use for euro dollar

268
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,959
if you're a Forex Trader the dollar

269
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,220
Index

270
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,760
you could use this on the e-mini S P you

271
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,779
can use it on any commodity any Market

272
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,079
okay so we're doing a top-down approach

273
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,000
but we're doing it so that way we can

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,980
look at how the importance of the higher

275
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,120
time frame

276
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,519
down to the lower time frame and how the

277
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,399
pdra Matrix is utilized throughout the

278
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,019
time frame

279
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,600
higher to lower

280
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,279
so we're looking at the monthly chart

281
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,120
here

282
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
and I want you to take a look at this

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
and pause the video for a moment and

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
think about what it is that you identify

285
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
in the most recent months so in the last

286
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,540
few candles in here

287
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,420
what did price refer to and what is

288
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,640
presently in price that might be useful

289
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,720
going forward

290
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
if you don't pause the video I promise

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
you you're not getting the most out of

292
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,940
The Learning Experience

293
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,079
all right for the folks that

294
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,899
did not pause I'm going to show you now

295
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,120
all right so here's the monthly chart

296
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,459
and looking at the monthly time frame I

297
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,779
want you to see and that kind of like

298
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,519
this will be somewhat of a

299
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,079
a review

300
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,440
also is showing you an example how you

301
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,019
might want to journal so you want to

302
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,940
bring in your own unique personality to

303
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,579
this I'm just giving you

304
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,700
the basic approach to annotating your

305
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,279
chart and how you might record some

306
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,740
observations but you might want to

307
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,680
include a lot more

308
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
self-love okay something that you might

309
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
want to do in your annotations is

310
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
really write in those

311
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
types of comments that you saw it coming

312
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
even if you didn't really see it coming

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,519
you're conditioning your subconscious

314
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,680
by recording these pseudo experiences

315
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,660
that way you're tricking your brain into

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
seeing something at a later time

317
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,220
referring back to these as examples like

318
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,440
on the weekend or say a couple weeks ago

319
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
you'll look at your Journal

320
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,680
and by looking at them with these

321
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,160
annotations and reading them out again

322
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,339
your brain sees these PD arrays and the

323
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,380
PD arrays are things like

324
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,959
the ferry Gap here

325
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,519
the breaker here

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,560
you're probably asking yourself you know

327
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,079
how could this be a breaker well we had

328
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,160
a high here

329
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,620
we dropped down and then we went higher

330
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,300
when the lower time frames this would

331
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,860
look obvious

332
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,320
as a breaker but this is also a down

333
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,500
closed candle prior to this runoff so

334
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,959
essentially it is a mitigation block

335
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,500
Breakers are mitigation by default

336
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,120
so

337
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,279
whether you identify that as a breaker

338
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,620
which is or if you just want to refer to

339
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,019
it as a mitigation block you'd be

340
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,120
correcting in either case

341
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,880
the high that candle is the monthly

342
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,820
bearish breaker High

343
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
and the low of that candle is the

344
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,440
monthly bearish breaker low

345
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,779
this candle is low

346
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,480
and this candle is high

347
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,120
makes the fair value Gap in the form of

348
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,459
a sibi South Side imbalance by side

349
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,680
inefficiency it means it's a down candle

350
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
that creates the fair Vega a very short

351
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,060
way of saying it

352
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,980
the market creates a fair value Gap here

353
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,839
in the form of a buy side of balance

354
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,459
outside inefficiency

355
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,880
this candle's High to this candle's low

356
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,800
the fair value Gap was formed with buy

357
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,019
side delivery in other words it's an up

358
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,760
closed candle that makes the fair value

359
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
Gap

360
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,680
this is something future

361
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,060
this is something that's already

362
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,500
happened

363
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,660
so over in The annotation section this

364
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,579
is something that I would

365
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,160
humbly submit and obviously I've seen

366
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
some of my students that are extremely

367
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
detail-oriented and they're absolutely

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,779
stunning in terms of how they annotate

369
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,699
their charts how they record their

370
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,920
observations just the just the overall

371
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,980
neatness and well-rounded presentation

372
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,620
of recording what it is they see in the

373
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,300
chart that's useful to them just a

374
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,880
beautiful illustration and approach to

375
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
doing it and many of them share by way

376
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
of Twitter

377
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,820
and

378
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,660
while I do believe that this part of

379
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,600
your journey should be kept private

380
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,300
you want to include over here some of

381
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,160
the personal things that

382
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,320
you want to include for that particular

383
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,180
time frame or that market

384
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,820
this is also why I teach

385
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,920
that you should only really be focusing

386
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,279
on specializing on one market

387
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,180
now you might have support behind the

388
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,220
very markets you're trading by using the

389
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,959
dollar index for instance and that that

390
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
serves you well whether it be an index

391
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
Trader like I'm showing an example of

392
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,000
here

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
or a Forex Trader

394
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,980
and or a commodity Trader because the

395
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,660
dollar Index is going to have a lot of

396
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,519
impact on all three of those types of

397
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,160
markets

398
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,360
but in your annotations for instance

399
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,560
I'll just read this out here

400
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,260
the NQ monthly journal entry

401
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,139
the NQ monthly continuous contract has

402
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,320
rallied strong from October 22.

403
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
blows right here

404
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
why did this Rally from here you can

405
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,839
include that traded down into this buy

406
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,980
Side imbalanced Sales sign and

407
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,019
efficiency which is a fair value Gap and

408
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,440
swept the sell side rate below that low

409
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
that's how much you can include you can

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,040
include all this in here

411
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,440
but for the sake of brevity

412
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,079
and also just to review and also show

413
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,880
you what might happen going into the

414
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,079
future from the time of this recording

415
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm only including what's

416
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,440
Salient right now

417
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,380
I was anticipating the down closed

418
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,040
candle on September of 2021 to provide

419
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,899
characteristics of a ICT bearish breaker

420
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,880
that's this candle I'm referring to

421
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,839
there

422
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,779
it was long overdue for a down close

423
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,779
monthly candle after five months of buy

424
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,240
side delivery and price that means all

425
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,820
of this movement here

426
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,339
so it's reasonable to anticipate at the

427
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,380
time of this recording it's August

428
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,179
2023

429
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,520
so we traded up five months being from

430
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,140
this down close candle so you have one

431
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,959
two three four five

432
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,179
and then in August because this is July

433
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,540
here August it's reasonable to

434
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,859
anticipate

435
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,559
August creating a down close candle it

436
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,919
does not need to close

437
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,119
lower

438
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,580
but we can anticipate the delivery of

439
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,440
price like this because we've had so

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,540
many up close candles

441
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,299
and we traded up into a breaker and we

442
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,940
fulfilled the redelivery to all this

443
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,919
down close candles range between this

444
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,360
candle's low and this candle is high

445
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,600
it's going lower right well inside that

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,820
shaded area we expect price to deliver

447
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,539
upside or buy side delivery not buy side

448
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,700
liquidity buy side delivery it means

449
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,880
this movement higher to overlap this

450
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,120
area over here when it painted lower you

451
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
want to see candles painted higher so

452
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,440
that gives us

453
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,120
a repricing

454
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,059
not necessarily

455
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,140
rebalanced yet

456
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,240
it has to leave this area on the lower

457
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
time frames

458
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
to be

459
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
rebalanced

460
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,400
so notice what I said here I said that I

461
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,860
was anticipating the down closed candle

462
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,200
on September 2021 to provide

463
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
characteristics of a ICT bearish breaker

464
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,760
now this statement was true for me

465
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,320
personally

466
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,559
but for you that might not be the case

467
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,360
referring that I can't you may not have

468
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,039
even referred to that candle at all in

469
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,320
your analysis you may not even notice

470
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,539
that or paid any mind to it

471
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,820
in your charts when you're back testing

472
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,039
and journaling you're going to be doing

473
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,140
this very thing here

474
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,880
you're going to be recording as if you

475
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
did you're going to use language like

476
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,660
this I was anticipating the down closed

477
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,000
candle on September 2021 to provide

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
characteristics of an ICT bearish

479
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,679
breaker what this is implying is

480
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,780
you felt when it reached up into this

481
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,660
area in here between these two heavy red

482
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,580
levels

483
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,980
that there would be some measure of a

484
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,740
draw to it and then where inside between

485
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,780
these two levels here the breaker low

486
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,179
and the breaker High where is their

487
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,679
liquidity well that would be right above

488
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
these highs here which are relatively

489
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,380
equal

490
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,900
any of the inefficiency in here

491
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,480
so is it required

492
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,980
for price to come all the way up to the

493
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,440
breaker High we don't want to see that

494
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,000
that's one of the rules about that

495
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,539
pattern or that very PD array

496
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,580
we don't want to see it trade to the

497
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,900
high it can

498
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,059
but we don't want to see that

499
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,660
so

500
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,100
in this range here we see the

501
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,960
inefficiency

502
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,059
and we trade it into the breaker this

503
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,740
down closed candle

504
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,260
and in your chart where you have spaces

505
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,419
where you at least have to Make spaces

506
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,700
in your chart so you have to scale your

507
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,360
time axis and your price access

508
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
to allow for you can annotate

509
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,100
now for me

510
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,419
this is enough to give you an example

511
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,299
but I want you to take away from this

512
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
the language I'm using here

513
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,880
I am very pleased to see price open near

514
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,700
the high of the present August 2023

515
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,940
monthly candle subsequent delivery of

516
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,280
lower price

517
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,980
the enqueue is showing respect of the

518
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,940
January 2022 fair value Gap sibi

519
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,700
which is located inside the range of the

520
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,419
ICT bearish breaker meaning that

521
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,340
I'm pleased that it's doing this very

522
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,080
thing this is a monthly candle for

523
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,039
August of 2023. it opened moved up just

524
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,840
a little bit it's barely very hard to

525
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,539
see but then it trades lower

526
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:58,620
after trading into and closing in the

527
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,559
month of July this fair value Gap sibi

528
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,299
that's what this is saying here and

529
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,000
notice what I'm using again the terms

530
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,760
that are very emotionally

531
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,260
positive

532
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
they're not

533
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,880
communicating confusion they're not

534
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
recording moments where you were

535
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
frustrated you're never recording

536
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,820
anything like that in your Journal

537
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,980
you're never doing that

538
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,820
do not use your journal to record scary

539
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,200
thoughts

540
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,659
don't record

541
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,480
periods of confusion or feeling like you

542
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,280
just don't know

543
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,860
you're cheerleading yourself and you're

544
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,039
annotating these charts as you do it

545
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,100
now for some of you that are male you're

546
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,299
going to have a problem with this right

547
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,500
away I know some of you are like this is

548
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,419
a waste of time especially if you're one

549
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,020
of the Macho type I ain't got time to

550
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,480
journal ICT I got money to make okay

551
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,559
that's fine

552
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,460
but the majority of you that want to do

553
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,919
this correctly will do these types of

554
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,640
things

555
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,700
and your brain is extremely powerful it

556
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,820
is the fastest it is the most powerful

557
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,120
computer that will ever exist because it

558
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,260
has a personality attached to it

559
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,000
a computer can only do what a computer

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,580
is programmed to do that's it it can

561
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,220
make calculations it can reason within

562
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,500
logic that it's supplied

563
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,120
but you

564
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
you can create

565
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,760
you can imagine you can regret

566
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,200
you can

567
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,960
feel good so you have an emotional

568
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,419
stimuli that's associated with your

569
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,580
previous learning experiences and your

570
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,740
future learning experiences so in your

571
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,659
Journal you want to filter out every

572
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,419
negative aspect that's not to say that

573
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,940
you can't observe things that you didn't

574
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,000
do correctly or that you felt

575
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
that you didn't see coming

576
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,140
always recorded like you did

577
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,179
if you had something that you did

578
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,679
incorrectly

579
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,200
okay if you have a moment in price

580
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
action where you know you were there

581
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,380
that day and you were literally looking

582
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,700
at price and you thought something was

583
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,740
going to happen a specific way

584
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,960
you want to record it in a way where it

585
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,640
sounds like this

586
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,740
this is a wonderful opportunity for me

587
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,380
to improve upon this area here because I

588
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,559
thought price would do XYZ or whatever

589
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,260
it would be that you're looking at that

590
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,940
you thought for instance maybe you

591
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,400
thought that in the morning session buy

592
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,960
side liquidity was going to be taken but

593
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,460
it never ran for buy side and went the

594
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,780
opposite direction

595
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,940
so in your Journal you could record

596
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,799
something like

597
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm grateful that I had the opportunity

598
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,940
to learn why that the sell side was

599
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,880
attacked over the buy side today

600
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,520
see what I just did there I disarmed

601
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
that pain and frustration that you

602
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,780
probably felt by watching real-time

603
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,700
price action

604
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,380
but didn't see it deliver like you

605
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,539
wanted it to but then you go in and you

606
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,220
annotate the chart

607
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,900
and I'm seeking hypothetically here as

608
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,220
an example because it's not being shown

609
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,720
here on this chart

610
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,700
but you want to be able to record it in

611
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,520
a way where it doesn't hurt you it

612
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,320
doesn't hurt you psychologically it

613
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,100
doesn't form a memory or um

614
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,799
a monument to a period of confusion you

615
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
don't ever want to do that

616
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
because if you do those types of things

617
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,679
and that's what many of you do with

618
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,240
social media you'll complain and say

619
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,120
this is hard this is too complicated I'm

620
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,720
never going to do this you know I'm I'm

621
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,980
struggling and I'm about to quit

622
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,200
whenever you do that you're doing the

623
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,419
opposite the Very extreme opposite of

624
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,700
what it is that you should be doing

625
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,640
your Journal is your best cheerleading

626
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,080
vehicle

627
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,740
and it's also a way for you to build the

628
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,720
most powerful trading money making

629
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,240
manual you'll ever have in your hands

630
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,700
and you wrote it yourself

631
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,640
so buying books is not the answer buying

632
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
courses is not the answer

633
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,380
trying to trade and follow me tick by

634
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,039
tick real time is not the answer this is

635
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,840
the answer this is the thing that you're

636
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,100
supposed to be doing this is the thing

637
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,380
that most of you

638
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,080
will not do long enough to be able to

639
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
get good at reading price action you

640
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,360
have to study old price action and you

641
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,860
have to sweet talk yourself into

642
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,080
believing that these things were

643
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,299
identified ahead of time by you

644
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,320
and you record it as such

645
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,740
and here I say if and Q Finds Its way

646
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,140
lower and below the ICT breaker low

647
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,380
there's a fair value Gap busy formed on

648
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,440
the June 2023 monthly candle that's this

649
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,299
candle right here

650
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,799
now

651
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,200
over here in this area you may include

652
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,320
other things that you were identifying

653
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,440
or saw something in here that you want

654
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,460
to make sure you record and build up

655
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,159
this scary area in your understanding

656
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,380
you longer term bias you know how long

657
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,200
you should I expect the bias to stay in

658
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,299
effect well if you've been bullish it's

659
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,980
reasonable to anticipate it's eating up

660
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,720
into this

661
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,659
bearish breaker and if it does how far

662
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,820
can it go buy sides here above these

663
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,080
highs and then you have the inefficiency

664
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,360
and you saw July delivered that and the

665
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,460
wick goes just past it by a little bit

666
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,100
but that's okay because the Wicks do the

667
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,120
damage

668
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,640
the candlesticks tell you the story

669
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,360
that's the narrative

670
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,419
now taking everything from that monthly

671
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,659
chart

672
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,679
transposing it down to the weekly chart

673
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
it's very easy to do that you just

674
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,480
toggle down to the weekly chart and

675
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
every annotation that you have as long

676
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,240
as each one of these annotations that

677
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,279
you did on your monthly chart are shown

678
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,760
on all intervals so the way you would do

679
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,500
that is you would hover over top of any

680
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,900
annotation then right click your

681
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,320
Mouse and then click interval or show

682
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,240
intervals all

683
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,919
on trading View and that way when every

684
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,600
time you drop down to a lower time frame

685
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
or any other time frame The annotation

686
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,080
you put on your hard time for your

687
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,520
monthly chart will show up on the lower

688
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,900
time frames all the way down to the

689
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,580
smallest one

690
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,179
so what I have here is those same

691
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,400
breaker High breaker low

692
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,880
and fair value gap on a monthly

693
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
so you want to annotate your higher time

694
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,740
frame PD arrays

695
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,840
with what time frame they are notice I

696
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,299
have the monthly Parish breaker High

697
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,480
monthly fair value Gap CB monthly

698
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,380
bearish breaker low

699
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,320
this is a premium Wick consequent

700
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,659
encroachment that means this Wick of

701
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,279
this candle here

702
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,700
it's half of that Wick we treat Wicks

703
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,640
and Tails on candlesticks like gaps

704
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,820
okay so every Gap has a equilibrium

705
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,080
price point

706
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,960
and it's not called mean threshold it's

707
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,179
not called equilibrium it's called

708
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,179
consequent encroachment so whenever we

709
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,200
have a gap like this box says here

710
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,700
that would have a consequent

711
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,220
encroachment as a midpoint

712
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,400
an order block which is like the breaker

713
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,419
high in the breaker low that was shown

714
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,539
on the monthly chart let me go back up

715
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,460
this candle here midpoint of that

716
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,380
because it's an order block midpoint is

717
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,840
mean threshold

718
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,960
middle or halfway point of a gap very

719
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,940
you got the halfway point would be

720
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,960
consequent encroachment

721
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,760
so now we're on a lower time frame

722
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,640
weekly chart so now we can start seeing

723
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
more detail this price action here on

724
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,039
this very particular candle we have a

725
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,080
wick

726
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
that Wick projected out in time

727
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,419
it is a premium Wick consequent

728
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,799
encroachment

729
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,360
now when we drop down the lower time

730
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,580
frames which will be the daily and

731
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,039
subsequent lower time frames

732
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,159
this would have to be annotated as what

733
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,460
what time frame is this

734
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,179
weekly

735
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,419
this is a bullish order block

736
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,460
propulsion block

737
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,260
why is this a propulsion block because

738
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,360
this down closed candle is your order

739
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,340
block and then you have a higher order

740
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,980
block down closed candle that does not

741
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,039
pass through mean threshold

742
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,860
not on a closing basis so we're seeing

743
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,200
it trade very close to that

744
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,899
opening price but it's inside of the

745
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,179
propulsion block which is the high of

746
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,960
the wick down to the opening

747
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,360
the propulsion block has a midpoint or

748
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,460
equilibrium price point which would be

749
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,360
what

750
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,820
Council encouragement

751
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,640
or mean threshold

752
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,799
mean threshold

753
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,720
so we want to see does price show

754
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,779
sensitivity there that's what I'm having

755
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,279
annotated so I want to see what we do

756
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,260
there we also have a fairway Gap there

757
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,820
you can annotate that I'm just

758
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,140
mentioning here because I want to keep

759
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,520
the chart cleaner

760
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,220
so because we have that Gap because we

761
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,779
have an order block and a propulsion

762
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,419
block we might have sensitivity there

763
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,100
this week coming up

764
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,659
so does that mean it's going to go here

765
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,880
and go higher I don't know does it mean

766
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,100
it goes to it and through it I don't

767
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,980
know that so we have to wait and see

768
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,140
how does it trade on Sunday into Monday

769
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,240
now that fair value Gap

770
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,340
was formed on the monthly chart so

771
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,659
that's why it's annotated here as

772
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,760
monthly fair value Gap by 7 balance

773
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,500
outside and efficiency when we get into

774
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,419
lower time frames this will be annotated

775
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,880
as a weekly bullish order block

776
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,100
propulsion block because it's framed and

777
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,380
built on what time frame

778
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,419
the weekly chart

779
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,059
so the annotations are as such

780
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,000
the NQ weekly journal entry

781
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
The enqueue Continuous weekly chart

782
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,620
respected the premium with consequent

783
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,419
encroachment on the weekly candle of

784
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,200
July 17 2023

785
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
that's this candle here that's the

786
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,100
consequent encrosion or the midpoint of

787
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,860
that Wick and we're seeing it respected

788
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,279
here so this is last week's trading it

789
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,860
opened traded up into it we Wicked

790
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,140
through took out the previous weekly

791
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,860
High

792
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,860
but the bodies are staying below the

793
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,679
consequent encouragement of that Wick

794
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,539
and then price delivered below the

795
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,059
previous week's low

796
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,700
over this fair value Gap and trading

797
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,700
into the propulsion block here

798
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,279
right there now it looks like on this

799
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,539
chart it looks like it's touching the

800
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,220
opening price but it doesn't yet

801
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,460
we were expecting to see NQ price drop

802
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,340
into the bullish order block propulsion

803
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,460
block on the weekly candle of July 3rd

804
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,460
2023.

805
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,200
right here

806
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,880
that's the propulsion block and we are

807
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,640
expecting this very thing to happen so

808
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,960
what am I doing here I'm teaching you

809
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,279
how to

810
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
record it as you saw it coming

811
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
and then you record it here

812
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,440
I was not overly concerned with the

813
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,260
initial rally higher in the first part

814
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,840
of the week of price action the bodies

815
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,760
of the candles tell The Narrative of

816
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,620
price action and again that's annotating

817
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,020
this very principle here it opened and

818
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,179
the initial rally up that was not

819
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:34,620
concerning

820
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,179
that was not going to be a thing that

821
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,000
tricked us that's not what tricked me we

822
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,039
are anticipating prices to go up just to

823
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,260
sucker in retail Traders

824
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,260
the lesson formed misinformed Street

825
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,760
money and then delivery lower

826
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,860
so now we have these annotations here

827
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,200
premium with console encouragement and

828
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
bullish order block propulsion block

829
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,399
when we drop down to the next time frame

830
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:00,600
which would be what

831
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,399
up here in the left hand corner what's

832
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
below the weekly chart

833
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
the daily so we'll have to make sure

834
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,899
these two PD arrays are labeled

835
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,340
weekly

836
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,500
so this will be a weekly premium WIC

837
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,480
consequent encouragement and weekly

838
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,840
bullish order block propulsion block

839
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,399
all right now we're down into the daily

840
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,820
chart okay so now we can see

841
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,380
the weekly bullish order block

842
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,440
propulsion block now has showing it as

843
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,179
weekly

844
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,580
and the weekly premium WIC consequent

845
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,580
encouragement notice how much all these

846
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,980
candles create a completely different

847
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,720
perspective

848
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,899
this is why by doing this you train your

849
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,179
eye and you start to see how the

850
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,679
different time frames

851
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,260
respect the higher time frame PD arrays

852
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,159
and you also never get lost in the story

853
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,960
and context of what price action is

854
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
showing you across all of the time

855
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,380
frames

856
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,240
so the

857
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,840
the price delivery Continuum which is

858
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,760
moving from higher time frame to lower

859
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,520
for lower to higher moving throughout

860
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
the pdra Matrix

861
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
every one of these annotations here

862
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,899
did not appear

863
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,719
on the weekly nor did they all appear on

864
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,099
the monthly

865
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,440
now we're on the daily chart so the

866
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,080
daily chart has its own specific PD

867
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,800
arrays but leaning on the logic and the

868
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,440
context that would be derived from those

869
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,540
PD arrays from the monthly chart and the

870
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,760
weekly chart now we're on the daily

871
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,780
chart

872
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,540
and again it's the same symbol NASDAQ

873
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,339
number one exclamation which is the

874
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,619
NASDAQ continuous contract

875
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,359
for those who have been wondering what

876
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,239
this means the continuous contract means

877
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,460
that whenever the front month or the

878
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,918
nearby contract is traded when it

879
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,580
expires this chart will use the data

880
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,240
from the new next nearby contract and it

881
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,520
will become the front month so for

882
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
instance right now we're trading the

883
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,740
September contract of NASDAQ

884
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,760
When nasdaq's September contract expires

885
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,800
this chart this NQ number one

886
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
exclamation will start using the data

887
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
from the December 2023 contract

888
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
so it's always using the front month or

889
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,760
new nearby contract expiration

890
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,119
it uses that data to make the the

891
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,800
individual candlesticks

892
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,339
if you're trading with

893
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,099
the actual Futures Contract you're not

894
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,200
trading with the NQ continuous contract

895
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,280
you're going to be trading with the

896
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,320
nearby contract so whichever one has the

897
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,700
most

898
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,980
open interest and highest volume

899
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,900
being traded most actively traded in

900
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,700
other words that's the one you're

901
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,740
actually going to be Trading

902
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,420
and you want to do this very thing here

903
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,000
with the actual contract now you're

904
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,619
probably asking why did I do it with the

905
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,960
set thermal contract because September's

906
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,520
contract on trading view is not going to

907
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,020
give you the data that shows you the

908
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,880
higher time frame monthly

909
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,859
so I'm using the continuous contract

910
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,320
here to show you that higher time frame

911
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,839
monthly fear value Gap city which is

912
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,880
this shaded area here

913
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
and then we have the daily chart showing

914
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
you another PD array which is this

915
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
imbalance here from this candle low that

916
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,260
candle is high so all of this down close

917
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,880
movement here

918
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,700
this sell side delivery not sell side

919
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,680
liquidity sell side delivery it means

920
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,320
the candlesticks expanding lower

921
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,160
this inefficiency is a daily fair value

922
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,940
Gap sibi cell side imbalance buy side

923
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,619
inefficiency

924
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,780
it traded up into the high of that

925
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,280
civvy

926
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,560
on Monday

927
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,140
then Tuesday we traded down got really

928
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,980
close to the low

929
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,599
which would be this candle's High

930
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,099
and then we opened here on Wednesday

931
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,839
traded higher

932
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,859
created a volume imbalance got lower

933
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,800
extreme price delivery on the low end so

934
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,960
all this sell side delivery

935
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,880
trades below

936
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,920
this low here where sell side liquidity

937
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,859
would be and dug into this sphere value

938
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:23,760
Gap

939
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,579
which is a fair value Gap busy buy side

940
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,700
imbalance sell side and efficiency

941
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,859
this is formed on the daily chart so the

942
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,560
annotations have to keep referencing

943
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,859
what time frame these PD eraser anchor

944
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,079
dorms that way when you go into lower

945
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,900
time frames you're not losing sight of

946
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,119
what levels are what

947
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,640
everything will be in its proper place

948
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,339
and everything will have the proper

949
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,560
context so if you're using the higher

950
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,380
time frame charts to determine

951
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,260
a narrative a bias where price is likely

952
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,359
to draw to you're going to use all these

953
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,980
PD arrays and right now let me just ask

954
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,300
you this if you were just looking at

955
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,859
this without me walking you through any

956
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,359
more of it it might be a little

957
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,640
overwhelming it might look a little

958
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
complicated but as we go through it

959
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,960
you're going to see oh now that makes

960
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,240
sense and when you do this in your own

961
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,140
charts and you do months of it not one

962
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,300
day a week where you try to cram it all

963
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,920
in one day if that's not what you should

964
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,720
be doing this should be a daily

965
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,500
meditation for you every single day is a

966
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,200
day that you must Journal

967
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,920
you actively do this every single day in

968
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,240
whatever Market that you want to

969
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,000
specialize in so this is why the folks

970
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,380
that are trying to be jack of all trades

971
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,020
and you you want to trade 28 markets and

972
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,700
have 28 markets being followed all the

973
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,440
time if you don't have a model that

974
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,119
you're consistent with you're wasting

975
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,619
your time

976
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,420
you're not doing things efficiently to

977
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,160
do what it is that you're trying to do

978
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,320
which is become very good at reading

979
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,880
price which will eventually by default

980
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,579
make you a better Trader

981
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,339
but you can't get there if you jump over

982
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,540
this part

983
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,420
I promise you if you're arm wrestling me

984
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,859
and saying I don't want to do this part

985
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm never going to do it ICT I'm never

986
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,160
going to journal I'm never going to do

987
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,859
this kind of stuff it's a waste of time

988
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:16,619
you will not be consistent you might get

989
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,020
once in a while lucky here and there

990
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,000
that you'll be either a break even

991
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,040
Trader or you'll eventually Crash and

992
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,900
Burn and you'll never tell anybody on

993
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,220
social media that happened

994
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,339
but you'll pretend that you didn't

995
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,500
don't waste your time

996
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,480
do these things I'm telling you to do

997
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,180
and I promise you the results the

998
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,520
understanding the logic behind the model

999
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,260
that you're seeking

1000
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,020
will literally leap off these charts and

1001
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,359
speak directly to you because the thing

1002
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,980
that you're gonna gravitate to the most

1003
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,680
whatever pdra it is you're going to see

1004
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,180
it and it's going to be the easiest one

1005
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,119
you see when you start doing this

1006
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,220
I'm not saying only annotate the one

1007
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,079
that you want to use for instance a fair

1008
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,420
value Gap or institutional order flow

1009
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,099
entry drill or it could be anything

1010
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,460
Don't force that always annotate

1011
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,740
everything after the fact

1012
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,619
use terminology in your commentary in

1013
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,619
your annotations like you saw it coming

1014
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:19,140
and over time by doing this every single

1015
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,460
trading day

1016
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,800
and yes it takes a little time

1017
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,020
yes it's going to feel tedious yes it's

1018
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,460
going to feel like this is

1019
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,440
counterintuitive and it's not productive

1020
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,440
but it really really is productive

1021
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,079
you are

1022
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,720
hot wiring

1023
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,480
your experience you're literally going

1024
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,660
in there and supercharging and

1025
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,339
shortening your learning curve

1026
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,140
it doesn't feel like it feels like

1027
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,820
you're doing everything opposite to what

1028
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,440
you should be doing you should be trying

1029
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,780
to trade the right side of the chart

1030
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,280
but how can you do that if you don't

1031
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,839
know what you're doing

1032
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,280
if you don't know what you're looking

1033
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,280
for how these things form where do they

1034
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,740
form what do they look like across all

1035
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,060
time frames

1036
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,460
you cannot do it

1037
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,280
you'll be wasting your time trying

1038
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,800
so it's important to anticipate that

1039
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,140
you're going to have months of doing

1040
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,420
this before you probably get really

1041
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,740
comfortable with what it is you're

1042
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,119
trying to do

1043
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,440
that doesn't mean you're trading

1044
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,480
consistently it just means that you're

1045
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,040
probably going to at that time months

1046
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,480
from now

1047
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,980
you're going to know what it is that you

1048
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,300
want to look for in price action because

1049
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,859
you've seen it repeat so many times it's

1050
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,119
obvious

1051
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,240
whichever PD area you like you'll know

1052
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,220
don't take the ones that I'm talking

1053
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,260
about the most it might be an obscure

1054
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,780
one like the mitigation block

1055
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,380
okay something that makes the most sense

1056
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,000
to you and all of my students are

1057
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,680
different they're all going to pick

1058
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,240
something that makes more sense to them

1059
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,040
then

1060
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,020
many times the nature style is going to

1061
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,320
be everybody wants to do order blocks

1062
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,119
but then to discover the fair value Gap

1063
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,300
then they discovered the model 2022.

1064
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,060
so and now we have a silver bullet set

1065
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,640
up which is time based so all these

1066
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,700
things okay they're

1067
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,339
potential candidates for you to build a

1068
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:12,720
model around

1069
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,060
that is Uniquely Yours

1070
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,940
but don't try to force it by doing this

1071
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,760
practice of annotating and logging with

1072
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,920
price action actually did and then

1073
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,960
recording the annotations

1074
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,780
properly and organized and then giving

1075
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,220
yourself annotations that were

1076
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,720
supportive

1077
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,380
saying well done to yourself for seeing

1078
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,720
it coming beforehand and then delivering

1079
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,579
what you thought it would

1080
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,859
you didn't probably do that

1081
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,420
but again you're tricking your

1082
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,400
subconscious and you're tricking

1083
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,280
yourself into believing by repetition

1084
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,900
looking at these old charts because

1085
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,300
these journal entries will be referred

1086
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,240
to later on at the end of the week at

1087
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,920
the end of the month look at previous

1088
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,140
week and the week before that you

1089
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,240
constantly go back and look at this over

1090
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,040
and over again

1091
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,319
it's like watching a movie you saw many

1092
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,180
times before you know what's going to be

1093
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,440
said you know what the actors are

1094
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,260
wearing you know the outcome but you're

1095
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,119
continuously watching it because why

1096
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,640
you'd like that movie I have dozens of

1097
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,700
them that I I like watching and I know

1098
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,380
the script I know the words are going to

1099
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,060
say I know the mannerism I even say it

1100
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,740
just the same way that they do sometimes

1101
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,599
and sometimes I'm in the shower and I'm

1102
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,060
repeating a movie scene because I'm

1103
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,859
looking forward to watching it again

1104
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,200
why because it means something to me it

1105
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,960
holds a special place in my heart that's

1106
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,240
what you're trying to do with price

1107
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,060
action you're falling in love with

1108
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,280
reading price and if you do not fall in

1109
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,079
love with this part of it or this aspect

1110
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,500
of what trading is you cannot absolutely

1111
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,040
underscore cannot be consistently

1112
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,160
long-term profitable that's it this is

1113
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,980
how you have a romance with price action

1114
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,079
you do this very thing you're writing

1115
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,079
love letters to your future self

1116
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,060
encouraging your future self and you're

1117
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,980
saying these are all the beautiful

1118
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,020
things I love about price action just

1119
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,339
like you want to be able to tell your

1120
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,380
your significant other you don't want to

1121
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,579
go up to your significant I want to say

1122
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,599
you know

1123
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,579
honey you got some really ugly hammer

1124
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:16,859
toes okay I don't know what's going on

1125
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,480
you got some toe jams we got we gotta

1126
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,859
take care of that you're never gonna do

1127
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:20,910
that not survive

1128
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,380
[Laughter]

1129
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,300
so you want to do what you want to say

1130
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,579
honey you look so nice today that's a

1131
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:27,960
lovely perfume you're wearing what did

1132
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,099
you do to your hair it looks beautiful

1133
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,140
today what are you doing you're focusing

1134
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,660
on all the positive because you know

1135
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,760
you don't want to go in a dog house you

1136
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,520
don't want to be separated from the the

1137
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,540
good aspects of being in that

1138
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,220
relationship with that person because

1139
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,480
you're going to say something that's

1140
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,520
negative you don't want to do that in

1141
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,839
your Journal because what you're doing

1142
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,940
is you're trying to cultivate the

1143
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,460
sweetest romance between you and price

1144
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,540
action

1145
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,880
you want to have a close-knit

1146
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,400
relationship with price

1147
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,319
you want to be able to warm up the price

1148
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,460
real quick

1149
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,260
see it when it starts trading real time

1150
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,579
so oh yeah I know what you're doing

1151
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,160
honey you do this all the time just like

1152
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,119
when you're with a long-term

1153
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,980
relationship partner you know what

1154
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,599
they're going to do how they wake up how

1155
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,980
they act before they have their coffee

1156
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,020
you know how they act before they go to

1157
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,520
bed you're either a night person or

1158
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,020
they're a morning person you know their

1159
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,660
little personal little quirky things

1160
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,359
this is how you learn what price does in

1161
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,060
its own unique personal quirky things

1162
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,339
and then that relationship and that

1163
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,859
language that love language between you

1164
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,420
and price action

1165
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,060
then it develops into what a long-term

1166
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,520
committed relationship which is positive

1167
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,240
profitability consistency longevity all

1168
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,400
those things and you don't have drama

1169
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,800
you don't want to invite drama into your

1170
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,720
relationship with price action

1171
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,300
so you start it as a love story you

1172
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,400
sweet talk it you sweet talk yourself

1173
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,859
your future self all this is what you're

1174
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:56,160
doing by back testing that is back

1175
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,400
testing that's my way of conditioning

1176
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,220
you as a student to go in and fall in

1177
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,619
love with what price does because it

1178
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,200
does these things over and over and over

1179
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,180
again just like your spouse your

1180
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,920
significant other would know things that

1181
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,480
you do all the time they know you're

1182
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,640
like a well-read book they know you like

1183
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,800
the back of their hand the same way you

1184
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
know them so

1185
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,420
by looking at the monthly chart and the

1186
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,920
weekly chart and having those respective

1187
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,520
PD arrays annotated on the daily chart

1188
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,079
then we look at the daily chart and

1189
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
identify what that time frame offers us

1190
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,200
so we have a complete and comprehensive

1191
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,819
approach from the highest time frames

1192
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:38,400
which is monthly weekly and now daily

1193
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,920
and every specific

1194
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,400
PD array must be properly labeled

1195
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,980
otherwise you will lose sight of what it

1196
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,380
is you're looking at

1197
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,060
this range up here

1198
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,240
is that fair value Gap CB on the monthly

1199
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,720
chart that was below the monthly breaker

1200
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,040
High

1201
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,800
and between that and the monthly breaker

1202
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,760
low which is this level here

1203
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,280
this daily fair value Gap in the form of

1204
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,800
a busy which is an up close candle

1205
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,339
this is only seen on the daily chart and

1206
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,980
this is that monthly

1207
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,300
fair value sales on efficiency

1208
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,000
we have a sibi here

1209
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,760
so it's a daily fair value Gap sibi the

1210
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,280
candle was down down candles that make a

1211
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,440
fair value Gap is a city

1212
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,780
up close candles that make a fairway Gap

1213
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,339
is a busy

1214
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,220
Okay so

1215
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,359
this inefficiency here

1216
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,660
forms it what part of this monthly fair

1217
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,520
value Gap City so in other words between

1218
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,280
this Range High and this range low from

1219
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,319
the monthly chart now

1220
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,880
where is this

1221
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,440
sibi forming

1222
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,599
in the lower half of it

1223
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,300
did you notice that

1224
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,040
hi

1225
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,500
to low that pink Range

1226
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,260
halfway points about right here

1227
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,619
so the high of that City also is in

1228
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,140
close proximity to the consequent

1229
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,780
encroachment which is not labeled here

1230
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,240
of the high and low you might want to

1231
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,700
include that in your chart

1232
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,920
but this sibi stops right there because

1233
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,260
not only is it the high of this

1234
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,599
imbalance but it's also consequent

1235
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,040
encroachment of the monthly fair value

1236
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,540
Gap City

1237
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,060
so now notice what we're doing we're

1238
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,200
observing

1239
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,660
we're appreciating and recording

1240
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,380
the logic behind nested PD arrays

1241
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,680
there's a convergence if you will of PD

1242
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,020
arrays and levels that would otherwise

1243
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,599
go unnoticed by you or anyone else out

1244
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,940
there and these are the types of things

1245
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,220
that I have done in the past years ago

1246
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,619
when I would do recorded executions and

1247
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,660
people would say you know why is he

1248
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,700
trading there like what what's so

1249
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,280
significant about that area it's things

1250
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,660
like this

1251
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,599
and I can say it in passing say hey look

1252
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,700
you know it's it's a monthly fair value

1253
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,040
Gap and check your charts for homework

1254
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,180
you want to look at the monthly chart

1255
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,880
there's a uh in inefficiency around that

1256
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,800
price level but see you don't want to do

1257
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,720
that you just want to watch me do a new

1258
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,000
trick you want to see me do some new

1259
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,520
teaching and not dig into the charts

1260
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,260
yourself and appreciate what it is I'm

1261
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,520
laying out there for you on a silver

1262
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,319
platter but I'm not going to spell it

1263
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,880
out for you not because I don't want you

1264
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,839
to learn it because I want you to go

1265
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,160
into the charts and do this very thing

1266
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,119
here

1267
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,040
which is what every one of my profitable

1268
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,200
students are doing and have done

1269
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,940
you're not going to be the exception

1270
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,900
stop arm wrestling it

1271
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,140
so we also have this area here

1272
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,500
which is a what fair value yeah

1273
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,240
but

1274
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,859
think now

1275
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,560
if this is an inefficiency and it's a

1276
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,599
fair value Gap what kind of fair value

1277
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,980
Gap is this

1278
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,900
buy sell and balance sell sign

1279
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,700
inefficiency just like this one is down

1280
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,540
here

1281
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,400
but what does this become if this area

1282
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,319
up here is creating some measure of

1283
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,380
unlikely price delivery going lower

1284
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,660
and then we see support behind that idea

1285
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,359
where price does this very thing here

1286
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,460
as soon as this candle trades down below

1287
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,000
these lows and below this candle's High

1288
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,760
which is the low of this by side of

1289
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,440
balance cell sign efficiency which is a

1290
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,200
fair value Gap this pass through this

1291
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,920
candle here makes this

1292
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,940
and this

1293
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,040
a potential what

1294
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,220
inversion fair value Gap what what time

1295
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,440
frame does it form on the daily chart

1296
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,660
see we're up here daily

1297
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,940
so your annotation here is the daily

1298
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,980
inversion fair value Gap High which is

1299
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,839
this candle is low

1300
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,760
and this candle is high which is the

1301
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,420
daily inversion fair value got low

1302
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,260
an inversion fair value Gap is narrative

1303
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,119
based

1304
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,099
if we take away the context of it

1305
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,900
wanting to go lower

1306
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,180
prior to this lower this is just simply

1307
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,040
a fairway Gap by Center balance also

1308
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,200
inefficiency but as soon as we have

1309
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,020
price deliver to the sell side

1310
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,240
and then attack cell side liquidity and

1311
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,680
Pierce the low end range of that bison

1312
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,020
efficiency this sets the tone if

1313
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,240
narrative is considered and we've

1314
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,460
already established that early on that

1315
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,800
we were looking for lower prices

1316
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,900
so that means we can use

1317
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,680
the midpoint or the low or the lower

1318
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,119
quadrant

1319
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,980
notice there's three specific levels

1320
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,260
there not a Zone

1321
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,960
very specific price levels

1322
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,119
midpoint well what's the midpoint of an

1323
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,920
insertion of a gap

1324
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,960
the same thing that we would call the

1325
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,760
middle of a fair value Gap the same

1326
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,740
thing we would call the middle of a wick

1327
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,059
or a tail

1328
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,859
consequent encroachment

1329
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,140
so we see the daily inversion fair value

1330
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,660
got consequent encroachment is right

1331
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,460
there

1332
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,180
notice we have this inefficiency here

1333
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,780
which is what daily fair value Gap sippy

1334
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,220
so

1335
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,500
anyone else watching my videos if they

1336
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,119
don't really go through the process of

1337
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,740
doing this or learning or take good

1338
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,240
notes

1339
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,380
they're going to assume that the

1340
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,640
Market's going to go all the way back

1341
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,920
out to here because they'll say this is

1342
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,480
a liquidity void and the Market's going

1343
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,040
to want to have to go up there not when

1344
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,480
it's like this

1345
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,220
like what

1346
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,559
we have a higher time frame monthly fear

1347
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,700
Vega

1348
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,460
we went up and repriced to it we went up

1349
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,319
to it one more time halfway consequent

1350
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,200
encroachment and we also rebalanced this

1351
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,760
area here because we went up into

1352
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,160
repricing it and then we left the range

1353
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,260
there so now this is a balanced price

1354
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,460
range

1355
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,460
and we had one two premium arrays

1356
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,400
supporting what lower prices so as soon

1357
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,940
as we pierced through this low here

1358
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,940
this level here not that very candle

1359
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,559
this

1360
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,319
low of the inversion fair value got we

1361
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,640
don't know it's an inversion fair value

1362
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,940
Gap until price does this pass through

1363
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,700
then we can anticipate the market likely

1364
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,160
to reach up into the midpoint between

1365
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,200
this candles

1366
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,260
below and this candle's high and that

1367
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,300
midpoint is daily inversion fairy value

1368
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,640
got consequent encroachment

1369
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,440
said midpoint between this level here

1370
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,960
and this level there

1371
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,119
we trade up to here

1372
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,819
trade lower and close there next candle

1373
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:40,920
we open trade up one more time trading

1374
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,720
above the previous day's High

1375
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,819
trading up into consequent encroachment

1376
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,040
of the inversion fair value Gap

1377
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,160
and what is this candle here

1378
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,280
this big beefy candle

1379
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,020
this is for the folks that like to say

1380
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,700
my order blocks are engulfing candles

1381
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,680
that's nothing to do with it this candle

1382
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,760
here

1383
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,700
is the bearish order block

1384
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,819
notice this camera does not Pierce or

1385
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:12,599
engulf this previous candle whoops there

1386
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,180
goes that logic so it's the change in

1387
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,319
the state of delivery which is the

1388
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,520
opening price here as soon as that

1389
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,319
opening price is pierced to the downside

1390
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,839
right there on that candle this becomes

1391
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,880
a bearish order block

1392
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,859
now because this is an order block we

1393
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,720
can take that range from the low to the

1394
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,720
high halfway point of that is what

1395
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,319
consequent encroachment no mean

1396
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,980
threshold so we extend that to the

1397
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,160
Future and it would be in this area here

1398
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,559
but we have what what do we have here we

1399
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,119
have this inefficiency from this

1400
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,700
candle's low this candle is high

1401
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,300
would we reasonably expect if we have

1402
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,099
the inversion fair value Gap consequent

1403
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:54,660
encroachment which is

1404
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,460
half of this

1405
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,099
by Center balance outside efficiency

1406
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,500
the main point of that if we have that

1407
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,020
and we have the opening of this bearish

1408
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,280
order block and

1409
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,740
potential institutional order flow entry

1410
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,520
drill

1411
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,400
we're expecting lower prices and we have

1412
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,800
an inversion fair value Gap can it go

1413
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,000
back up to the inversion favorite value

1414
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,819
get high yes the chances of it doing

1415
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,099
that are Slim

1416
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,859
by far and large many times you're going

1417
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:27,420
to see that inversion Fair rate gaps

1418
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,119
given this type of movement where we've

1419
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,240
moved about five months One Direction we

1420
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,280
hit a premium array there's no reason

1421
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,960
really to go up to the high of the

1422
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,400
breaker and because the breaker is

1423
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,839
essentially a pattern that you want to

1424
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,839
trade the low or mean threshold of

1425
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,700
you don't want to see it trade the the

1426
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,500
high end if it does it becomes a little

1427
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,579
less

1428
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,980
likely doesn't mean it can't go there it

1429
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,680
just means that I don't like to see that

1430
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,079
and if it does that and I'm in a trade I

1431
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,260
will scale something off to remove the

1432
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,660
measure of risk that I'm holding if I

1433
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,099
see it trading through the high of the

1434
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,720
breaker

1435
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,119
because if it trades the high of the

1436
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,579
breaker it means that it's not as

1437
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,220
bearish as I want it to be

1438
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,720
and you don't want to see it trade up

1439
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,280
here if it's bearish it shouldn't get

1440
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,559
all the way up there same aspect that's

1441
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,220
being shown here if we have this

1442
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,099
City from this candle's low and this

1443
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:24,359
candle is high

1444
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,099
and we have this one big camel trade

1445
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,740
down like that do we really want to see

1446
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,059
it trade above

1447
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,160
the daily inversion for everybody got

1448
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,300
high

1449
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,180
no we don't want to see that just like

1450
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,440
we wouldn't want to see it trade on the

1451
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,900
monthly bearish breaker High because if

1452
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,000
it's bearish we want to see premium

1453
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,660
arrays not be reached to

1454
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,520
let me say that again

1455
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,619
if we're bearish

1456
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:53,220
if we see premium arrays in our pdra

1457
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,500
Matrix in the the fractal that we're

1458
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,880
studying in price action that means all

1459
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,920
the data that's being shown here

1460
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,319
if we can clearly identify

1461
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:04,980
where specific liquidity resides or

1462
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,500
where a premium PD array

1463
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,960
is in price if we're really really

1464
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,660
bearish we do not want to see premium

1465
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,880
arrays traded to we want to see discount

1466
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,760
arrays draw price to it

1467
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,780
and everything smashed through down

1468
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,520
closed candles

1469
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,680
because what is that telling us order

1470
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,300
flow is bearish

1471
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,579
did I have to show you a Dom for that a

1472
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,819
depth of Market that I have to show you

1473
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:34,500
a v-wop

1474
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,319
did you have to see a

1475
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,240
component control

1476
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,099
how about a volume profile

1477
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,599
did you have to look at volume for that

1478
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,760
no

1479
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,220
everything is in the candlestick

1480
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,300
everything

1481
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,859
you just need to know what it is you're

1482
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:52,380
looking at by time

1483
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,500
so we also have the weekly premium WIC

1484
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,420
consequent encouragement which was being

1485
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,920
respected look at the bodies right there

1486
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,119
see that

1487
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:01,980
did any of the bodies cross over that

1488
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,920
nope but we did have Wix go through it

1489
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,980
and that also teaches you what

1490
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,800
by annotating your chart like this and

1491
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,540
seeing how the lower time frames go

1492
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,400
through it just a little bit but when it

1493
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,440
does that and if you're bearish you're

1494
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,000
going to start to condition yourself and

1495
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,440
say okay

1496
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,960
this is acceptable this is why I say

1497
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,819
this is permissible in price action

1498
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:26,520
where you might get scared out of it or

1499
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,200
you might put your stop loss just above

1500
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,119
that thinking that it's enough it's not

1501
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,460
enough

1502
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,500
but I'm not scared or changing my

1503
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,579
opinion about where the Market's going

1504
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,040
to go because there might be a small

1505
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,859
little mohawk little deviation outside

1506
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:42,900
of the levels I'm looking for this is

1507
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,660
all normal coloring Outside the Lines

1508
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,740
okay

1509
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,720
this algorithm is my baby it's my child

1510
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,020
so when I look at Price action and it

1511
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,180
colors outside the lines I'm still going

1512
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,559
to take this chart and hang it on my

1513
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,900
refrigerator hanging on my desk okay

1514
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,660
it's it's something my child has done

1515
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,940
and I know that this is my child's

1516
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,640
fingerprints so I don't worry about

1517
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,099
these things when I'm looking at it and

1518
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:10,799
I'm not judgmental what price did in

1519
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,380
these areas when it's normal to see that

1520
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,980
very thing and you won't grow anxious

1521
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
when you're studying price and it's

1522
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,160
behaving this way because it's something

1523
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,460
that you expect and it's likely to occur

1524
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,680
where everyone else might get scared or

1525
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,780
stopped out or they may even change

1526
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,220
their opinion about where they think the

1527
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,780
Mark's going to go because the market

1528
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,640
creates these little wicks

1529
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,760
at the real at the time watching it this

1530
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,000
is a full-blown bullish green candle

1531
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,400
at the highest high of that you know

1532
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,240
when it touches the candle low there

1533
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,119
real time I'm expecting it to just bump

1534
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,799
just above it a little bit and then

1535
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,680
recede back into the range

1536
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,839
when you start doing these types of

1537
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:57,540
annotations it conditions you to

1538
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,980
anticipate that very thing so when you

1539
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,900
were watching real-time price action or

1540
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,339
tape reading

1541
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,319
you will have that in your mind because

1542
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,720
you've seen many examples of it

1543
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,220
and then when you start getting real

1544
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,260
comfortable with it and it happens to do

1545
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,720
this that very thing it feels really

1546
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,000
good it's a confidence Builder it's not

1547
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,099
an overconfidence Creator it's a

1548
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,680
confidence Builder and it builds this

1549
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,359
understanding about price action that

1550
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,400
you would never otherwise get unless you

1551
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,599
were actually doing these types of

1552
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,220
things and recording it and showing

1553
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,220
snapshots over time not just I did it

1554
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,839
for a two weeks ICT I'm done back

1555
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,940
testing then you're not

1556
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,619
in German is something you're going to

1557
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:36,780
do the rest of your career you want to

1558
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,640
be able to imitate and log everything

1559
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,740
and the more you pour into this part of

1560
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,920
it the better you're going to be

1561
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,900
so we wouldn't want to see this area up

1562
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,780
here in this city be traded to

1563
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,000
we don't want to see that because above

1564
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,819
the daily inverse repair by Gap High

1565
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,200
we have this separation from this

1566
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,440
candle's low in the high which is this

1567
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,819
Candlestick load that's the inversion

1568
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,099
Fairbank app high and right away if this

1569
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:03,119
is one of the first times you ever

1570
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,859
watched one of my videos this isn't

1571
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:07,619
where you start okay this is for people

1572
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,359
that have been with me for a while and

1573
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,359
they just want to know how to journal so

1574
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:14,280
before you even get to this part you got

1575
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,900
to watch some videos okay there's a lot

1576
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,579
of things you need to look at and then

1577
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,200
if the first time you watch the video

1578
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,059
watch my 2022

1579
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,119
mentorship 41 videos okay just watch

1580
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,180
that one and it'll give you some context

1581
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,099
but then the Market opens here on

1582
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,799
Wednesday we open rally up

1583
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:35,420
and then Crush

1584
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,280
the sell side liquidity

1585
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,260
and we go below the low the daily

1586
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,059
inversion pair that you got that makes

1587
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,760
this low a real

1588
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,059
low of an inversion wherever you got

1589
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:50,460
Market trades the next day on Thursday

1590
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,000
opens rallies up touches

1591
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,460
the low of this candle here

1592
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,040
which is what that's your bearish order

1593
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,559
block it can trade to that level and up

1594
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,720
to the opening price

1595
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,940
can it just stop and dead in its tracks

1596
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,420
yeah but what do we allow for

1597
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,400
coloring Outside the Lines

1598
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,960
so that opening price extended forward

1599
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,819
what are we seeing right here

1600
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:16,920
the same element of price delivery

1601
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,079
that's going on right there

1602
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,280
this is a mohawk this is a mohawk it's

1603
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,940
absolutely permissible why because the

1604
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,920
market dynamics and the underpinnings of

1605
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,720
the marketplace is it's wanting to go

1606
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,579
lower

1607
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,040
so it's the one to go lower likely to go

1608
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,000
lower anytime it goes to a premium array

1609
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,140
that does touch

1610
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,900
it does deliver to anticipate a little

1611
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,579
bit of coloring outside the lines and

1612
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,740
not freak out thinking it's going to

1613
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,559
give way which is the reason why I have

1614
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:52,619
a roll of three PD arrays

1615
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,660
one the first one

1616
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,460
it can do this and then that's all there

1617
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,380
is it can do this and then trade into

1618
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,299
the second PD array that I would be

1619
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,460
viewing as a defense

1620
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,619
but if I have three PD arrays if I'm

1621
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,960
bearish if it trades through three PD

1622
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,180
arrays I'm probably wrong

1623
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,099
and if I haven't been stopped out

1624
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:12,660
I'm going to take the trade off and

1625
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,540
remove myself from risk

1626
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,880
many times and you watch me recently

1627
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,700
trade a live account live trade in the

1628
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,880
NQ or Nasdaq real Futures Contract not a

1629
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,579
demo you can see that over there on my

1630
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:29,059
Twitter account

1631
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,160
I was in a trade and I had one PD array

1632
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,480
of the three

1633
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,920
breached

1634
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,599
and it was approaching the second one

1635
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,660
and my third one was so close

1636
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,359
and right above my second PD array that

1637
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,799
if it went to my second one I was going

1638
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:45,420
to collapse the trade entirely and

1639
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,579
remove myself from risk

1640
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,619
so it's a matter of knowing all these

1641
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,540
things that you just can't get from an

1642
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,599
ICT video one time

1643
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,579
there's no way to compress and put all

1644
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,559
this bandwidth into one single

1645
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,660
individual presentation

1646
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,819
not not and had the Precision that you

1647
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,619
see me sharing and what my students are

1648
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:07,559
able to utilize on their trading

1649
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:09,359
so this area up here becomes what

1650
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,359
between the daily inversion fair value

1651
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,540
Gap High which is this candle's low

1652
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,000
so this candle is low here that makes

1653
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,140
this what

1654
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,440
a breakaway Gap

1655
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,359
it's not annotated right it's for you to

1656
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:26,220
go in and dig into it

1657
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,040
so we see it trade up into the bearish

1658
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,480
order block

1659
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,160
opening price

1660
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,780
And Trades about this candle is high

1661
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,299
rate there on Friday which is a

1662
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:38,119
institutional order flow entry drill

1663
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:43,200
what is that it is a entry taken that

1664
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,420
would be inside of a imbalance like a

1665
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,359
fair value Gap what is this it's a

1666
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:49,680
favorite I got

1667
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,799
shaded it's a daily survey Gap what kind

1668
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,180
City

1669
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,740
that means it's a down candle that

1670
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,140
delivers the fair Vega

1671
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,500
just the opposite of what a busy is okay

1672
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,000
obviously is a fairway Gap that has an

1673
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,839
up close candle

1674
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,920
civi

1675
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,740
what you remember easy is civi is sell

1676
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,780
side delivery sell off

1677
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,099
busy buy side delivery buy up

1678
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:22,980
okay that's the way you can remember it

1679
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,260
we don't want to see this area traded to

1680
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,380
because why we have this High here that

1681
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,000
you could trade to and create a turtle

1682
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,140
soup

1683
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,119
trade up above it and reject good alert

1684
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,099
which is what it did but how far can it

1685
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,780
go about that ICT

1686
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,119
opening price here this is your bearish

1687
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,260
order block that should change

1688
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,059
Interstate delivery rate there and it

1689
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:43,980
can go up to that area there and go

1690
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,960
through it just a little bit

1691
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,359
it's permissible price action

1692
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:50,099
coloring Outside the Lines

1693
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,740
and then we see delivery aggressive

1694
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,380
throughout the day and going lower

1695
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,540
taking out Thursday's low

1696
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,359
digging deeper into this box out of

1697
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,040
balance inefficiency

1698
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,680
right there

1699
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,880
and it's a daily based PD array

1700
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,880
the next one is the weekly bullish order

1701
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,440
block propulsion block you can see now

1702
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,119
now that we're on a daily chart it

1703
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,280
didn't quite get there yet that would be

1704
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,339
my next assumption for you know if it

1705
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,960
goes lower and then obviously the entire

1706
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,780
closure and delivery back to this candle

1707
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,079
is high

1708
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,520
it doesn't need to do that we've done

1709
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,980
enough trading into this Python and

1710
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,359
balance cell certain efficiency the

1711
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,359
close here is real close to

1712
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,339
consequent encroachment which is not

1713
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:40,020
annotated here but I want you to

1714
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,400
annotate that on your charts and look at

1715
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,319
in the lower time frames on the

1716
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,000
Thursday's price action and Friday of

1717
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,280
last week now with all that said the

1718
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,920
annotations I have over here is that the

1719
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,660
enqueue continuous daily contract

1720
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,299
delivered the lower prices I expected

1721
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:57,359
from the monthly fair value Gap sibi the

1722
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,480
weekly profile now when I say profile I

1723
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,920
do not use Market profile I do not use

1724
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,240
volume turned sideways plotted on my

1725
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,119
charts I don't do that okay I don't use

1726
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:14,339
depth of Market I don't use v-wop I

1727
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:16,140
don't use any of that kind of stuff to

1728
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,119
me they're gimmicks if you believe in

1729
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:19,680
them that's your religion I Ain't Gonna

1730
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,599
Knock you for your religion but it has

1731
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,039
nothing to do with why price goes up or

1732
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,240
down

1733
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,299
weekly profiles to me are like templates

1734
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:30,180
what is the roadmap that price is likely

1735
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,140
to follow

1736
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,359
this weekly profile was an obvious

1737
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,880
Monday high of the week bearish profile

1738
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,160
that formed immediately after the daily

1739
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,680
fair value Gap sibi was redelivered to

1740
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,200
on the Monday price action that means

1741
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,599
here's Monday's price action here we

1742
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,359
opened traded down rallied up to the

1743
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:49,859
high which is the low of this candle

1744
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,140
this is that City the fair value got

1745
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,539
civi it goes up here delivers it to a

1746
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:56,880
Monday and stops trading right there

1747
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,680
then on Tuesday we opened trade up a

1748
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,819
little bit and then slam lower

1749
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,140
the weekly profile was an obvious Monday

1750
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,140
high of the week bearish profile that

1751
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,900
formed immediately after the daily fair

1752
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,420
value Gap sibi was redelivered to on the

1753
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,580
Monday price action see what language

1754
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,140
I'm using there

1755
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,380
the weekly profile was an obvious Monday

1756
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,299
high of the week now I knew the

1757
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:26,000
likelihood of it forming on Mondays high

1758
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,460
but you may not have but in

1759
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,319
your annotations you want to record it

1760
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,839
like you were anticipating it

1761
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,719
going further Wednesday proved my

1762
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,580
bearish bias on the week was absolutely

1763
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,819
correct by creating a lower gap opening

1764
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:44,520
that's this here you opened here traded

1765
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,399
up you've got from the previous day

1766
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,939
we got and then the large range okay in

1767
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:53,160
the lower this led to an amazing large

1768
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,640
range down close day for NQ

1769
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,960
the daily range on the Wednesday

1770
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,600
extended past the inversion fair value

1771
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,060
got low which telegraphed the high

1772
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,040
probability of repricing to the

1773
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,660
inversion fair value got consequent

1774
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,359
encroachment before repricing lower on

1775
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,979
Friday's price action

1776
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,380
that's saying this candle went below

1777
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,238
this candle's High which is this

1778
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,460
inefficiency so this inefficiency was a

1779
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,259
fair value Gap

1780
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:21,540
we went through it here that makes this

1781
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,460
potentially a inversion Fair Vega

1782
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,020
meaning that it has a lot of probability

1783
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,520
that's going to go up to the midpoint of

1784
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,660
it

1785
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,698
why shouldn't it good that are high I

1786
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,859
just spent time talking about it this

1787
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,479
area up here we want to see that stay

1788
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,460
open as a fair value Gap

1789
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,779
no as a breakaway cap

1790
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,880
and then Friday we see it open trades up

1791
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,899
in here and then slams it back down

1792
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:48,120
Friday wasn't easy short selling day

1793
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,219
with the bearish institutional order

1794
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,738
flow entry drill and bearish Order block

1795
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:55,080
inside of the inversion fair value Gap

1796
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,480
and using the inversion fair value Gap

1797
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,280
consequent encroachment as the ideal

1798
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,199
premium PD array to expect the higher

1799
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,719
the data form on now

1800
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:05,760
this is again recording it on the

1801
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,360
context of

1802
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,980
disrespecting the fact that it's not

1803
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,739
from payroll Friday

1804
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:15,719
somewhere in here you want to record

1805
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,340
that this was non-farm payroll Friday

1806
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,380
that you wouldn't be trading that day

1807
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,500
necessarily as a new student but you can

1808
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,840
still see and repeat appreciate the the

1809
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,060
price action and delivery of that

1810
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,980
occurring

1811
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,420
[Music]

1812
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,440
moving on to the NASDAQ four hour

1813
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,239
you can see again all the annotations

1814
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,280
that were on the monthly the weekly and

1815
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,540
now the daily

1816
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,360
say the daily fair value Gap City

1817
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,980
daily inversion for everybody got high

1818
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,659
daily inversion favorite consequent

1819
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,000
encouragement and daily inversion fair

1820
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,320
value Gap below

1821
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,260
daily institutional order flow integral

1822
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,600
daily bearish order block daily fair

1823
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,060
value Cap City and now we have elements

1824
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,159
inside of the four hour chart like we

1825
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,140
see here the four hour bearish order

1826
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,600
block over here

1827
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,179
change in state deliveries there Market

1828
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:08,520
opens on this four hour chart trades up

1829
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,920
what's it doing it's trading just above

1830
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,440
that candlestick's opening price this is

1831
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,300
permissible price action this is a

1832
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,580
mohawk okay it's just a little bit

1833
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,500
outside the lines that's absolutely

1834
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,640
permissible

1835
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,860
the market trades there lower

1836
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,320
opens here and moves lower again this

1837
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,780
area in here

1838
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,540
is indicating that inside of this daily

1839
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,820
fair value Gap sibi

1840
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,679
there's a little bit more detail as to

1841
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,260
why we would not reasonably expect

1842
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,900
the daily chart to see price action go

1843
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,060
above that daily inversion variable you

1844
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,760
got Pi y look closer

1845
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,550
from this candlestick's low

1846
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,440
[Music]

1847
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,540
to this candlesticks High

1848
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,880
that is your

1849
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,480
daily

1850
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,980
this is the daily inversion fair value

1851
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,080
Gap High the midpoint of that inversion

1852
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,159
variable you got which Costco

1853
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,719
encroachment and the low of the daily

1854
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,360
inversion fair value got below

1855
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,520
so here's consequent encroachment

1856
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,860
why did we not expected to trade up in

1857
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,300
this area here on the daily it was

1858
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,239
showing in one single pass

1859
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,159
but on a four hour chart you can see it

1860
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,420
went down

1861
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,980
and then the next candle we opened and

1862
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,280
went back up there again and then down

1863
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,739
damn

1864
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,380
delivery in here as well so what is

1865
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,300
happening here went lower

1866
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,820
lower

1867
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,560
back up lower

1868
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,659
so this is what

1869
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,820
balanced so this is a balanced price

1870
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,080
range

1871
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,920
so what do we have from the daily

1872
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,679
inversion Fairbank app High to the Daily

1873
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:54,659
inversion fair value Gap consequent

1874
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:57,000
encroachment we have a balanced price

1875
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,420
range

1876
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,020
nailing the bearish order block opening

1877
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,120
price

1878
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,580
coupling it with

1879
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,679
a Confluence of the daily inversion for

1880
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:13,800
everybody got consequent encroachment

1881
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,239
of that

1882
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:17,880
gap on the daily chart that we saw trade

1883
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,219
through it here and then we expect the

1884
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:22,380
midpoint of that to act as what the high

1885
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,360
on Friday

1886
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,280
it's not likely to go all the way

1887
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,380
through all this just to get back up

1888
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,600
into a little area here let me go back

1889
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,980
up to the deal chart think about this

1890
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,199
little area right here

1891
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,880
okay now I'm going to show you that on a

1892
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,080
daily chart

1893
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,080
that's this little area right there

1894
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,760
go on your own charts and you'll see

1895
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,140
what I'm talking about

1896
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,000
this little area here is not likely to

1897
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,920
see all that trade back up to

1898
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,460
this is going to stay open why because

1899
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,739
on the four hour chart this is all

1900
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:55,080
balanced back and forth price action so

1901
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,520
there's no there's no inefficiency

1902
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,500
there's no liquidity that's necessary to

1903
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,360
trade to

1904
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,060
so when we trade down through the daily

1905
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,940
inversion forever you got low here our

1906
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,199
attention goes to the Daily inversion

1907
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,580
fair value got consequent encroachment

1908
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,159
and the likelihood of that becoming or

1909
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,020
just a little bit above it like we see

1910
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,159
here

1911
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,140
creating the Friday High

1912
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,320
and we trade up small little Mohawk

1913
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,520
above

1914
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,040
the bearish order block opening price

1915
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,480
which is this change in state of

1916
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,640
delivery just a little bit above the

1917
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,199
daily inversion Fairway got consequent

1918
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,540
encouragement here and then we see what

1919
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,880
non-prone payroll rip through it and

1920
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,440
then attack the low

1921
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,580
here

1922
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,900
there

1923
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,840
digging into that daily fair value sales

1924
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,040
and efficiency

1925
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,020
now notice in here also we have this

1926
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,179
down move here in the next candle we

1927
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:47,640
open and when the candle opened here

1928
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,219
this Wick hadn't formed yet

1929
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,739
so between this candlestick's low

1930
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,540
and where we opened

1931
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,760
this candle was just one single pass

1932
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,400
down which would be looking much like a

1933
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,199
what

1934
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,340
fair value Gap sibi but this candle does

1935
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,400
what immediately trades up

1936
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,080
hits the low and goes just a little bit

1937
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,540
past that what is that it's permissible

1938
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,340
price action

1939
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,960
And Trades lower

1940
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,600
that is my immediate rebalance

1941
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,120
when it does that whenever it does that

1942
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,760
and you have a bias that's bullish or

1943
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,140
bearish in this case it immediately

1944
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,060
rebalanced here that is one of the

1945
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,739
strongest algorithmic signatures you're

1946
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:30,780
going to ever see in price action I'll

1947
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,880
have much more to talk about that in my

1948
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,820
books but for here I'm just reminding

1949
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,199
you that I've already mentioned it here

1950
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,719
on my YouTube channel my long-term

1951
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:42,420
students know about this intimately but

1952
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,520
this immediate rebalance is one of those

1953
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,380
things that tells you that this Market

1954
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,360
is going to be extremely bearish and

1955
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,880
it's going to move fast and then we see

1956
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,080
it run off

1957
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,239
so we have a four hour PD array in the

1958
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,520
form of a immediate rebalance

1959
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,260
and then we have a four hour bearish

1960
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,580
order block

1961
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,679
apart from that nothing else on the four

1962
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,080
hour chart is anything of importance to

1963
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,900
me the annotations here show you that

1964
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,360
the NQ four hour journal entry

1965
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,820
the NQ continuous four-hour contract

1966
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,760
shows how nicely the weekly premium WIC

1967
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,219
consequent encroachment kept price from

1968
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:18,960
rallying higher this week

1969
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,060
that's this level here

1970
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,980
okay

1971
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,440
Tuesday bearish order block and gap

1972
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,840
opening lower was the start of The

1973
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,420
Descent and subsequent sell program

1974
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,060
that's this Gap here

1975
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,040
and bear shorter block so it's hitting

1976
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,780
that and sells off aggressively as it

1977
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,340
enters the cell program

1978
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,340
daily fair value Gap CB can be seen as

1979
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,400
well balanced in the gray area that's

1980
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,199
this area right in here all of this is

1981
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:47,880
well balanced because it's back and

1982
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,739
forth price action it's not just one

1983
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,140
candle it's back and forth up and down

1984
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,620
up and down

1985
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,940
which reinforced the probabilities of

1986
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,560
the daily inversion fair value Gap

1987
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,780
consequent encroachment being Friday's

1988
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,699
high of the day and we see that actually

1989
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:05,040
occurring here so it's going to have a

1990
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,420
real hard time getting through all this

1991
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,940
back and forth delivery when on a daily

1992
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,620
chart it looks like it's inefficient up

1993
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,239
here when it's not so that's the price

1994
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,800
delivery Continuum that I'm referring to

1995
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,719
you have to know what your higher time

1996
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,820
frames are showing you and then inside

1997
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,340
of those are time frames you get into

1998
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,739
the details because as I'm showing you

1999
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,840
here the lower time frames are going to

2000
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,300
show you a much more refined

2001
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,940
rendition of price delivery that is not

2002
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,219
always easily ascertained by looking at

2003
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:33,540
the higher time frame

2004
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,179
the bias in the long-term draw on

2005
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:38,760
liquidity that's the importance of those

2006
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,400
higher time frames but the importance of

2007
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,380
the lower time frame is refining

2008
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,310
Precision it's not noise

2009
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:49,080
[Music]

2010
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,699
okay and finally moving down into the

2011
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,199
hourly chart here this is the last time

2012
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:53,400
frame we're going to look at in this

2013
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,199
presentation because obviously you can

2014
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,600
see it's you know it's very easy for me

2015
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,260
to go on and on and make this a very

2016
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,780
challenging for duration purposes

2017
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,120
presentation

2018
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,940
I know some of you my

2019
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,719
well-rounded students like the really

2020
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,880
really long lectures but I want to keep

2021
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,340
it as short and as concise as possible

2022
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,320
but still hitting the most Salient

2023
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,000
points because I want all of you to be

2024
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,380
doing these types of things because you

2025
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,580
don't do it you're not going to learn

2026
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,719
how to do it well

2027
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:24,060
so we're looking at the 16 minute chart

2028
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,760
or hourly chart and we have all of the

2029
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,260
reference points now obviously this

2030
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,460
looks like an entirely different market

2031
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,620
now doesn't it from the monthly chart

2032
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,600
the weekly chart the daily chart doesn't

2033
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,719
even resemble the same Market at all but

2034
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,060
yet it is the same Market

2035
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,040
so we're using that price delivery

2036
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,900
Continuum working from the higher time

2037
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,699
frame down looking at how each

2038
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:48,300
individual PD array respects and or is

2039
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,520
negated

2040
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,100
in here we see that monthly fair value

2041
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,739
Gap CB this is that shaded area here

2042
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:58,199
the monthly

2043
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:02,880
breaker high is outside the range of

2044
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,480
this time frame the monthly breaker low

2045
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,300
is outside the time frame of this analog

2046
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,360
chart okay so they're they're there if

2047
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,820
we were to scrub down and squeeze or

2048
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,159
condense this chart vertically it would

2049
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:19,920
be up here higher and the low of the

2050
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,679
breaker would be lower than this so for

2051
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,060
the purpose of showing the one hour

2052
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,820
chart time frame

2053
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,040
the respective PD arrays and what was

2054
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,800
Salient for this time frame I've zoomed

2055
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,719
in just to show you this but you can see

2056
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:35,699
this is that daily you get by sending

2057
01:19:35,699 --> 01:19:37,860
balance sell sign efficiency

2058
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,020
and the monthly fair value Gap sippy so

2059
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,199
we know the two premium and premium and

2060
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,060
discount levels okay

2061
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,159
and inside that daily fair value Gap

2062
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,140
City you can see how it's important that

2063
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,320
you label your PD arrays you can't just

2064
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,780
throw a box or a rectangle in there and

2065
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,860
assume that you're gonna remember what

2066
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,560
it is and how to use it so everything

2067
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,900
has to be organized everything has to

2068
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,300
have its place and all the time frames

2069
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,960
that you utilize

2070
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,699
the weekly premium WIC consequent

2071
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:09,780
encouragement

2072
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,420
the four hour bearish order block

2073
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,860
now we have

2074
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,320
this sphere of a gap here

2075
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,719
where's annotation for that it's coupled

2076
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,060
with the four hour immediate rebalance

2077
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,880
and 60 Minute premium fair value Gap

2078
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,980
City that's this one right here

2079
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,320
what's the candlesticks bodies showing

2080
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,400
you

2081
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,400
consequent encouragement half of this

2082
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,440
Gap but what are the Wicks doing

2083
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,840
coloring Outside the Lines

2084
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,820
just trading just a little bit outside

2085
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,040
which is completely reasonable but what

2086
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,480
is it touching

2087
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,820
the previous daily fair value Gap City

2088
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,699
that's not random

2089
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:51,480
so I have in my notes

2090
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,760
when I'm working with price action when

2091
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,520
I'm trading I have all these levels here

2092
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,280
just as a list just like you see price

2093
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,400
from 15 840 and then below that you see

2094
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,100
15 800 and then below that fifteen six

2095
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,640
seven sixty I have every respective PD

2096
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,320
array that I'm showing you here just in

2097
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,960
number format and it's annotation label

2098
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,060
just on a piece of paper that's all it

2099
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,360
is so I don't need a chart

2100
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,000
like I don't I don't need a chart to

2101
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,780
trade

2102
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,940
I just need a piece of paper and know

2103
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,580
what time it is and I can trade off of

2104
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,960
that

2105
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,520
so

2106
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,659
this

2107
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:33,239
60-minute favorite Gap

2108
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:34,400
is a

2109
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,760
[Music]

2110
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,980
convergence with that four hour

2111
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,920
immediate rebalance what does that mean

2112
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,380
this movement right here is this let me

2113
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,520
go back up to the four hour chart so

2114
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,840
that way you know what I'm looking at

2115
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,260
and what you're being shown

2116
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,140
this candle here opening rallying up

2117
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,940
right there this candle right there that

2118
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:56,340
four hour candle inside that four hour

2119
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,920
candle is this

2120
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,219
right here one two three four candles

2121
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:04,440
because for a single 60 Minute candles

2122
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,120
is that four hour chart

2123
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,920
that's that market

2124
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,900
rallying back up creating a four hour

2125
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,640
immediate rebalance

2126
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,880
then what does it do it creates this how

2127
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,679
could you use that well if you're

2128
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:18,360
looking at an hourly chart

2129
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,460
as soon as it does this complete run up

2130
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,040
and then the body closes down in here if

2131
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,080
we open here and rally and touch the top

2132
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,760
of that fair value Gap or here's the

2133
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,239
really fun part if we extend past that

2134
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,179
fair value got right in here right in

2135
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:35,460
there as soon as we trade above that I

2136
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,080
could go short there you can go short

2137
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,460
there

2138
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,780
oh

2139
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,880
that's delicious isn't it where would

2140
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,260
your stop Need to Be Right Above That

2141
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,420
Swing high right there why because this

2142
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,340
is a fair Vegas

2143
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,620
you can't use this one you can't use the

2144
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,420
stop right about that because it's the

2145
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,520
low of that previous daily fair value

2146
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,159
Gap Simi it can touch that that's that's

2147
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,560
reasonable

2148
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,380
but this High here it shouldn't go there

2149
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,120
if it's bearish it shouldn't go there

2150
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,219
why because this should act as a

2151
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:06,960
breakaway Gap

2152
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,880
oh

2153
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,600
that's delicious

2154
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,280
sells off

2155
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,380
and now we go back into this balance

2156
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,239
price range you can see again all this

2157
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,040
back and forth delivery that isn't

2158
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,140
readily available in terms of looking at

2159
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,640
it on a daily chart

2160
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,760
but now look even closer if we take this

2161
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,400
candlesticks low which is the high of

2162
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,739
this daily fair value Gap City so this

2163
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:34,440
shaded pink area here but this candle is

2164
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,400
low

2165
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,860
so this candle is high

2166
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,719
that's the range okay that creates that

2167
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:41,580
daily fair value Gap City

2168
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,500
if we drop a fib

2169
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,179
well neck handle is low and that

2170
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:48,659
candle's high and you add in the 0.75 or

2171
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:50,460
the 0.25 whichever direction you're

2172
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,620
pulling the Fib from the lower quadrant

2173
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,260
of that daily fair value Gap City that's

2174
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,120
this shaded area here

2175
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,760
notice what perhaps also on Friday look

2176
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,040
at the bodies it's respecting that lower

2177
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,659
quadrant

2178
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:05,760
trades up in there there's a mohawk

2179
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,140
right there

2180
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,980
institutional refrigerator drill bang

2181
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,600
sell short

2182
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,260
sell side relative equal lows sell side

2183
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,800
hello

2184
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,140
so I want you to know that you know

2185
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,000
doing these types of things it's

2186
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,400
imperative that you are consistent by

2187
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,620
doing it and by annotating your charts

2188
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,120
and pulling out what's obvious to you

2189
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,179
after the fact it will help reassure

2190
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:35,580
yourself going forward looking at that

2191
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,900
hard right Edge because you'll remember

2192
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,219
things by

2193
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:39,960
associating with them

2194
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,000
previous memories that you've created by

2195
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,280
journaling you're condensing and

2196
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,320
compressing time

2197
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,719
in a manner with experience that didn't

2198
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,280
technically happen but you're recording

2199
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,500
in such a way that it tricks your brain

2200
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,239
into thinking that you did you see it

2201
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,080
coming

2202
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,699
The annotation for the 60 Minute chart

2203
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,620
here is the NQ continuous 60 Minute

2204
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,480
contract presented a really easy

2205
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,159
Wednesday two o'clock in the morning

2206
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,380
fair value Gap City that's this candle

2207
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,480
right there when the four hour posted

2208
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,980
its immediate rebalance that's this

2209
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,600
movement here

2210
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,300
and you can be seen respecting the lower

2211
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,860
quadrant of the daily fair value Gap

2212
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,840
City on Friday at noon

2213
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,420
that's here that's this level here it's

2214
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,340
the lower quadrant of this shaded area

2215
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,320
half of it's here

2216
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,600
and an upper quadrant would be here

2217
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,280
interesting enough that it touches that

2218
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,199
and then this one here now I ain't

2219
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,300
making a big deal about that because the

2220
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,040
inefficiency wasn't created until that

2221
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,739
movement but look that right there we'll

2222
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:36,080
talk about that in my book

2223
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,620
[Music]

2224
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,480
as the bodies of the candles tell the

2225
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,560
narrative

2226
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,960
of lower prices into the close

2227
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,520
and we have that there

2228
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,659
so

2229
01:25:45,659 --> 01:25:47,340
non-front payroll takes out the lows

2230
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,260
here after taking

2231
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,080
buy side then sell side that's what my

2232
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,239
farm payroll does it runs both sides of

2233
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:55,260
the marketplace

2234
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,940
and I've taught that many times and it

2235
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,380
delivered again like gangbusters

2236
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,040
hopefully you found this one insightful

2237
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,840
I hope you learned something about how

2238
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,520
you can journal and the benefits of

2239
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,380
doing so and how it builds an

2240
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,639
understanding about price actions you

2241
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:13,320
can't get by watching videos or reading

2242
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,760
books or listening to anybody just talk

2243
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,699
about price even watching them trade or

2244
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,199
copying them you'll never get this type

2245
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,580
of insight unless you go into your own

2246
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:23,159
chart to annotate them and do it as a

2247
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,260
daily meditation

2248
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,120
and so I'll talk to you next time

2249
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,780
be safe
