1. Bond Market is Bearish.  
2. Dollar Market is also bearish, while always, Bond Market and Dollar Market moves in the opposite direction.  
3. SSL cleared in Dollar Market.  
4. I was waiting for the market to enter the ICT KillZone [NY 03:00].  
5. When SWH cleared in EURUSD in NY 02:40, I was sure it is not true to enter the market before ICT KillZone.    
6. Near the ICT KillZone [03:00], despite seeing REQH[5m] I see -OB[5m], so I take a short position with SL above REQH[5m].   
7. Near the ICT KillZone [05:00] I closed the trade with profit, because today is not a high probability conditions.
