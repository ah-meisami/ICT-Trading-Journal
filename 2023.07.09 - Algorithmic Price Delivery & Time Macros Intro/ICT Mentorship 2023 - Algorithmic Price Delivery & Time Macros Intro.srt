1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,360
welcome back books this is going to be a

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,280
lesson on

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
time elements in algorithm price

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,420
delivery and an introduction to ICT

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,359
macros all right so here is a NASDAQ

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,560
daily chart here I'm going to try to

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,680
give you some context as to how I used

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,619
the macro here on Friday that's a fast

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,640
uh not from here on Friday for July 2023

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,140
so without this

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,719
context really it doesn't help

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,239
to know the specific times of the day

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,700
that are called a macro

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
so again this is why a council many of

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
you not to try to teach something

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,280
that you don't know yet

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,960
and as you can see this is going to be

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
one of those things where it's an

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,360
introduction

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,980
it's not going to satisfy everything

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,980
initially but everything

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,640
leans on other Concepts and aspects to

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,920
my methodology so

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,720
it's just one more piece of the puzzle

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,180
that comes together slowly over time and

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,520
experiences the greatest teacher

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,100
so take a look at this next chart

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,320
and I want you to take a look at this

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,900
down close candle here we dug into that

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,520
one Thursday

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,100
so we have a wick right there

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,200
or tail I guess you would call it

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,659
and whenever I look at a tail or a wick

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,939
my eye goes immediately to the midpoint

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,560
okay that's consequent encouragement the

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,000
algorithm treats this

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,659
has a gap

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,500
on Friday we opened

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,040
traded higher real close to the midpoint

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
of that but what my eye was in addition

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,420
to that Wick my eye was also

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,320
drawn into the high of this candle

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
and the open of that candle

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,079
okay so this is a bull shorter block

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,600
what makes it a bull Shore block

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,759
we are inside of

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,040
this candle in terms of the high and the

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,360
opening price

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
and I'm using those specific price

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,538
points and not

51
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,700
the middle or mean threshold of the body

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,400
or the mean threshold of the entire

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,020
high to low

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,060
I'm using this because this is the last

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,000
down close candle prior to this run up

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,120
after digging into this one so what

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,459
specific kind of order block is this one

58
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,420
here

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,260
if you looked at my month for content

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,440
mentorship my premium mentorship content

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,800
that's on my YouTube channel again it's

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,780
month four and you'll see that there is

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,379
a lecture called propulsion block

64
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,720
propulsion block is something that works

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,040
off of it

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,019
earlier order block so we have an order

67
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,160
block here

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,379
and then this one digs into that one but

69
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,860
you don't ever want to see price go down

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,000
below half of this candle's body and we

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,620
don't get that we get real close to it

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,019
but we don't get it so that to me tells

73
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,879
me that the next day it's still

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,400
advantageous to anticipate higher prices

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,860
I mentioned on

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,680
Twitter ahead of non-profit payroll

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,879
release at 8 30 in the morning near

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,819
political time that I favored

79
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,400
the specific buy side South Side

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,220
liquidities and I showed you that I was

81
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,560
looking for the higher side

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,140
to be ran for first and I'll cancel you

83
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,300
to look at the Twitter you'll see that

84
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,120
so all these things lending well to

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,220
bullish order block Thursday we

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,739
respected the propulsion block

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,540
and

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,879
or not from payroll I was expecting an

89
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,920
initial rally higher and maybe even

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,720
challenge

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
the high up here but we don't know how

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,879
far they're going to rip it or

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,620
trust it really ahead of non-profit

94
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,819
payroll so it's a guessing game in the

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,599
beginning

96
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,000
how you use the information after

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,720
the 8 30 News hits the marketplace that

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,459
manual intervention that's utilized many

99
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,780
times to take both sides of the

100
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,120
marketplace and that means buy side and

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,099
then sell side or sell side then buy

102
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,019
side and then the real move takes place

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,340
so it's generally a whipsop type event

104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,199
so these two levels here

105
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,459
they are respective

106
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,740
and associated with to

107
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,900
these two specific levels on the down

108
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,740
closed candle there

109
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,580
so you can see here on an hourly chart

110
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,940
we have a high to low after taking buy

111
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,380
side here

112
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,000
inefficiency

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and when do Breakers

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,940
not provide the cleanest

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,580
points of rejection or where we can use

116
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,100
them for entries and whatnot

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,560
not for payroll

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
CPI

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,380
and FMC okay those those events

120
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,720
whereas I would usually see

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
high low higher high

122
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,699
in other circumstances I would treat

123
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,780
this

124
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,880
right here I would treat this as a

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,740
bearish breaker and I would not

126
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,740
anticipate this area to be traded to I

127
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,120
would look at this area here as a

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,500
balanced price range

129
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,320
which it is in a sense but I would look

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,800
for this breaker to be utilized so I'm

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,259
taking it through not only the aspects

132
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,300
of time but I'm also telling you

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,780
narrative which is absolutely crucial

134
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,240
to understanding what a macro will do

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,560
okay so it's not a magic pill where all

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,580
of a sudden now you know how to trade

137
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,020
because of there's a specific time of

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,740
day

139
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,419
you still have to have some elements of

140
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,560
understanding what price should likely

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
do and that is complicated it's not easy

142
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,880
you're not going to figure it out you

143
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
know watching this video and going into

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
your charts right away you just want to

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,740
go through the process the rest of this

146
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,080
year as I'm teaching more about them

147
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll have more lectures obviously you

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,360
know and notes for macros in the books

149
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,039
I'm putting out but

150
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,020
it's good enough for you to start with

151
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,419
in studying

152
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,460
so we work up inside this city which is

153
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,800
a premium inefficiency the market wants

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,020
to do what rally higher at non-property

155
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,440
roll reaches into this inefficiency it

156
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,419
doesn't need to go up here right away

157
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,280
because we've had the run on by side

158
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,780
with this here

159
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,580
so all this is the inefficiency the

160
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
price wants to run up to so price only

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,479
rallies to go up to inefficiencies like

162
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,680
here

163
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,380
buy side about here

164
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,740
or it consolidates

165
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,740
or it consolidates and goes below the

166
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,600
marketplace

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
for sell side or inefficiency

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,220
Okay so

169
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,639
note this

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,500
outside efficiency it's a fair value Gap

171
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,240
in this inefficiency here which is a

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,220
city

173
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,319
both are a fair value Gap

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,120
in a 15 minute time frame there's levels

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,319
here shown respectively inside of the

176
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,580
daily

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,639
bullish propulsion block

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,220
highlight

179
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,319
proportion blocks

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,500
Wick and this is the opening of that

181
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,539
daily propulsion block where I spent a

182
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,860
couple minutes explaining what that is

183
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,919
that's these two levels here

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,220
we also have that hourly

185
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,720
fair value Gap

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
which doesn't look like a fair value got

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,380
now once we go into a 15 minute time

188
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,660
frame which is why you want to do a

189
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,160
top down

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,900
from pdra discount and premium and go

191
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,340
through what's available in terms of

192
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,460
price action your first task is to again

193
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,599
identify what is above the marketplace

194
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,000
inefficiency and liquidity by side

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,199
and what's below the marketplace

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,240
inefficiency and sell side

197
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,360
obviously you can get crazy and look Way

198
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Beyond the scope of where the market

199
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,780
will likely reach for

200
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,639
but we want to look at previous days

201
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,380
highs and lows session highs and lows

202
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,940
the highs and lows in the last three

203
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,699
days and previous week high and low so

204
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,460
all those are very quick easy

205
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,099
go to general rules of thumb they'll

206
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,440
serve you extremely well for knowing

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,800
where price will likely gravitate for

208
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,020
inefficiencies or liquidity

209
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,759
so we have non-farm here we're releasing

210
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,580
at 8 30.

211
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,560
and we're in a five minute chart now

212
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,179
here is where I was watching on the

213
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,099
NASDAQ if I was interested in trading

214
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,020
this one not so much on the es and the

215
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,779
reason why I chose NASDAQ not because

216
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,200
it's the better one to trade not because

217
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,140
my tool said to choose this one I was

218
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,300
actually traded in NASDAQ because I had

219
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,459
students asking me okay can you do more

220
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,100
work on NASDAQ because I've been

221
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,779
primarily teaching with the medium of

222
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,339
the even the s p

223
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,959
so I don't want you to think that what

224
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,720
I'm showing here today was a selection

225
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,420
based on anything except for

226
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,160
you my students asking me to perform

227
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,220
something in NASDAQ versus trading it in

228
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,420
the es which is what you've been

229
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,519
predominantly watching me do majority of

230
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,880
this year

231
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
so that bullish propulsion block the

232
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,480
wick High

233
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
the opening of that

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,040
and then that hourly Fair bag Gap that

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
blue shaded area

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
in the middle

237
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
of the propulsion block High

238
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,560
in propulsion block opening price that's

239
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,839
these two specific levels here the high

240
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,240
the wick the opening of the propulsion

241
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,700
block on the daily chart half of that

242
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,160
range is the

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,380
daily bullish order block which is again

244
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,120
propulsion block

245
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,760
premium WIC constant encrosion that

246
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,080
means from the high the propulsion

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,220
blocks

248
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,420
Wick

249
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,459
to the opening of it half of that

250
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,100
remember we treat Wicks and Tails on

251
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,740
candlesticks as gaps and the midpoint is

252
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,779
consequent encouragement that's this

253
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,220
measurement right here

254
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,560
you can see how sensitive is

255
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,680
so the market drops after running up

256
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,420
initially here

257
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,279
comes back down below the lows in here

258
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,220
but digs into

259
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,040
all this order flow but specifically

260
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
right into consequent encouragement of

261
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,600
the bullish daily propulsion block which

262
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,459
is a order block

263
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,440
then the market starts too

264
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,880
move higher

265
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,740
notice what it's doing first it's taking

266
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,839
buy side and trading up into an

267
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,000
efficiency and then

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,660
reverses and goes down to sell side so

269
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,360
one of the things for your notes for

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,500
not from payroll

271
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,880
whatever side of the marketplace it goes

272
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,579
for First Rate as a thirty

273
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,500
news hits

274
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,800
usually not always usually that will be

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,220
the false run so in other words I'll

276
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,320
give you an example here it rallies for

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,420
the buy side first it takes Traders into

278
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
the marketplace traps them long

279
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,320
they want to see it keep going higher

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,420
and then the market trades lower and

281
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,420
takes out the sell stops one anyone that

282
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,980
is long here

283
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,160
and Below recent lows so they are not

284
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
permitted to be allowed

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,940
to ride this up so trap along stop out

286
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,380
any shorts

287
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,120
drop lower

288
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,820
induce new shorts

289
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
crush the lungs

290
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,079
trap them short

291
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,480
accumulate the sell side and then run

292
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,519
for the buy side here and the other

293
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,940
higher time frame drawn liquidity so

294
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,459
this Candlestick right here

295
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,899
that is your bowl of shoulder block

296
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,519
again same premise I used with the daily

297
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,440
chart here the high the wick to the

298
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,660
opening okay so we're highlighting that

299
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,120
you can see a small little Gap right in

300
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,399
here so I'm not highlighting the the Gap

301
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,839
that's the block

302
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,120
of price action between

303
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,680
this high

304
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,019
and that low that's your fair value Gap

305
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,079
but I'm highlighting this older block

306
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,220
that has that fear that you got that is

307
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,200
suggesting that we could go higher after

308
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,540
stops have been taken that is a high

309
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,339
probability bullish order block

310
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,380
so we're looking for this shaded area

311
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,980
here the key off of and use to get in

312
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,360
alignment with

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
price action going higher

314
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,220
three minute chart I'm adding that in

315
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,260
here so you can see inside that border

316
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,899
block the Gap actually gets refined even

317
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,100
better

318
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,240
here

319
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,980
you can see the bodies of the candles

320
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,320
just about respecting that

321
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,360
and then sending higher

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
you have an inefficiency here which is

323
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,220
what an inversion fair value Gap so I'm

324
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,480
going to spare you all that you can add

325
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,220
this to your own charts and for notation

326
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,600
purposes

327
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,579
over here

328
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,200
normally you would see this and people

329
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,940
that look at myself they think this is a

330
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,899
short

331
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,120
they want to go there no order flow is

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,160
bullish stops have been taken

333
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,040
draws here

334
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,500
so all this in balance it goes up into

335
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,779
it and then treats it as support so

336
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,000
they're accumulating more Longs in here

337
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,380
and you'll see that I'm actually doing

338
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,800
that same thing and with my live Trading

339
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,660
it rallies up

340
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,399
taste out the buy side here

341
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,660
so we're dropping down into a one minute

342
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,740
chart

343
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,940
and then we're gonna get to the Brass

344
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,180
tax of the discussion here

345
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,220
when we look at time

346
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,100
or when I'm teaching you time invariably

347
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,339
you know folks that are trading

348
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,760
exclusively with Forex or now have

349
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,740
segwayed from Forex or just started

350
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,500
trading or monitoring and tape reading

351
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,920
the index features which is where I'm

352
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,500
trying to teach right now I want you to

353
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,899
think about how

354
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,839
the characteristics of time

355
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,060
are very unique

356
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,940
to price delivery but across all asset

357
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,079
classes

358
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,720
so what I'm showing you here is how I

359
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,579
internalize price action whether I'm

360
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,920
looking at a 4X pair whether I'm looking

361
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,380
at a commodity or whether I'm looking at

362
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,060
index futures

363
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,760
okay so in my mind when I'm watching

364
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,600
price action I'm aware and conscious of

365
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,579
the seven o'clock to nine o'clock in the

366
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,279
morning New York open Killzone you know

367
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,560
that from my lecture notes and teachings

368
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,660
from Forex

369
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,000
then you have the am session New York am

370
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
session from index trading which is

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,959
beginning of 8 30 in the morning

372
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,820
to noon

373
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,100
then you have what I've taught this year

374
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,860
the 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock AM Silver

375
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,560
Bullet I've recently introduced this

376
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,579
year

377
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,660
macros now macros are very specific

378
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,699
segments of price action

379
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,620
and they're usually 20 minute intervals

380
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,240
not all of them but most of them are 20

381
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,100
minute intervals I'm going to teach you

382
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,680
a few of them this year I'm not going to

383
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,360
teach you all of them I'm not in a

384
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,519
position where I can do that but there

385
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,100
are several of them but these are

386
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,380
specific Windows of opportunity but not

387
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,199
to teach you the introduction to how I

388
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,519
use them

389
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
when we look at Price like this

390
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,620
I want you to see that there is price

391
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,139
running up during non-farm payroll into

392
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,660
that inefficiency

393
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,839
it drops aggressively takes out south

394
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,940
side below these relative equal lows and

395
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,339
then returns into that hourly fair value

396
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,899
gap which is that blue shaded area right

397
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,480
in here

398
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,399
it rounds again it comes back down

399
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,399
touches the tie end of the hourly fair

400
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,480
value Gap

401
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,180
then it rise up into the inefficiency

402
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,880
and takes by side once more what does it

403
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,480
leave and it's weak relative equal lows

404
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,820
and what specific measurement do we have

405
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,660
here

406
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,420
the daily bullish propulsion block which

407
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,040
is only blocked

408
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,079
the consequent encrosion of the high and

409
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,639
the opening price again that level is

410
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,980
this here to here okay those two

411
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,079
respective levels half of that is here

412
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,680
now I already know okay I already know

413
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
the majority of you this is going right

414
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,079
over your head because you want

415
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,420
something where it's an overall oversold

416
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,820
moving average crossover you know

417
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,940
something really simple but I want you

418
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,839
to understand something

419
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,040
these markets are driven by high

420
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,339
frequency algorithm

421
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,100
they are not meant to be easily

422
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,139
understood

423
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,000
the biggest complaint you're going to

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
get if it's not me talking about things

425
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,920
longer than they feel I should it's the

426
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,440
fact that I don't make it easy

427
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,560
you cannot make this topic easy

428
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,779
okay I promise you there's going to be a

429
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,040
lot of folks out there that's going to

430
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,259
start talking about this topic in

431
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,639
YouTube videos they're probably bringing

432
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,000
into their mentorships

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
guaranteed they have no idea to do it

434
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,559
okay they don't and if they did they

435
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,699
would go out there and show you examples

436
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,919
after examples daily every single week

437
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,839
and using the information

438
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,839
you're not going to see that okay so

439
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,119
with that disclaimer

440
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,939
okay and

441
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,579
monologue out of the way I want you to

442
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,980
think about how saying the non-front

443
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,799
payroll event typically performs we have

444
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,100
an initial run by side

445
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,900
sell side

446
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,140
and then time becomes a factor this is

447
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,120
how I teach folks that and I mentioned

448
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,980
this on Twitter space recently a few

449
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,240
days ago

450
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
Twitter space is something that it's

451
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,160
just me audibly talking it's usually a

452
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,660
psychological lecture

453
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,100
and

454
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,980
coaching basically without a chart

455
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,720
encouragement that type of thing and

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
sometimes it's a Woodshed moment where

457
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm scolding you for doing things you

458
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,880
shouldn't do which is something I wish I

459
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,620
would have had done for me when I was

460
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,780
coming up

461
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,340
the sell side again is taken here

462
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,120
when it is traded below these relative

463
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,440
equals and into the bullish propulsion

464
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,340
block

465
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,140
consequent encouragement from the daily

466
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,539
chart that's this

467
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,940
level here the blue line and that blue

468
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,140
line right here

469
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,640
okay

470
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
so you can see right away that's this is

471
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,299
the reason why I have things written out

472
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,980
in

473
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,220
text format okay numerical levels and

474
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
then I'm describing what they are on a

475
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,620
notepad

476
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,780
I don't want all these things on my

477
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,720
chart because it gets on my nerves okay

478
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,600
it's too distracting for me but to teach

479
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,340
you conceptually what it is that I'm

480
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,440
referring to and how to visually see it

481
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm showing it like this with lipstick

482
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,700
on the chart I do not have these things

483
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,080
on my chart

484
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,260
I completely empty my chart of all

485
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,940
things unless I'm recording something

486
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,919
and I'm showing you what I'm observing

487
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,900
or thinking and focusing on at the time

488
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,640
so that way anybody that can come

489
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,140
afterwards and watch the video they

490
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,580
can't say oh well you know you're just

491
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,380
making it up as you go now there's a

492
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,000
very Sound Logic being applied to

493
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
everything that I ever do

494
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,580
and the excuses

495
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,880
that my trolls and detractors will say I

496
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,500
always have something to explain the

497
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,419
marketplace well that's because I know

498
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,620
the marketplace

499
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,720
and I've engineered a lot of things that

500
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,640
you're learning that the marketplace

501
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,760
will use so

502
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,740
go into

503
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,840
the 10 o'clock hour

504
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,059
here

505
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,900
right before 10 o'clock

506
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,780
you have a 10 minute interval 950 that's

507
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,740
here

508
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,520
950 to 10 10. now I already know that

509
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,919
some of you are going to be first-time

510
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,720
viewers of my content and this is going

511
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
to be the video you see first

512
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,679
the things I'm explaining here are going

513
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,620
to seem completely cherry-picked in all

514
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,760
hindsight

515
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,580
but go back and look at the videos that

516
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,620
I share on my Twitter feed where you

517
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,600
actually watch me execute during these

518
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
times of the day I'm doing several

519
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,340
examples recently I've done a few with

520
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,900
the 10 50 to 11 10. and I've done a few

521
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,140
on the 950 to 1010 macro

522
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,400
this 20 minute period specializes in

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
when the market is approaching the first

524
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,559
30 minutes of trading after 9 30 in the

525
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,000
equities Market

526
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,299
that's that last threshold for even when

527
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,419
the Forex markets trading around

528
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,340
okay so if you're a Forex Trader it's

529
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,799
still important to know this if you are

530
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,780
not a Forex Trader and you're using

531
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,940
Futures it's applicable it's all joined

532
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,059
together it's a tapestry of how all the

533
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,460
markets work together harmoniously and

534
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,200
when they aren't harmonious

535
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,179
there's a crack in correlation that in

536
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,860
itself gives you warning signs that

537
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,960
something's about to change

538
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,780
and maybe the chains may be abrupt okay

539
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,179
so that's out that's outside the scope

540
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,520
of this discussion today but I want you

541
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,260
to think about how we were running up

542
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,720
into this inefficiency in this buy side

543
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,280
during

544
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,660
the 950 the 1010 macro what was it doing

545
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,080
it was delivering price to buy side and

546
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
inefficiency

547
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,559
this one single candle passed down so

548
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,380
it's doing two primary functions here

549
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,299
it's running to

550
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,299
an area that will be deemed a premium

551
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,220
relative to the high

552
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,740
and the low here

553
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,039
we rally up to liquidity

554
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,380
rebalance

555
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,299
this inefficiency how do we know that's

556
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,100
balanced because we worked back and

557
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,980
forth in it then we left it

558
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,320
going back in all the bodies are staying

559
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,880
inside of it is respecting that that's

560
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,460
that's narrative that's how you read

561
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,840
candlesticks it's not what Steve

562
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,700
Nielsen's stuff okay

563
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,799
this right here

564
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,220
sees us drop lower what's occurring at

565
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,679
the 9 50 to 10 10.

566
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,179
it's already worked in this liquidity

567
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,460
what is it going to deliver next well

568
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,700
what's the profile for not far payroll

569
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,580
we ran by side we left relative equal

570
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,659
lows

571
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,700
we've been bullish on s p we've been

572
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,220
bullish on NASDAQ so it's going to drop

573
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,020
down and take the other side of the

574
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
marketplace out

575
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,380
because they've engineered liquidity

576
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,080
here using this hourly

577
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,880
fair value Gap

578
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,860
And Trades down into the midpoint or

579
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,280
consequent encroachment of that daily

580
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,520
propulsion block

581
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,820
I can imagine how this would feel

582
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,440
bewildering for a new Trader or new

583
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
student okay

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,720
you do not need to know how to do this

585
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,820
to learn how to trade properly with my

586
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,299
stuff I'm only producing this to show

587
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,120
you the level of detail

588
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,880
that the algorithm refers back to when

589
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,799
it's timing its movements for liquidity

590
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,020
when is it timing its movement for

591
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,100
inefficiencies and how it utilizes time

592
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,980
look at it like this we have the New

593
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,799
York open Kill Zone okay the majority of

594
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,080
it is quiet and then at 8 30 we have the

595
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,020
release of the non-prompt payroll you go

596
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,340
something inefficiency

597
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,740
at that moment we have an overlap of the

598
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,120
9 30 am

599
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
and the New York open Killzone right in

600
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,799
here there's a lot of overlap where

601
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,260
there's going to be a lot what

602
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,740
volatility we quickly drop down one more

603
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,200
time in efficiency but least majority of

604
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
it open then we're rips lower

605
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,080
trades into the hourly fair value Gap

606
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,140
then we chop around a little bit trade

607
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,539
back up into the inefficiency at 950 to

608
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,240
10 10 and then it will do what it will

609
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,600
start its protraction lower

610
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,840
to go into this liquidity here

611
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,140
this drop here all this movement notice

612
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,740
how all this price run is during the am

613
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,020
Silver Bullet 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock

614
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,600
in the morning and the New York am

615
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,640
session between 8 30 and noon New York

616
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,559
local time

617
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,039
so we can see and anticipate many times

618
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,360
where you'll see me doing executions

619
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,640
I'll say I'm looking for Speed now I

620
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,380
want to see big candles I want to see

621
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,159
movement that's a sharp drop or a a

622
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,960
strong Rally from here

623
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
I'm utilizing this type of information

624
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,260
here

625
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,559
the macro in itself is just a Time

626
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,520
window where the 950 to 1010 what this

627
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,460
is actually specializing in is it's the

628
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,480
first

629
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,440
20 to 30 and then 40 minutes of the

630
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
trading hour

631
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,460
starting at 9 30. so an equities Market

632
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,860
opens at 9 30 the stock market Bell

633
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,720
starts ringing

634
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
the first 30 minutes is the opening

635
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
range

636
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,700
but that opening range doesn't have to

637
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,840
or

638
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,659
is required to be 30 minutes before the

639
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,179
actual range is useful

640
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,580
it can

641
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,440
form in 20 minutes and then whatever

642
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,080
liquidity is utilized there outside that

643
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,179
parameter high and low

644
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,220
it'll help you determine where the

645
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,440
market will likely go to next

646
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
I'll have more teachings on the living

647
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,500
range but at 9 50 to 10 10 what is

648
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,240
actually happening is is the run that

649
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,100
starts at 9 30.

650
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,419
here

651
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,640
it goes into the liquidity here so now

652
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,279
we start a macro between 950 and 10 10.

653
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,860
a macro is a short list of directives

654
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,039
that the algorithm will run it's like a

655
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,960
a small little

656
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,559
list of orders that it has to do to then

657
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,419
seek where liquidity and or if

658
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,159
inefficiencies are we've already went

659
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
into a premium relative to the high and

660
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
low we're into inefficiency and we've

661
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
already bumped by side so two functions

662
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,260
of delivery of price has been met both

663
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,120
of them for the purposes of seeking

664
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,000
liquidity and inefficiency it has

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
balance this out here

666
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,440
and then it starts its Run for the

667
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,020
opposing side of liquidity

668
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,760
why is it not going to keep going higher

669
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,919
why is this not a bull flag because the

670
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,340
parameters of the buy side here and the

671
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,360
sell side

672
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,940
we have to incorporate the profile of

673
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,460
non-farm payroll which is what

674
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,080
first rally

675
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,600
then go down take out the stops and then

676
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,340
resume going higher

677
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,580
or drop down take out sell side then run

678
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,200
higher take out the buy side and then

679
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
drop down

680
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,740
or just be a choppy you know mess that

681
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,960
non-forward payroll can many times be

682
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,159
we drop down during the peak of Silver

683
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,840
Bullet 10 to 11 time window

684
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,760
there is a silver bullet entry in here

685
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,520
there is a silver bullet entry in here

686
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,500
they're on am session Silver Bullet time

687
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,279
window

688
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,799
trades down to consequent encroachment

689
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,020
of the bullish propulsion block on the

690
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,200
daily chart and it's also

691
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,960
consequent encroachment of the hourly

692
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,179
Fairbank got the Shaded in blue notice

693
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,740
that

694
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,320
then we rally a little bit

695
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,200
short-term High We Pierce that we have

696
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,779
an older block again

697
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,100
that was shaded from the higher time

698
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,299
frame

699
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,220
you drop down touch another order block

700
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,720
on the hourly chart so you can see the

701
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,520
hierarchy from higher time frame down

702
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,220
the lower time frame the market touches

703
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,860
it beautifully stops perfectly at this

704
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,260
opening price the down closed candle

705
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,240
inside that shaded area which is a

706
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,580
larger time frame or higher time frame

707
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,559
order block from high to opening price

708
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,659
as a dead green shaded area was

709
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,419
and then we rally what does it form

710
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,700
right here during the 1050 to 11 10.

711
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,600
what is the significance with 1150 to 11

712
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,679
10.

713
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,260
you're ending the 10 o'clock till 11

714
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,480
o'clock hour which is the first 90

715
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,700
minutes of trading and then we're going

716
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,020
to enter

717
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,779
the time of day where we enter a New

718
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,000
York lunch and New York launch has its

719
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,980
own macro or it usually runs for

720
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,460
liquidity

721
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,020
we have a low high lower low making this

722
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,360
these up close candles of two of them

723
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,900
that makes this a bullish breaker

724
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,419
and we can utilize that and anticipate

725
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,960
higher prices

726
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,000
running for the buy side here

727
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,360
the buy side here and the high of

728
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,120
the inefficiency that shaded here on

729
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
fire timeframe charts I want you to

730
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,580
think about how the macro time

731
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,299
is utilized for the market to begin its

732
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,460
run for liquidity

733
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,320
the run for inefficiency

734
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,980
What specifically is 1050 well it's 10

735
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,539
minutes before 11 o'clock

736
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,960
that's essentially the height of London

737
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,179
clothes for Forex

738
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,620
then we have

739
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,480
the last

740
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,600
hour before we get to New York lunch now

741
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,980
there's a lot of people that argue

742
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,419
because there's no open outcry anymore

743
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,179
like it used to be and you know the

744
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,740
markets are electronic nobody goes to

745
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,779
lunch doesn't matter the markets will

746
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,940
enter some measure of consolidation

747
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,440
going into lunch

748
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,320
it'll run for liquidity or it can

749
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,299
reverse okay so there's three primary

750
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,279
functions that the launch Arrow will do

751
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,860
you have to be able to fit that into the

752
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,020
market profile for that particular day

753
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,720
and we have a non-farm payroll event so

754
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,380
we've seen the initial run here by side

755
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,580
engineered sell side then it drops it

756
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,919
down for sell side now it's free to go

757
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,200
higher because no one's long they got

758
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,539
stopped out anyone that was buying long

759
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,399
on the breakout was raked across the

760
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,320
coals anyone that went short breaking

761
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,760
out below these relative equal lows here

762
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,440
are trapped short then the market can go

763
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,260
higher

764
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,000
so I want you to see

765
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,220
that these time Windows these macros

766
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,860
they're just

767
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,460
a Time aspect to when I anticipate the

768
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,340
market to start reaching start doing

769
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,520
some showing animation okay it's not

770
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,860
enough to Simply know these times a day

771
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,620
inside those respective times there are

772
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,960
specific times in Windows of opportunity

773
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,419
for me and you know you as my students

774
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,419
to anticipate a specific phenomenon in

775
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,460
price where it will start behaving like

776
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,320
we would expect it to

777
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,020
it will start running for liquidity it

778
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,120
will start running for inefficiency

779
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,620
if the macros do not provide

780
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,600
that timing aspect and the market just

781
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
simply doesn't budge that is many times

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,640
a beautiful illustration for you to stop

783
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,340
looking and closure charts

784
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,399
because the Market's ran algorithmically

785
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,720
whether you want to believe it or not

786
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,220
that's the facts

787
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,860
and if these elements are not producing

788
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,200
movement

789
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,260
driving price to either inefficiencies

790
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,380
or liquidity if it's not showing any

791
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,779
movement that you would expect it fits

792
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,820
your analysis where you think the next

793
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,320
strong liquidity is going to be if

794
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
that's not occurring you have to close

795
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,419
your charts and trade the next session

796
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,279
there's macros in the afternoon there's

797
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,140
macros during the launch hour okay

798
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,500
there's macros in the London session I'm

799
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,940
showing you these two here because I

800
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,740
just recently used them proving that

801
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,539
they exist

802
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:50,520
okay all emacro is is the beginning of a

803
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,340
spooling event spooling is where price

804
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,360
starts to reach for it it reaches for

805
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,960
um

806
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,480
think about like a fishing rod you ever

807
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,799
been fishing before

808
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,779
and you have your hook and your weight

809
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,700
on the end of it and your baits on the

810
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,279
hook and you cast the

811
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,380
fishing line out into the water what's

812
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,179
occurring with the fishing line it's

813
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,000
spooling it's it's running off this this

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,039
reel

815
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,100
a fishing line and it's delivering that

816
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,799
hook that weight and that bait

817
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,140
far away from where you're standing

818
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,360
that's what that's what these macros are

819
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,640
doing it's like casting price away

820
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,140
higher or lower

821
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,299
and I'm watching these specific times a

822
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,940
day to do those very things it is not

823
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,399
going to give you a Direction

824
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,200
okay so when you see these people out

825
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,520
there trying to talk about how yeah the

826
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,039
macro here and this is how you know it's

827
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,120
going to be a bias how you know it's

828
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,700
gonna be yourself no you need to require

829
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,720
your understanding about all the other

830
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
things I'm teaching you you still have

831
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,380
to know how to tape read you still need

832
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,059
to know how to determine a bias you

833
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,620
still need to know where liquidity is

834
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,620
and how you use that liquidity and work

835
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,080
within a higher time frame

836
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
analysis

837
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,179
otherwise this is not going to help you

838
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,299
it's not going to help you okay so if

839
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,320
you don't

840
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,419
know everything else that I'm teaching

841
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,919
this is going to be a point of

842
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,720
frustration for something for a majority

843
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,340
of you I'm going to read complaints

844
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,659
people are going to complain about me in

845
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,480
other people's videos I don't care I

846
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,640
know how to use it it's not imperative

847
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,279
that you learn how to use it but I

848
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,140
wanted to show you again proof that

849
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,880
these markets are algorithmic and they

850
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,179
operate on the basis of time first

851
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,539
time is the first crucial Factor before

852
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,460
price will move

853
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,039
unless a bomb drops unless there's some

854
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
kind of geopolitical upheaval something

855
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,100
crazy unexpected Swan event occurs the

856
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,919
markets are not moving randomly

857
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,779
they're not just popping off it whenever

858
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,640
you know a lot of buyers or sellers

859
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,320
coming up they're not going to be moving

860
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,460
because a whole bunch of people on

861
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,080
Reddit are going to try to take down the

862
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,899
hedge funds and go against them all that

863
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,260
stuff is nonsense

864
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,640
and all of these markets whether you

865
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,080
choose to believe it or not every asset

866
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,359
class are driven by artificial

867
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,800
intelligence that artificial

868
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,440
intelligence is an algorithm and it

869
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,719
follows instructions that were coded for

870
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,500
it

871
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,800
and it runs things based on time

872
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,719
period

873
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,820
so let's take a look at this in

874
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,060
relationship to where I executed and how

875
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,980
I traded it you can see how I use this

876
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,220
information

877
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,719
go and I'll take them on and off you can

878
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,820
see they're being

879
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,379
populated

880
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,599
as an subtracted from the chart

881
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,339
and there's executions

882
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,760
and over the course of the entire day

883
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
[Music]

884
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,280
you can see the executions

885
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,690
as well

886
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,940
[Music]

887
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,099
so that's a marketer cell model

888
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,200
all right folks hopefully you got

889
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,640
something out of this one

890
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,740
I understand it's probably very Advanced

891
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,660
and it's probably left you with more

892
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,920
questions and that's wonderful that

893
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,380
means you have opportunity to grow in

894
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,820
your understanding if you don't have any

895
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,680
questions you know

896
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,180
it's a problem you probably didn't watch

897
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,359
it close enough but the a macro is

898
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,780
simply a time of day where price will

899
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,200
begin to spool that's all it is it's

900
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
reaching for liquidity or it's reaching

901
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,920
for inefficiency if the market is not

902
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,560
showing signs of respecting that measure

903
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,180
of time

904
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,599
then it's probably indicative of a

905
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,339
bailout and don't do anything with that

906
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,900
session or maybe even that trading day

907
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,480
and it'll probably spare you some

908
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,180
drawdown and or losing trades

909
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,980
and so I'll talk to you next time

910
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,579
be safe
