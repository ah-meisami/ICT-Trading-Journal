Weekly CFD Expiration Rollover [https://www.xtb.com/en/education/what-are-rollovers]

What Is a Contract Rollover?
In a nutshell, a rollover is a purely technical operation that ensures the Contracts For Differences (CFDs) that you can trade on XTB's platforms always reflect market conditions in the best way possible.

A futures contractâ€™s expiration date is the last day you can trade that contract. Prior to expiration, a futures trader has three options:

- Offsetting or liquidating the position
- Settlement
- Rollover
A rollover occurs when a trader moves their position from the front month contract to another contract further in the future. Traders will determine when they need to move to the new contract by watching the volume of both the expiring contract and next month contract. A trader who is going to roll their positions may choose to switch to the next month's contract when volume has reached a certain level in that contract.
