1
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,380
well good morning folks

2
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
it is a good morning

3
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,720
it won't be in about uh 19 minutes or so

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
retail Traders are going to get smoked

5
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,920
CPI numbers due out this morning it is

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,220
important that you try not to uh

7
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,640
get ahead of that because it can be

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
somewhat destructive if you're incorrect

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
in your assumptions or your analysis

10
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,900
and I stand in in the sidelines of this

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,259
report I I've been burned by many times

12
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,840
so

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,600
we're gonna take a look at the es and

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,159
quick pass through

15
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,680
euro dollar and cable in the dollar

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,899
Index we'll take a look at NASDAQ we'll

17
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,420
take a look at the Dell futures

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,299
and we'll peek at Gold

19
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,659
okay so that's what's on

20
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,459
tap for this morning I want to talk a

21
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,619
little bit about the

22
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,160
where setups form how you can trust

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,140
the principles I'm teaching but we're

24
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,120
going to watch CPI live

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
so it's important you also understand

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,879
that

27
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,400
anything I tell you today

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,260
should be viewed

29
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,720
from the safety of a laboratory

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
experiment that means you're not even

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
trying to trade a demo

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,340
you're not even

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,980
tempted at all to take any trade based

34
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,540
on what I'm going to tell you today I'm

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,379
not

36
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,940
I will not

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm not going to come back later on say

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
you want to do so and so here's what I

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,040
did because I'm going to be here right

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,860
here live with you

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,260
so let's take a quick look at

42
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,160
let's start with the dollar Index

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,720
okay and it's

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,800
she'll run a weekly chart

45
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,640
and we're at the bottom of that Gap in

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,260
here let me

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,519
zoom in there's a whole lot of

48
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,659
annotations in here from

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,940
our recent discussions pertaining to

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,260
dollar

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,780
so this this Gap in here

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,280
originally we treated that as an

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,900
inversion Gap

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,480
come down and act as

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,060
support to take us up into our premium

57
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,860
arrays

58
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,440
we have since worked lower back inside

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,879
this

60
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,220
Gap and I mentioned in the last

61
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,480
commentary

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,280
that I want to see if it wants to go

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,659
outside of this

64
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,659
and then treat this shaded area here

65
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,239
as resistance okay so so far we've came

66
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,659
down and we respected the the low of it

67
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,519
I'll drop down into a daily I'll try to

68
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,480
get through this pretty quick because I

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,980
only have a few minutes before CPI comes

70
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,040
out

71
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,340
okay so we have somewhat of a small

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
little

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,480
remaining Gap here with in order block

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,300
so I'm going to note that here

76
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,720
so I'll be watching that going into the

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,519
rest of this week

78
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,359
I don't like the color

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,419
it does not mean okay does not mean for

80
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,000
you to go in here and assume that dollar

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
is going to sell off right away because

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
I see these buttons there I want to see

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,120
if CPI supports this this idea so that's

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,360
why I tell you don't stand ahead or get

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
in front of the CPI number because it

86
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,460
can be very

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,979
one-sided it could smoke you easily your

88
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,800
stop loss will not protect you

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,740
it won't have any protective

90
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,820
characteristics at all because price can

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
Gap right on through

92
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,880
and the liquidity is pulled okay

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
believing there's a lot of people out

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,340
there that want to trade it

95
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,660
but

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,300
Brokers liquidity providers they pull

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,680
the liquidity

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
they don't let you connect Okay so

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,460
because of that you want to stand aside

100
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,540
let the initial

101
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,020
I guess uh chaos hit the marketplace

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,960
let the victims start bleeding and then

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,680
once the impact crater has been created

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,180
then you go around you look around for

105
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,759
the easy targets you know who's who's

106
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,460
left that could be uh taken out with

107
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,160
either short-term liquidity runs or runs

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,880
to inefficiencies so we we treat that

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,880
surge in price action by the CPI number

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,340
as a means of creating that first

111
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,680
initial shock like imagine right now the

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,860
the surface of a pond real smooth

113
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,360
mirror-like

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,039
and then CPI is going to be like a

115
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,539
boulder being dropped in the middle of

116
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,300
it and that first splash

117
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,759
we don't want to be harmed by that and I

118
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,740
don't want any of you my students

119
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,720
being harmed by that but once that

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
occurs there's lots of new ripples

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,340
and every

122
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,220
advancing outward moving circle from

123
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,680
that impact

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
or all opportunities and each one of

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,419
them are respective to their specific

126
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,280
time frame so there's setups that are

127
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,539
forming all the time across all

128
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,740
different

129
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,919
one minute second charts 15 minute

130
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,419
charts there's all kinds of

131
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,580
opportunities and whatever one suits you

132
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,460
is the one that's for you

133
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,199
but I want to see if it wants to get

134
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,900
below this then treat this as resistance

135
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,639
and start to gravitate towards this I'm

136
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,039
not suggesting it we'll do it on one

137
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,100
Fell Swoop today but obviously it can do

138
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,080
that because this type of Market driver

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
that can create those types of runs but

140
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,380
I want to see does it want to get down

141
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,120
into here and then

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,039
reprice to this inefficiency between

143
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,160
these candles hi and this candle is low

144
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,259
more specifically the opening price of

145
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,400
this down close Candle on the daily

146
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
chart

147
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,840
and

148
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,340
let's go over to euro

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
all right in similar fashion we have a

150
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,620
very shorter block here very small

151
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,120
little Gap

152
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,979
here I'm going to show you the the tooth

153
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,960
level so you can see there's a

154
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,180
separation it's not much but it's there

155
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,230
okay so this order block

157
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,940
so reaching up into this down closed

158
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,440
candles range

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,240
repricing to the separation between

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,580
these two candles so this candle beneath

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,380
my cursor that candle is low

162
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,479
and this candle is high okay the candle

163
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,580
right above my cursor that candle is

164
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,759
high okay that small little inefficiency

165
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
I want to see does CPI lend well

166
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,400
to it wanting to get up into that area

167
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
it's a small little pool of liquidity in

168
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,699
the form of buy stops that will be

169
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,380
resting about this you don't need any

170
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,360
kind of Market map

171
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,199
um

172
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,139
and Mark of what's it

173
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,740
ugh they escaped me I mean there's lots

174
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,780
of resources out there that are trying

175
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,479
to show you where supposed orders are

176
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,800
resting whatever you don't need any of

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
that okay book map I think that's what

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,200
it's called

179
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,120
um book math if you're listening it's no

180
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,860
offense to you I'm just suggesting that

181
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,620
you know there are ways of doing what

182
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,839
you make available visually which is

183
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,099
great in the beginning I probably would

184
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,320
have used something like that but if you

185
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,540
study price action naked you'll see you

186
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,100
know above swing highs and short-term

187
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,480
highs and lows

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,080
um there's obvious stops in liquidity

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,660
and when the market has moved away from

190
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
this Gap here

191
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,740
traded above the short term High here

192
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,779
relative equal highs so I want to see

193
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,220
does it have a willingness to use the

194
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,440
CPI number to expand into this direction

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
now if we take out this low here

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,839
and very specific

197
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,120
get below the consequent encroachment of

198
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
this Wick

199
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,779
why this one because the difference

200
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,700
between the candles open and close on

201
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,399
this one inside of the Gap this one over

202
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,320
here

203
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
it left

204
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,740
that Fairway got here there was a change

205
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,100
in the state of delivery right there

206
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,060
so if we get through the consequent

207
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,399
encouragement of this Wick

208
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
that to me spells bearishness on euro

209
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,380
dollar and dollar might surprise to the

210
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,360
upside but as long as that does not

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
happen

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,140
I'm looking for this order block

213
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,360
in this guy now

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,160
for the slow folks

215
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,040
I did not give you a two scenario I'm

216
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,380
going to come back in here I'm right I'm

217
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,839
telling you what I'm looking for because

218
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,060
I don't know at the time at the very

219
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,040
time we're sitting here live I don't

220
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
know if I knew I'd be Trading

221
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,380
it's CPI I have no idea what they're

222
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,360
going to do and CPI is one of those

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,120
events like fomc rate announcements

224
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
which we'll have tomorrow

225
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,740
this week is littered with landmines so

226
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,320
I teach my students if you have a week

227
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,279
like this you want to try to get

228
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,779
yourself on Monday

229
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,140
and Monday was a pretty good day

230
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,480
if you want to see a review of how I

231
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,360
took yesterday's uh trade and thumbs up

232
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,580
this live stream and it'll inspire me to

233
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,320
do a secondary video later in the

234
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
afternoon we'll do a review and I'll

235
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
walk you through what I did and how I

236
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,779
saw it in all business but for now we're

237
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,220
focusing on the CPI so I'm looking for

238
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,760
evidence to support a bias for the rest

239
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,839
of the week

240
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,420
so it'll give me insight to see how they

241
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,839
use this data manual intervention

242
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,660
is where the quote-unquote powers that

243
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,660
be you call them market makers

244
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
they are

245
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
the

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
the folks are in charge of how far these

247
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,760
markets will go when they'll move

248
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,000
and what price is going to be period it

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,079
has nothing to do with your buying and

250
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,519
selling pressure all of our gimmicks all

251
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,779
of our order blocks all of our supply

252
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,120
and demand harmonic patterns none of

253
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,980
that matters when they step in

254
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,140
they will literally reprice to another

255
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,920
price level and it doesn't matter

256
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
what Carnage is Created from that so

257
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,640
that's the reason why I'm telling you

258
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,880
that this type of Market driver CPI is

259
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,019
dangerous

260
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,899
you can't trust even my own Concepts in

261
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,000
front of a move like this because

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,459
it can roll right over top of it

263
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,459
and I have been very candid about how I

264
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,519
get many times this very CPI number

265
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,980
wrong it's only very few times I've been

266
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,380
able to publicly call it and be correct

267
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,140
so I want you to respect the measure of

268
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,019
risk do not look at anything I'm saying

269
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,240
today as a little nudge to say here

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,040
here's our secret little handshake go

271
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,959
take this straight please don't do that

272
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,959
okay if you're right it was luck

273
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,180
I promise you on a day like today with

274
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,760
CPI if you make money it's luck

275
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,040
that's the only time luck exists when

276
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
it's a complete uncertainty and you just

277
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,200
happen to be on the side that worked

278
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
so I don't trade with luck I don't rely

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,899
on luck I I don't have that in in my

280
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,000
uh

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,480
expressions for trading it's it's it

282
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,260
doesn't exist you make the results and

283
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,959
skill set and experience dictate that so

284
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,940
that's what I'm looking for I favor this

285
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,019
right now so that way you understand

286
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,779
what's going on but if I'm wrong

287
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,180
where do where do I concede and say I'm

288
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,279
wrong and then I look at the market from

289
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,800
the opposite end as I mentioned it needs

290
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,760
to get below the consequent correction

291
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,079
of this week because that's where the

292
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,560
state of delivering changed

293
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,660
inside this Gap inside of seeing us run

294
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,459
higher we've taken them a pool of

295
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,240
liquidity out here

296
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,320
and we went a little bit higher but

297
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
these are relative equal highs I don't

298
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
know if they're using that right there

299
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,500
and then CPI sinks us and they make

300
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,019
aggressive runs for sell side below here

301
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,019
I I don't know so it's important for you

302
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,399
to understand that there are times where

303
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,240
your analysis your experience your model

304
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
will be silent

305
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,660
it does not mean it's broken it doesn't

306
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,700
mean that they changed the algorithm it

307
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,220
just means that you have to sit still

308
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,380
and you have to exercise discipline and

309
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,600
self-control and wait for the market to

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
give you your setup

311
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,360
you're not trying to be like a crack

312
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,040
fiend okay out there with your crack

313
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,720
pipe every single day trying to smoke

314
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,060
Pips and and points in these markets

315
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,820
because it's moving around

316
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,600
you just got to sit still okay

317
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,940
so that's the two things I'm looking for

318
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,800
for

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,160
fiber I'll take a quick peek at cable

320
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,579
all right cable I believe this is nice

321
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,600
came down inside this

322
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,220
by side of balance outside efficiency

323
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,500
which is a FVG but it's in a

324
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,420
buy side imbalance also an efficiency it

325
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,459
trades down to it here and then look at

326
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,320
the reaction so far today so I want to

327
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,839
see us return back up into this

328
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,220
Gap I'll show you in a second where

329
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,880
that's anchored

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
it's on a weekly chart I apologize let

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
me go back up to that

333
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,600
so that's that inefficiency right there

334
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,500
so I want to see does it return back

335
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,660
into that if it does it has unfinished

336
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,699
business all in here

337
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,380
that's assuming obviously if the dollar

338
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,980
falls off

339
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,579
let's go back into it daily

340
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,100
so far really Cable's been just hanging

341
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,959
around this large consolidation

342
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,300
not a whole lot of activity even though

343
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,880
we came down into this Gap

344
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
and traded into it and showed initial

345
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,839
willingness they want to go higher

346
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,779
we have to overcome this

347
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,959
okay so let's show that in perspective

348
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,500
so it's gonna have to make a real

349
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
meaningful move outside of that

350
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,459
that range here I'm keeping it faint

351
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,779
like that you might want to use a dark

352
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,779
color but the the real level I'm trying

353
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,820
to be interested in is here so if we

354
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,680
trade above it fall short and come back

355
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
down to Middle

356
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,240
of this inefficiency that would be

357
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,680
consequently encroachment in the form of

358
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,079
potential support so if we run up fail

359
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,279
to get to here

360
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,220
that shaded area like run above and come

361
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,120
back down

362
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,800
the lower time frames might give us an

363
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,740
idea after CPI that would be something I

364
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,540
would look for it's not a trade idea

365
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,100
it's just something I'm running certain

366
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,440
terms of scenarios what do I look for

367
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,899
what would I wait for after CPI if you

368
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,660
don't trade ahead of CPI ICT what are

369
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,760
you looking for after CPI what are those

370
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,260
types of things it's those these things

371
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,779
here I'm trying to outline to you

372
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,980
and let's take a quick look at NQ

373
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,680
we are looking at the September delivery

374
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,440
contract month now it's symbol U so

375
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,899
nqu2023

376
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,019
I saw a guy post a tweet to me saying he

377
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,019
was looking for NQ q q is the month code

378
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,579
for August and August is not a delivery

379
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,440
month for index features it's only March

380
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
which is H

381
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,639
June which is M September which is U and

382
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,620
Z for December there's only four

383
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,600
contract delivery months for indexes so

384
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,519
or indices I should say

385
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
all right so here is the

386
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,180
term

387
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,100
here is the weekly view on NQ

388
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,440
and like I said this was the performer

389
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,000
on the upside the strongest one and it

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,839
has delivered so

391
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,040
and drop down to it daily

392
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,299
all right this one here

393
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,699
only experience speaking here okay

394
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,859
um because we have a great announcement

395
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,980
fomc really afternoon tomorrow and

396
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,540
Wednesday and we have the CPI number

397
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,819
this morning which will be out in about

398
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,260
four minutes or so a little less than

399
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,299
four minutes I gotta hurry up uh this

400
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,860
sell side

401
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
looks suspect even though we had a

402
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,820
really nice run up in here

403
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,799
um

404
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,299
I just feel like they're gonna make an

405
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,860
attempt to get into this this week will

406
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,600
it be today or tomorrow I don't know

407
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,539
but this looks too clean way way way too

408
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,460
clean and

409
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,080
even if it went down there that would

410
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,500
upset folks thinking that it's topped

411
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,299
and then to me if it went down below

412
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,500
that and rallied and create another

413
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,480
short-term inefficiency that would be

414
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,940
bullish that could continue going higher

415
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
this would upset those individuals that

416
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,620
see this as support or real good area to

417
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,320
Trail stop losses below that

418
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,059
um BS real quick

419
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,240
foreign

420
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,860
I don't I don't see the same thing there

421
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,160
but if NQ draws down there that s p

422
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,900
would want to follow suit

423
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm not trying to pick the top I'm the

424
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,039
same CPI I look at that number that

425
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,140
comes out as a means of trying to smash

426
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,000
anyone that's profitable

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,700
it can in some instances be used to

428
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,520
continue or capitulate and move that

429
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,539
means something that's already in a

430
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,400
movement like this it could accelerate

431
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,100
and add the last piece of it

432
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,380
so again that's the reason why I'm not

433
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,700
getting ahead of it and trying to trade

434
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,799
and then the Dow

435
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,980
this one here I favor or run Above This

436
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,140
High here

437
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,000
I think that would be something to

438
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,160
expect because it's been the the sixth

439
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,380
sister of all three indices NASDAQ I

440
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,480
told you would be the leader our Focus

441
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,919
has been teaching through the price

442
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,320
delivery of e-mini s p

443
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,440
and the Dow I use it as a barometer like

444
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,660
I use the dollar Index I don't trade the

445
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,400
dollar Index but I use it as a risk on

446
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,660
risk off

447
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,179
for comparative studies and relative

448
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,400
strength studies for

449
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
the indices I use the dial so for like

450
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,880
dial Theory smt diversions is six sister

451
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,700
Concepts those types of things I I lean

452
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,160
on the Dow for that purpose we have a

453
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,299
little bit of an inefficiency right in

454
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,620
here so we could if we're going to drop

455
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,240
initially on CPI it could go down there

456
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
and then make a run up into that that

457
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,419
would be a scenario I would watch and

458
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,460
see if it manifests today and it's not a

459
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,900
trade idea so please don't take that as

460
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,679
such

461
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,140
quickly go back into es we'll drop into

462
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
a lower time frame oops Soldier gold

463
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,240
sorry real quick let me see if I can

464
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,960
hold on

465
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,780
uh gold

467
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
um

468
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,900
I don't know

469
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
there you go I've gone to my head I

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,380
would say it's going to run

471
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,419
or the sell side below here

472
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,000
there you go that's what I think I'm

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,320
probably wrong please don't trade it

474
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,260
okay but I I wouldn't touch this at all

475
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,559
yes it's dropped down to a 15 minute

476
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,900
time frame

477
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,539
smaller Gap in here

478
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,100
buy side rests above here

479
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,500
so 30 seconds or so

480
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,240
everybody that's

481
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,860
you know trade is going to regret having

482
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,760
been

483
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,980
in it

484
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,960
and everybody that gets lucky you're

485
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,620
posted on social media and offer signals

486
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,840
per purchase

487
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,520
so here's where our sell side is I'm

488
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,600
going to try to keep the annotations

489
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
like this focus on my viewpoints sell

490
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,860
sides here buy side here inefficiency

491
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,780
it's rate if I can get down here before

492
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,440
it pops off

493
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,620
so you want to trade CPI do you

494
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,140
so I ran up and hit our survey gut I was

495
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,580
talking about ran through it a little

496
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,679
bit that's okay what's this mean

497
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
threshold of here then swept the sell

498
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,580
side now buy sides next

499
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,539
okay just a quick look at NASDAQ

500
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,720
so it's taken its South Side here then

501
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,760
ran for buy side

502
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,299
down

503
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,360
we're at 15 minute time frame

504
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,559
quick look at the daily on the dial

505
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,640
yeah I like this high

506
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,559
so would I ever have a wick like this

507
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,520
I'll measure the midpoint which is

508
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,380
consequent encroachment

509
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,659
that would be first objective and then I

510
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,280
want to see if it wants to get above

511
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,140
here because I could be wrong because it

512
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,320
may use this initial uh pump

513
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,960
to feed into that and tomorrow's read

514
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,220
announcement do something completely

515
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,799
opposed to what I've outlined and not

516
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,480
even come up here but I I think that

517
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,580
this is a likely draw on down

519
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,240
okay

520
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,580
I know I hear you bitching let me go

521
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,000
over here

522
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,460
there you go sorry

523
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,260
thank you I know

524
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,780
I was uh going through charts

525
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,600
and a few of you like to buried me about

526
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,940
not having the title bear I don't know

527
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,620
I don't know how they get untoggled I

528
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,280
don't

529
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,600
I don't usually mess with it

530
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,340
so we've had buy side here and sell side

531
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,360
taken

532
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,820
uh the initial draw let's go into a

533
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,299
moment chart

534
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,659
All in One Moment in one minute

535
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,260
the market opened here ran up just a

536
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,700
little bit above

537
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,340
the FVG then slam down the

538
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,780
take cell side and then in the same

539
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,360
minute one candle close up here after

540
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,280
running up the buy side so in one minute

541
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,880
look how much the market has traversed

542
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,220
now do you believe that you're going to

543
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,020
be nimble enough to trade in that when

544
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,460
the liquidity is already pulled anyway

545
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,380
your broker's not going to let you trade

546
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,340
that

547
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,260
okay you're not going to see these guys

548
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,780
out there that put a buy order and a

549
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,640
sell order unless they're running their

550
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,220
white list fake broker they're running

551
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,620
on their own scam those orders will get

552
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,360
filled because it's not really happening

553
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,419
but in the real Market none of that

554
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,220
works okay you're not going to be

555
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,080
allowed to be trading it it will not let

556
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,520
you fill so

557
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,720
as much as I love having fun and ripping

558
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,740
other people and I can take a good

559
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,080
ribbing too it's important that when it

560
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,679
matters when real discussions about risk

561
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,299
and money and the potential loss of it

562
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,520
I don't sugarcoat any of that so I'm

563
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,659
telling you if anybody's out there

564
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:40,799
showing you examples where they get

565
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
filled and they got a really good entry

566
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,580
here and they got out here that's total

567
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,559
grade A okay they didn't get

568
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
filled they didn't trade it and anybody

569
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,059
tells you otherwise okay the man they do

570
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,500
that and show you broker statements log

571
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,480
into their broker's account and show you

572
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,179
not mt4 or mt5 account because that's

573
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,960
 too a reputable broker

574
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,600
sorry but that that's just the facts

575
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,780
okay

576
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,460
I consider myself a little bit better

577
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,000
than the average bear and I don't

578
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,140
believe I can make my stuff work even in

579
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,539
these environments because it's highly

580
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,780
manipulated like you are absolutely up

581
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,080
against a brick wall and you can't you

582
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,299
won't be permitted period

583
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,059
because it moves so fast

584
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,279
Brokers can take because they ebook a

585
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,380
lot of people they could be wrong by

586
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,700
happenstance

587
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,580
and over leveraging Larry that can be in

588
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,520
there doing big big moves and get lucky

589
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
they have to they have to pay that out

590
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,779
because of the the fierceness and

591
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,100
velocity of how fast it moves around

592
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,900
you know it's that's just that's how the

593
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,659
business Works folks I mean you can be

594
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,299
mad about it or just understand that's

595
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,580
what takes place and respect it it's

596
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,140
okay I'm not going to play in that

597
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,100
sandbox I'll wait

598
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,779
so

599
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,140
this is literally a 50 50 now because

600
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,980
it's

601
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,779
it's taken both sides of the liquidity

602
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,179
after I drew your attention to

603
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,279
working off the Fairway Gap I mentioned

604
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,120
first now

605
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,980
the takeaway in this is I want you to

606
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,539
think about how we were looking at the

607
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,400
buy side and the sell side

608
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,380
forget right

609
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,779
forget being wrong forget profitability

610
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,580
think

611
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,500
okay think about this

612
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,779
all of the movement that took place thus

613
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,679
far

614
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,559
was all inside of a one minute basis or

615
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,940
two minutes

616
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,440
that's it

617
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
so all of this movement from here and

618
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,179
here

619
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,820
that happened in

620
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,740
oblinko nine

621
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,880
you would not have the the ability

622
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,860
if you didn't have limit orders in that

623
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,799
could be filled not that they would be

624
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,919
you wouldn't have the ability to adjust

625
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,200
or to comprehend what it is that you

626
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,539
should be doing next

627
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,640
especially if you're a new student or a

628
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,020
new Trader you have no idea what you're

629
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,860
doing

630
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,500
you have no idea where you would measure

631
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,260
a willingness to see continuation up or

632
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,580
down

633
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,960
maybe you didn't even know where these

634
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,220
pools of liquidity were before I

635
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,600
mentioned them

636
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
so if you don't know those things why

637
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,260
would you even Gamble

638
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,600
on this report that's coming out

639
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,940
or that's that came out six minutes or

640
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,840
so ago

641
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,059
it's important not to see these things

642
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,400
and see how much it moved and think to

643
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,140
yourself if I would have got a piece of

644
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,120
that that's not that kind of move

645
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,400
okay that's that's not what this is this

646
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,140
is a trap

647
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,960
this is a very

648
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,659
difficult thing to convey to to new

649
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,760
Traders or new students because they

650
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,340
think somebody absolutely bought the low

651
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,380
down here or in this area and then sold

652
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,480
it up here they believed that and I'm

653
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,179
telling you that didn't happen

654
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,980
if it happened they'll gladly go into

655
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,980
their broker account and log in live log

656
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,539
into it with their password blocked out

657
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,279
that's fine but go in there and show

658
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,080
their time and date and their time and

659
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,039
sales

660
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,419
Phils

661
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,580
on a reputable broker you're not going

662
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,820
to see that okay believe me folks if I

663
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,220
could do that in this report I would be

664
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,840
doing it every month every time it would

665
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,760
do it I would do that just to show you

666
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
you know this is the way it is

667
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,320
but I'm telling you up front because I

668
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,700
want to protect you

669
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,940
that this type of Market driver is

670
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,860
essentially

671
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,140
risking ruin

672
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,559
but we can identify and use it like I

673
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,260
teach to use the non-farm payroll okay

674
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,820
nonpartum payroll I don't trade that

675
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,779
report

676
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,059
you can trade after

677
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,980
the non-farm payroll report you can

678
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,100
trade after the CPI number

679
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,659
but ahead of it

680
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,159
no because you know you have no idea you

681
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,860
have no idea I have no idea

682
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,840
where it's going to go on their CPI

683
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,020
number

684
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
so what makes you think you do as a

685
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,860
green horn someone to just start a

686
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,779
couple months watching some videos from

687
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,820
me some yahoo that teaches with a demo

688
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,659
account you think you're going to be

689
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,340
able to beat this

690
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,840
no

691
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,880
don't do that you're going to create

692
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,700
Scar Tissue so what I did this morning I

693
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,279
outlined how to focus on what to look

694
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,559
for and what you would study

695
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,360
and in a minute or less

696
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,980
Drew out here's where the buy side is

697
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,320
why did I call this out look at the the

698
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,539
idea of it not wanting to go higher so

699
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,940
retail sees this as what strong

700
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,380
resistance

701
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,200
say they can be short in their mind

702
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,299
and the stop losses would be above these

703
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,440
highs here

704
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
in the form of buy stops that's what we

705
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,220
call buy side liquidity

706
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,480
I took you over here to the relative

707
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,220
equal lows what's going to be resting

708
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,620
below that sell stops which is why we

709
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,559
call that sell side liquidity

710
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,860
both sides of the marketplace are always

711
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,679
in contention for high impact news

712
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,960
drivers like CPI rate announcements

713
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,299
non-farm payroll those types of things

714
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,559
anytime you see in your lower time frame

715
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,580
charts

716
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,279
these smooth edges like this very very

717
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,080
smooth relative equal lows very very

718
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,020
smooth relative equal highs they are

719
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,419
going to be made Jagged meaning it's

720
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,799
going to rip through it like it does

721
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,659
over here so now they're not so smooth

722
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,700
already now if this this whole movement

723
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
down here

724
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,940
was a function

725
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,039
to offset

726
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,039
any positions or interest

727
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,220
because it controls sentiment as well

728
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,720
with orders resting below here

729
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,620
down here

730
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,840
I'm sorry up here rather down here where

731
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,779
to go the uh looking at the relative

732
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,880
equal highs the market ran for those as

733
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,679
well and then what has it done since

734
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,799
it's staying in between those two pools

735
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,679
of liquidity but what did it do first it

736
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,059
went right to the FVG I

737
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,620
mentioned overshot it by a little bit

738
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,419
which is understandable

739
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,340
given the nature of this report that

740
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,320
came out and then inside of all this

741
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
move it dropped down now you can't see

742
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,120
it like this so if I if I'm in a one

743
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,860
minute chart

744
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,460
here's the 830 candle it opens trades up

745
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,200
it looks like it completely rolls right

746
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,940
on through it

747
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,320
but

748
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
we saw momentarily before it ran up

749
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,720
higher it ran up to it here and stopped

750
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,179
right in here it stopped and then moved

751
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,320
lower

752
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
then came all the way back up and

753
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,860
overlapped the entire run and then went

754
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,520
to the buy saw

755
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,059
it to you owner

756
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,740
30 second chart here

757
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,100
opens rallies up drops down still

758
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,299
15 second chart

759
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,860
there's the move right there that's what

760
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,940
it looked like

761
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,980
it opened

762
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,419
ran up

763
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,640
this came to this big green candle here

764
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
didn't exist yet

765
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,840
watch the video okay when the live

766
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,580
stream code I don't know if I can you

767
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,659
rewind my

768
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,880
live streams I don't think I've disabled

769
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,100
that you should be able to rewind it and

770
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,500
then tap the live Tab and left hand

771
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,539
corner taking refactor where I'm at in

772
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,640
line but you can watch it where it opens

773
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,380
it trades up creates that short-term

774
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,360
High there then it runs for the sell

775
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,440
side

776
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,059
and then all in the same one minute

777
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,299
candle it opens here on this 15 second

778
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,039
candle and then runs for the buy side

779
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,580
then

780
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,679
now we're hanging around in here

781
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,559
so I think we could make a potential run

782
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,059
higher

783
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,000
to take out this high

784
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,860
this run down here looks a little

785
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,380
aggressive it feels like they went down

786
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,880
there

787
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,799
fastest

788
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,500
and then this

789
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,919
movement here this is a lot of that uh

790
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,480
run break retest go short I think

791
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,519
Traders are trying to go short from the

792
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,159
retail perspective and they would want

793
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,279
to reach up into this Wick here I would

794
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,559
observe and study with that idea in mind

795
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,059
that would look like this

796
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,220
it's not a trade folks it's just this is

797
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,360
what you're doing when you're reading

798
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,039
the tape it gives you experience

799
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,480
watching price action where you don't

800
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,059
push the button even in a demo you get a

801
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,740
feel for what price is likely to do you

802
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,080
spend a lot of time doing that

803
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,820
if

804
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,019
if I would have done that in the

805
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,580
beginning I would have spared myself

806
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,700
years of drawing down blowing accounts

807
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,220
and it would have been a lot faster for

808
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,340
me to find consistency so here's the

809
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
love I'm referring to

810
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,480
4407 and then 4405 even that's the

811
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,520
midpoint of this Gap here

812
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,139
okay so watch and see if they want to

813
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,859
draw up into that

814
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,399
uh the main takeaway what I was saying

815
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,099
was even in this fast Market move

816
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,080
the FVG I mentioned and the

817
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,899
liquidity pools it went to the fair Bay

818
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,300
Gap then dropped to the sell side then

819
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,520
ran for the buy side so the takeaway

820
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,739
would be even in that speed

821
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,440
okay of within one minute

822
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,199
the very levels that I gave you the

823
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,239
algorithm referred to immediately

824
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,418
in a way in a speed and a velocity that

825
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,659
even I can't participate in it so

826
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,760
the takeaway is for you to see that

827
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,460
they're even in this recklessness

828
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,500
that looks like chaos and just

829
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,099
Carnage

830
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,700
it's still being controlled

831
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,940
but it's being controlled in a way where

832
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,740
it's going to move a lot

833
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,619
in a short span of time but you're not

834
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,900
being permitted to profit during it

835
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,060
that's that's what I'm trying to convey

836
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,300
to you it's an illusion these types of

837
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,400
moves are the very things that draw

838
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
people into wanting to trade because

839
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,339
they think they can get in here and take

840
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,400
these trades and make your 20 30 Handles

841
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
in a minute

842
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,660
over leveraged and get a five figure

843
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,480
withdrawal so

844
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,820
don't fall for that trap

845
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,920
it's very very important you don't fall

846
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,579
for that trap

847
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,440
okay there's uh

848
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,820
they run into our consequent

849
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,839
Correctional mentioned they would draw

850
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,140
too

851
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,180
that's enough to pay your bills right

852
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,560
there folks

853
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,119
I know it doesn't seem like it's all

854
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,119
that sexy but that little mood right

855
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,440
there that's what a high frequency

856
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,060
trading algorithm does

857
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,240
it trades on that type of little move

858
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,380
hundreds of times per session

859
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,660
now look at the reaction of that

860
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,640
just that little move right there that

861
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,619
in itself is a high frequency trading

862
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,420
algorithm entry

863
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,220
it moves back and forth there's

864
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,780
algorithms that

865
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,640
trade one-sided they stay in a buy model

866
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,980
for buys or going along and there's

867
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,599
other high frequency trading algorithms

868
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,280
that trade on the sell side it's a sell

869
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
side model so it's only going short when

870
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,700
it's offering the opportunity to do so

871
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,400
and then you have a

872
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,740
a Model A high frequency trading

873
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,500
algorithm that simply goes all over the

874
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,900
place it takes whatever volatility is

875
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,240
available at the time and it runs up

876
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,820
down up down up down up down that's the

877
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,320
stuff because I get asked all the time

878
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,140
what is it that you won't teach us

879
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,700
it's that

880
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm not allowed to teach you that I'm

881
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,599
not going to teach that but I have

882
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,500
demonstrated it before in the past and

883
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,300
yeah I'm very candid about saying I'm

884
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,160
not going to teach that part to you

885
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,160
but you instead of saying look at how

886
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,720
much you've already taught and look how

887
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,160
much the impact has been for other

888
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,480
people they're making real money with it

889
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,560
now

890
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,680
um

891
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,079
the point of appreciation

892
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,660
is lost because

893
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,520
you forget everything I've already

894
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,160
shared openly and works amazingly well

895
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,680
and because I say I can't do something

896
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,960
like I can't folks I can't literally I

897
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,119
cannot I'm not permitted to do it

898
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,400
I would love to do it trust me I get

899
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,099
real close as close as I can and this

900
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,660
the students that really really really

901
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,880
want to know it they think that I hidden

902
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,760
it in my teachings I I did not

903
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,220
okay I did not teach anything like that

904
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,099
I'm not allowed to do it but you don't

905
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,079
need that all you need to do is find one

906
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,579
little multiplier one little thing that

907
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:06,960
gives you a setup

908
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,240
one little thing that gives you a reason

909
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,880
to engage the marketplace measure risk

910
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,140
Define it

911
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,820
that means know where your stop should

912
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,540
be

913
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,280
and then where you should take profits

914
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,500
partial and where you think term this is

915
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,079
where's your best case exit

916
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,660
sometimes my trades don't go to full

917
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,880
Terminus because I'm illustrating either

918
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,440
a

919
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,320
point of not needing to be 100 accurate

920
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,820
so that way it encourages you as my

921
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,760
students or sometimes as a human I just

922
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,560
don't do it correctly

923
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,619
or I'll take off more than I should have

924
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,839
in hindsight I'll look back and say I

925
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,160
wish I left a little bit more on the

926
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,839
trade that part is always going to be

927
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,700
there no matter how good you get at this

928
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,440
you're always going to be wrong even in

929
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,520
your winning trades you're going to wish

930
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,079
you would have had more

931
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,020
held on longer got out sooner

932
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,780
yeah it's it's always like that okay so

933
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,260
this craft that you're involved in now

934
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,680
is a lifestyle it's not you learn how to

935
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,300
make money and that's it you've reached

936
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,700
your destination excellence

937
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,940
is a Pursuit

938
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,700
it's not a

939
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,079
destination it's final it's always

940
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,240
always going to be something that you're

941
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,000
striving to do better and reach for

942
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,300
and mine is my x's and I've been open

943
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,460
about that as well I always want to make

944
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,800
them better because I have lots of ways

945
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,680
to get into things but I'm never fully

946
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,180
satisfied if I'm going to be honest with

947
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,180
you I'm never satisfied ever

948
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,180
with my exits and I have

949
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,060
got out on the highest tick a handful of

950
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,000
times and I got in and out of trades on

951
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,220
the lowest ticket a handful of times

952
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,540
but

953
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,400
you would think with 30 years

954
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,619
I I would have a whole lot more examples

955
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,380
I I don't because I'm either trying to

956
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,440
out think my algorithm or I'm trying to

957
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,160
find something that I haven't

958
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,380
identified yet

959
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,000
and because of those distractions my

960
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,980
mind's going a thousand miles an hour

961
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,859
it's hard for me to focus which is

962
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,420
another reason why I don't like to have

963
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,760
people chatting to me

964
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,560
and even when my son's next to me

965
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,119
they're not allowed to say anything to

966
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,000
me because that small little distraction

967
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,859
would like now like me pointing over to

968
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,040
him like it takes me off my train of

969
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,060
thought

970
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,740
and you have to especially for someone

971
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,619
like me I have to be very dialed in and

972
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm very easily distracted I'm like a

973
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,460
dog sees a squirrel like what what like

974
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,400
I can't focus so

975
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,980
maybe you don't have that uh

976
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,140
issue in your trading maybe you're you

977
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,460
can multitask

978
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,440
you know and and do exceedingly well

979
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
even as a Trader I don't have that skill

980
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,260
set I can't like I have to be 100 dialed

981
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,020
in because I have so many things that I

982
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,000
can see as an opportunity

983
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,980
see where is you you have one model or

984
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,660
two two things maybe three things that

985
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,760
you learn from me and if one of those

986
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,740
things occur it's easy for you to focus

987
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,380
okay I see this but you you have to

988
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,460
understand like I have 80 plus things

989
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,440
that are jumping off the chart at me

990
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,440
which one do I want to eat off of

991
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,300
I'm like a dog in a meat market turn

992
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,520
loose like do I want to run over there

993
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,960
and bite that do I want to run over here

994
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,180
and bite that like it that's the that's

995
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,800
the closest analogy I can give to you

996
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,320
like I hear so many things I can see as

997
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,820
an opportunity in price

998
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,240
whether it be a a three handle Run a 10

999
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,820
handle run a 15 handle run a run that

1000
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,619
goes eight handles reverses for four

1001
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,920
runs for 13. like those those things are

1002
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,079
jumping off the chart all the time to me

1003
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,200
and depend upon what my mind is focused

1004
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,900
on at the time or if I'm if I have a

1005
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,760
means of sitting down trying to explain

1006
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,680
something to an audience or if I'm doing

1007
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,839
a lecture or whatever or if I'm teaching

1008
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,140
my son

1009
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,820
whatever one I go with

1010
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,079
okay

1011
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,900
that's the one I go with and I'm always

1012
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,520
this is the part that you mean I'm

1013
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,339
saying I'm always regretful that I

1014
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,440
didn't do one or the other because I

1015
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
have so many of them to choose from you

1016
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,180
think that if I sat down and I divulged

1017
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,320
all of them to you that it's going to

1018
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,140
make you a better Trader it doesn't

1019
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,460
it's it's almost like

1020
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,180
well if you have more than one child

1021
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,780
which one's your your favorite

1022
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,640
you can't say which one's your favorite

1023
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,400
right but when you're in the market and

1024
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,420
you're trading and you're looking at

1025
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,359
Price action it is very difficult for me

1026
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,800
to say

1027
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,740
I love this one more than that one

1028
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,200
so whenever I come to the

1029
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,880
decision on this is the one I'm going to

1030
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,680
go with that's it but the whole time

1031
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,599
price is running

1032
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,520
I know my mind at certain times that the

1033
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,900
other one's going to do certain things

1034
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,900
and then price presents this certain

1035
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,700
thing that I would expect in that

1036
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,380
instance where that particular model to

1037
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,359
work for me to take an entry but I'm

1038
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,700
already in something

1039
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,440
I'm wrestling with that the whole time

1040
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,380
the Market's ticking that is such a

1041
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,660
distraction so imagine if that's what it

1042
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,119
was like for you so please if you're if

1043
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,160
you're upset with me because I'm been

1044
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,599
honest with you and told you I'm not

1045
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,099
going to teach you

1046
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,480
everything

1047
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,280
and it's not important for you to learn

1048
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,800
everything all you need is one thing

1049
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
just one thing

1050
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,300
and the most important thing is where

1051
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,280
price is going to go

1052
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,280
because literally like there's so many

1053
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,040
ways to get into a trade

1054
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,839
if you're right in where you where you

1055
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,700
think is going to go if you have that

1056
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,920
understood

1057
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
it makes it a lot easier

1058
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,460
and it allows you to hold on to your

1059
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,140
trade and you don't have the frustration

1060
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,300
you see many live streamers and they get

1061
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,920
in there and they make whatever they're

1062
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,440
making you know glad hand and Cherry you

1063
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,579
know not cherry pick but they'll be

1064
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,680
their chest and they're amazing this and

1065
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,540
that and the market just keeps on

1066
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,619
running

1067
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,300
and then they in the same live stream

1068
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,760
they're crying about how I gotta learn

1069
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,800
how to do this I gotta hold on hold on

1070
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,119
you got to spend more time understand

1071
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,099
where it's going to reach for and not

1072
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,140
just focus on these lower time frames

1073
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,599
in the lower time frames are wonderful

1074
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,599
for entry and in managing risk

1075
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,240
but if your trade is entirely

1076
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,300
linked to and found it on a lower time

1077
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,460
frame draw on liquidity you're missing

1078
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,380
the point entirely

1079
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,079
you're completely missing the entire

1080
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,000
focus of why you should be taking Trace

1081
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,359
you need movement folks as a Trader we

1082
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,140
need displacement and a change from one

1083
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,500
price to another over a duration of time

1084
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,180
how much time

1085
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,339
you have to you have to come to that

1086
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,040
conclusion what it fits for you for some

1087
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,140
of you holding overnight it can't happen

1088
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,599
you won't let yourself do that others

1089
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,400
you can't be in a trade longer than 10

1090
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,420
minutes

1091
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,920
in 10 minutes is long-term position

1092
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,240
trading to you

1093
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,800
and I'm not saying that that's a bad

1094
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,640
thing because if you decide on what your

1095
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,040
main comfort zone is

1096
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,839
how long can you hold a trade before you

1097
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,520
start getting antsy

1098
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,460
if you're really really impatient

1099
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,520
and you can't overcome impatience then

1100
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,859
you will do very very well in intraday

1101
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,240
charts working with one minute time

1102
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,579
frames and you can get your setups in

1103
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,400
one minute bars get it be done and stop

1104
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,980
trading for the day go do something else

1105
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,920
and you would probably be very very

1106
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,380
profitable doing that

1107
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,640
but

1108
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,819
will you be comfortable seeing these 30

1109
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,760
handle runs that happen over the span of

1110
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,460
the entire daily range how about 100

1111
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,500
handle moves or a thousand handle plus

1112
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,359
moves that I've just outlined in NASDAQ

1113
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,819
over the last month or so

1114
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,619
are you going to be regretful about that

1115
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,359
and let that beat you up that's it's

1116
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,680
very important that you understand these

1117
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,300
things and when I got into trading I

1118
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,740
didn't know those things

1119
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,599
we're going to be barriers

1120
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,400
they're going to be speed bumps to you

1121
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,280
and sometimes roadblocks for others

1122
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,480
for you finding your success

1123
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,940
I don't know why somebody need to hear

1124
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,160
that that's why I said it so

1125
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,020
let me drop these on here for reference

1126
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,880
and move this fit because it's a little

1127
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,359
too much

1128
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,020
all right so again this is a 15 second

1129
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,119
chart you probably don't have that

1130
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,940
on your trading view but you're watching

1131
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,540
it online

1132
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,359
so what would a high frequency trading

1133
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,800
algorithm entry be on a buy model high

1134
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,920
frequency trading algorithm

1135
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,500
you can see very plainly that I outlined

1136
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,119
that we would likely draw up into the

1137
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,619
consequent encroachment of this Wick

1138
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,520
here on the 15 second chart

1139
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,319
and then potentially draw to here now

1140
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,000
the draw I'm thinking is up here because

1141
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,720
it's it's going to move on the folks

1142
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,599
that see this as a high low

1143
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,540
break and retest and try to go lower

1144
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,819
that's that's what the algorithm is

1145
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,460
running on it's already ran to the the

1146
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,380
majority of

1147
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,300
the position holders here because their

1148
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,400
spot would have been right above here

1149
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,780
not because you're looking at a 15

1150
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,079
second chart because they're looking at

1151
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,420
Dom's depth of Market they're reading

1152
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,240
all these types of things okay and those

1153
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,540
gimmicks are they're not helpful you

1154
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,579
believe they are I promise you that you

1155
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,319
have a religion

1156
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,680
it's faith-based on that stuff being the

1157
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,180
Catalyst as the why markets growing up

1158
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,099
or down it's not

1159
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,040
to the short holders that would use this

1160
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,200
as a short

1161
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,359
this run into this inefficiency right

1162
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:07,619
there

1163
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,540
into this order block that's a trade

1164
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,700
it's a hyper entry trading algorithm but

1165
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,619
that's for the sell side

1166
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,420
I mentioned when we got into our time

1167
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,040
frames before we dropped into the second

1168
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,780
chart I said that you know I believe

1169
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,599
that we're gonna move higher and I gave

1170
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,099
you the outline as to why I believe that

1171
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,160
based on these second charts

1172
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,960
so

1173
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,180
Folks at like Goldman Sachs will tell

1174
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,500
you that there's noise on these lower

1175
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,359
time frames and if anybody tells you

1176
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,579
they can find trades in this or find

1177
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,079
profitability in it run away from them

1178
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,760
they're coming and I assure you I

1179
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,400
promise you but how many times have you

1180
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,319
sat here with me on Livestream and the

1181
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,780
dances to my record so

1182
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,180
the opening here it trades down into

1183
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,500
that

1184
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,380
and then we have a short-term High

1185
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,359
it's broken to the upside

1186
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,339
so now think for a moment

1187
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:00,060
your mindset is I'm strapped in

1188
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,640
I'm in the saddle I'm only running for

1189
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,460
buy side so the high frequency trading

1190
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,140
algorithm that you would be studying in

1191
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,880
this practical in this this type of

1192
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,280
price action would be only looking for

1193
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,400
Longs or only looking for buys okay and

1194
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,319
how could you use that well what have I

1195
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,460
taught you

1196
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,980
what was what were the what were the

1197
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,540
signatures that you've understood so far

1198
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,579
about what price uses to go higher

1199
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,200
you have to have a shift in Market

1200
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,819
structure

1201
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:32,880
here you have a swing High it rallies

1202
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,819
through it on this candle right there

1203
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:39,300
it runs higher that's fine but what does

1204
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,880
it leave small little inefficiency right

1205
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,859
there

1206
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,960
and just ran our Target there

1207
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,880
that's it but that's it right there that

1208
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,859
is all you need folks what you just

1209
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,420
watched me outline here

1210
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,579
I told you the direction I favored I

1211
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,920
told you what it was likely to do

1212
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,680
and I'm using a 15 second chart tell me

1213
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,760
somebody else out there that's wrote

1214
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,200
books made courses with a 15 second

1215
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,579
chart and can tell you how it's going to

1216
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,319
act and behave like this

1217
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,839
it doesn't happen

1218
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,880
so a order block

1219
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,920
okay is a change in the state of

1220
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,119
delivery

1221
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,119
okay it is not a Zone

1222
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,040
it is not every down closed candle that

1223
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,599
is an overblock it is not an up close

1224
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,240
candle every single one is an odor block

1225
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,020
it is a frame of reference

1226
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,079
where a change

1227
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,780
in where price will be drawn to or from

1228
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,060
that occurs here why am I using this

1229
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,859
down closed candle and not this one over

1230
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:38,819
here

1231
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,400
this one has the larger body so it's

1232
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,800
spent more time and recorded more time

1233
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,220
and duration at its extremes

1234
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,020
that lowest close that makes this an

1235
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,380
order block

1236
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,359
this swing high that it's part of when

1237
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:56,579
it trades above it here that's a shift

1238
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,920
in Market structure so that means high

1239
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,520
frequency trading algorithms will trip

1240
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,460
to buy side and they'll all be looking

1241
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,660
primarily

1242
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,480
for their largest leverage to be on this

1243
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,859
side of the marketplace

1244
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,500
now the chaos high frequency trading

1245
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,420
algorithms that trade up and down all

1246
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,339
day long

1247
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:18,900
they'll take this trade too but they'll

1248
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,880
also take this shortness very bad Gap

1249
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,740
here that trades to it and trade back

1250
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,000
down into this

1251
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,980
inefficiency and change in the state

1252
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,240
delivery which is that opening price

1253
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,000
don't believe me look

1254
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,020
here's the opening price

1255
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,660
he'll never call this stuff live you'll

1256
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,940
never see him do it folks

1257
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,980
yeah I'll do it with a 15 second chart

1258
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,200
just to rub it in your face the opening

1259
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,339
price

1260
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,859
for everybody Gap how do you qualify a

1261
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,020
high probability order block it will

1262
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,079
have my FVG

1263
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,540
not every down closed candle use an

1264
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,099
orange block

1265
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,040
not every down closed candle with a fair

1266
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,220
value Gap like this is a long

1267
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,559
wait that's a contradiction no that's a

1268
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,819
refinement

1269
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:09,359
I'm teaching you narrative logic

1270
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,880
framework

1271
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,940
the fact that we had this idea here what

1272
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,099
was the first side of liquidity taken at

1273
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,540
CPI

1274
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,520
we opened here

1275
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,640
at 8 30. it opened rallied up here

1276
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,460
stopped short then went down below to

1277
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,920
take the buy side I'm sorry to sell side

1278
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,260
so what side the marketplace did the

1279
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,140
algorithm run to first what do smart

1280
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,819
money Players the folks that don't write

1281
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,559
books that aren't going to be talking to

1282
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,540
you I'm it

1283
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,280
I'm the one that stepped out I'm not

1284
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,660
supposed to be doing these things not

1285
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,980
you're not supposed to know these things

1286
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,740
so I had to create a language

1287
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,359
so that way if I'm tapped on the

1288
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,240
shoulder again I am teaching this I'm

1289
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,700
not teaching that

1290
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,760
it's Pepsi or Coke they're they're both

1291
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,000
colas they're both poison okay but you

1292
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,900
have a choice so you have what

1293
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,780
a delivery to sell side burst

1294
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,180
so smart money the folks that understand

1295
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,520
the algorithm the folks that follow it

1296
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,079
it's lead

1297
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,140
wait for this signature here

1298
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,160
because the first

1299
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,599
that tells you the direction

1300
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,640
because they're going to run for cell

1301
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,020
Cipher so this is the reason why I told

1302
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,400
you I believe it's going to go up here

1303
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,559
how did you know that ICT how did you

1304
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,000
know it's going to go higher why did you

1305
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,339
why did you pick that why Why didn't it

1306
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,599
want to come back down to consequent

1307
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,980
encroaching of this week that's what

1308
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,000
some of you are probably thinking right

1309
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,680
now

1310
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,099
holy crow he just read my mind

1311
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,359
you're looking around the room right now

1312
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,180
for microphones aren't you I bugged your

1313
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,920
uh computer right

1314
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,839
I'm hacking your system up the ghost

1315
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,819
machine

1316
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,140
it doesn't need to go down to the

1317
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,579
consequent encroaching of this because

1318
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,220
the narrative is it ran for sell side

1319
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,900
and then quickly repriced away from it

1320
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,760
it does not need to come back down here

1321
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,520
before it goes up to the buy side and

1322
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,240
how it delivers listen folks how it

1323
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,040
delivers price after

1324
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,260
the second pool of liquidity is engaged

1325
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,020
sell side was below here I'll go back up

1326
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,400
to the higher time frames in a moment

1327
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,220
for now I have to outline all this the

1328
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,980
cell side was taken first

1329
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,020
that means the move

1330
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,599
will be likely prolonged

1331
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,540
and much more prominent to the buy side

1332
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,059
that means it's going to go higher it

1333
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,180
upsets the orders and sentiment by this

1334
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,619
drop down here

1335
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,740
then it runs for the buy side

1336
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,559
it breaks lower comes back up and then

1337
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,800
creates a false shorting opportunity

1338
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,220
it delivers a short run Traders see that

1339
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,960
that we're short they thinking yeah wow

1340
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,640
you know I got

1341
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,160
four handles five handles or so I'm

1342
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,900
getting ready to take out that low down

1343
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,160
here it's going to keep going for the

1344
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,300
rest of the day lower

1345
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,099
wrong

1346
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,020
it only reprices to the opening price

1347
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,579
here at 8 30.

1348
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,280
and also you just can't accept it but

1349
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,220
it's all controlled opening price trades

1350
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,079
down look at the bodies they tell you

1351
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,359
the story

1352
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,460
the Wicks did the damage

1353
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,440
the body stops right at the opening

1354
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,220
price

1355
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,339
at 8 30. the algorithm receives that

1356
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,619
as information comes back down to it

1357
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,500
there it stops on a dime turns around

1358
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,000
creates your short-term shift in Market

1359
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,099
structure there down close candle

1360
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,319
bullish order block

1361
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:40,200
separation here

1362
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,119
come back down into it hit the order

1363
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,760
block respect it close in the

1364
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,319
inefficiency

1365
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,180
time distortion

1366
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,819
all this movement here as long as we're

1367
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:53,280
not breaking below the midpoint of this

1368
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,559
down closed candle everything's still a

1369
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:56,700
go

1370
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,920
what I'm looking at is this range from

1371
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,839
this high of this candle down to that

1372
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,880
low as long as these two candle

1373
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,339
reference points here have not been

1374
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:08,220
breached above or below all this stuff

1375
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,920
in here I'm ignoring every bit of it

1376
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,599
I'm not looking at any FVG

1377
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,460
inside of that I'm not looking at any

1378
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,260
kind of potential order block because

1379
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,059
this range here

1380
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:20,880
that's your dealing range it will not be

1381
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,559
anything of any importance or

1382
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,420
significance unless it trades outside of

1383
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,579
that range and because I'm telling you

1384
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,559
and as I told you live here I believe

1385
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,599
it's going to go higher and take out the

1386
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,640
high the first draw is here and the buy

1387
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,440
side above this High here

1388
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,900
so all these candles from this green

1389
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,540
candle right above my cursor

1390
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,140
all the way until we get to this

1391
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,500
candle's High right there so this candle

1392
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,660
all through

1393
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,400
till here

1394
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,099
means nothing to me

1395
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:55,079
I'm not looking any of those candles and

1396
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,579
having any respect of anything it's

1397
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,839
doing because the return from this

1398
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:04,619
Fairway Gap here let me draw it out

1399
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:07,680
This is complicated ICT I just want to

1400
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,420
over about oversolding okay I'm not your

1401
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,940
man then go go watch somebody else

1402
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,440
but you want to understand why the

1403
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,000
Market's doing what it's doing

1404
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,619
and you can trust and sleep at night

1405
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:17,760
that you know that the stuff that you're

1406
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,980
learning isn't going to stop

1407
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,200
it's never going to be beaten up or

1408
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,000
victimized by anything better is there

1409
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,160
anything better this is the market I'm

1410
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,559
teaching you the market

1411
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,720
the market rallies up into

1412
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,640
the inefficiency again

1413
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,339
And Trades down only to offer delivery

1414
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:36,900
to the order block close the

1415
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,960
inefficiency and then time is spent

1416
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,880
marking time that's it it's we're in 15

1417
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,440
second candles

1418
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,119
so it's just hanging around what is it

1419
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,280
doing

1420
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,260
what do you think is occurring inside of

1421
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,660
all these ranges in here between this

1422
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,460
candle is high and this candle is low

1423
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,940
that's all one older block

1424
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,859
what kind of order block propulsion

1425
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:00,300
block

1426
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,400
look at month 4 content on my YouTube

1427
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,020
channel

1428
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,119
because it all of this price action from

1429
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,280
this candle below my cursor all the way

1430
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,900
over to here

1431
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,420
all these candles are inside this

1432
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,359
so my mindset in focus is inside this

1433
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,099
range everything is happening inside I

1434
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,720
could care less because my mind is

1435
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,099
already established what the algorithm

1436
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:21,420
is going to refer back to is this

1437
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,700
signature here I've coded

1438
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,160
so all of this price action here is

1439
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,040
irrelevant it's just marking time where

1440
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,260
prices moved in that interval the

1441
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,400
highest and the lowest in the beginning

1442
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,619
and the ending that's all it's doing but

1443
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,680
my mind as a Trader and the analyst is

1444
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,480
I'm looking at inside this range here I

1445
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,220
want to see this range maintain itself

1446
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,960
and then eventually break to the upside

1447
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,079
which we get right there

1448
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,579
where does it draw to

1449
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:50,160
where I told you here and then what does

1450
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,319
it do it stops and then consolidates

1451
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,720
what's it doing

1452
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,160
what is it doing folks think

1453
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,859
the order block it trades down to it

1454
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:04,980
it's spending time down here

1455
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,599
for Traders that understand what I'm

1456
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,700
teaching you that they're not going to

1457
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,780
go out there in public and raise their

1458
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,540
hand say you know yeah ICT you know is

1459
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,280
right you know this is what we do they

1460
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,799
don't want me teaching it to you

1461
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,599
trust me they don't want me teaching

1462
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:19,619
this

1463
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:23,099
so I it took a great deal of prayer and

1464
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:26,280
answered prayer to have this shown to me

1465
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,200
in charts so that way I can convey what

1466
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,960
it is that's happening outside the chart

1467
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,240
the algorithm is not

1468
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,400
only doing what I'm showing you in

1469
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,559
candlesticks there are other things that

1470
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,720
I know that I can't teach because

1471
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,579
there's no way for me to bridge that gap

1472
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,160
between what you can see in a chart

1473
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,280
like I can't I can't say okay if it does

1474
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,960
this this is what it doesn't work like

1475
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,720
that so there's only a limitation of

1476
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,460
what it is I'm willing to share with you

1477
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,440
and you have to be

1478
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,480
content with that

1479
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,700
but I promise you if you just take a

1480
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,839
step back and look at what is I'm

1481
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:03,319
showing you it's light years

1482
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:07,260
way way way Beyond everything else

1483
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,299
you don't need to have this much degree

1484
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:10,380
of understanding but what do you think

1485
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,780
is occurring in here the algorithm is

1486
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,099
allowing time for Traders that are in

1487
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,960
the know that are real smart money

1488
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,760
they're not Wyckoff Traders they're not

1489
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,200
supplying demand guys they're not

1490
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,880
Goldman Sachs guys

1491
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,140
okay

1492
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,960
they don't know this stuff I promise you

1493
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,980
they don't know this

1494
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,880
it's allowing them to get their orders

1495
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,640
in before the algorithm reprices

1496
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,740
then it goes to your first point of

1497
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,940
reference which is the consequent

1498
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,960
encroachment this Wick here

1499
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,540
stops and then spends time

1500
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,640
what's it doing

1501
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,020
allowing them to build a larger position

1502
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,240
what's the model where where's price

1503
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,440
being drawn to higher

1504
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,960
so allows them to accumulate more Longs

1505
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,000
and then as it runs up

1506
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,460
they're Distributing it all their

1507
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,619
initial entries in here they're selling

1508
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,480
it some in here and then new algorithm

1509
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,160
entries

1510
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,420
are in here

1511
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,280
killing more

1512
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,140
and as it runs up they sell sell sell

1513
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,880
sell sell sell and that provides

1514
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,359
liquidity

1515
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,020
so there's this dance that's always

1516
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,220
occurring

1517
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,799
between inefficiencies and liquidity

1518
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:27,839
premium to Discount discounted premium

1519
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,359
always that's what's current it has

1520
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:32,400
nothing to do with harmonics has nothing

1521
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,920
to do with animal patterns has

1522
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,900
nothing to do with Elliott wave has

1523
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,660
nothing to do with anything that you see

1524
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,359
in a retail book price is not moving on

1525
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:44,339
any of that

1526
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:46,200
that's not what's going on folks in

1527
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
buying and selling pressure is not it

1528
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,660
that is not it

1529
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:56,460
your Market profile your volume bar is

1530
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,619
turned vertical okay so you're you're

1531
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,020
looking at them over here okay you're

1532
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,160
looking at that and you're looking at

1533
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,900
level two data and you think that that

1534
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,420
makes you smart or that makes you

1535
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,520
in the know

1536
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,579
that is a gimmick it's a red herring

1537
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,859
you're looking at stuff and you're not

1538
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:17,240
seeing the things I'm showing you

1539
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,740
I'm showing it to you in a 15 second

1540
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,880
chart think about it 15 seconds

1541
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,460
prices behaving in a way in which it's

1542
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,280
been coded it's behaving

1543
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,799
as it's told

1544
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:33,960
it's not being pushed around because

1545
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,900
buyers and sellers

1546
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,180
that's not what's occurring here folks

1547
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,220
sorry if that hurt your feelings I'm

1548
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,020
sure some of you worked in an industry

1549
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,700
and you feel like you know you're you're

1550
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,460
part of the team and all but you know

1551
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,079
you have a title

1552
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,819
that you have an ignorance you have no

1553
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:55,140
idea what makes these Mars go up and

1554
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,640
down

1555
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,280
and I'm not I don't care about titles

1556
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,920
so one minute

1557
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,839
here we have it

1558
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,720
opening price we trade down to it here

1559
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,660
rally up

1560
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,339
consolidate around

1561
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:12,900
what's it working in here on the one

1562
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,700
minute chart

1563
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,660
main threshold

1564
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,180
rally

1565
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,740
consolidate

1566
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,540
allow smart trade smart money to

1567
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,880
accumulate more longs

1568
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,740
and displace into the upside now look

1569
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,240
what's occurring here we're getting

1570
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,740
short-term highs

1571
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,740
we run above it short term High run

1572
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,660
above it when it starts doing this and

1573
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,460
you watch me do this many times and I

1574
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,440
just did it again yesterday in my trade

1575
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,480
for ES

1576
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,099
when it starts creating these short-term

1577
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,480
highs every time it runs above that in

1578
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,460
your long high frequency trading

1579
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,799
algorithms are dumping portions of their

1580
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:53,400
position above that that's why I do it

1581
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,119
okay I'm in there doing the same thing

1582
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,359
that these entities are told to do when

1583
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:02,880
they work with this algorithm and if

1584
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,400
they're doing it

1585
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,680
they're doing it because it's a purpose

1586
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,680
in mind they're offset distribution

1587
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,960
if they had accumulated long positions

1588
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,799
in here and in here how do they

1589
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,540
how do they exit

1590
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:23,940
short-term highs move away from it above

1591
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,280
that high is going to be by side

1592
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,400
sell to this buy side

1593
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,260
creates a short-term high retraces back

1594
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,599
down increasing short-term High when it

1595
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,880
runs above it again sell offset

1596
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,160
distribute offset

1597
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,319
they're long positions and distribute

1598
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,839
them to willing buyers

1599
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,520
where are the Willing buyers above

1600
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,020
market price

1601
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,579
every time you create a short-term High

1602
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,520
somebody in there some Joker okay some

1603
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,380
clown that there believes that Elliott

1604
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,819
leaves and animal patterns move the

1605
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:55,319
market around they're in there trying to

1606
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,480
trade their little gimmicks and they're

1607
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,099
trying to go short

1608
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,480
so if they're going short they're going

1609
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,799
to try to do what they're going to use

1610
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:04,079
an order that they think is protective a

1611
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,059
short position they use a buy stop where

1612
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:07,380
are they going to place that buy stock

1613
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,180
above the recent swing High

1614
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:14,520
so using narrative

1615
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,740
reading where price is going to go

1616
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,260
why it should go there when it will

1617
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,240
consolidate and pause

1618
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,940
I've taught you that live today

1619
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,740
I've taught you I've literally sat down

1620
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,920
here with you and told you now did I

1621
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,900
tell you

1622
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,119
exactly how to do it right before CPI no

1623
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,859
because I have to wait and see what it

1624
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,960
does what does it leave

1625
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,359
it leaves Clues all the time but I have

1626
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,339
to wait to see what it will run for

1627
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,380
I can't call the high and the low of the

1628
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,480
day until midnight

1629
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,000
in New York

1630
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,400
but if I'm doing analysis and I'm

1631
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,420
talking to someone they say hey what do

1632
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,200
you think about this and what do you

1633
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,619
think about that

1634
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,220
if I don't have the reference points

1635
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,500
that's required at midnight

1636
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,839
I can only talk about what I know based

1637
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,579
on the information that's being shown in

1638
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:07,079
the information that we have available

1639
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,799
at that time

1640
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,359
when we have these high impact or medium

1641
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,920
impact drivers that come out in the

1642
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,260
marketplace

1643
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,839
I have to wait for the potential for

1644
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:20,640
manual intervention manual intervention

1645
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,980
is here

1646
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,740
we initially opened ran above the fair

1647
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,859
value then dropped for sell signs so

1648
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,140
think about what I taught you we

1649
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,660
outlined real time before the market

1650
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,640
delivered where the liquidity would be

1651
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,440
and the inefficiency that would be

1652
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,980
utilized

1653
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,740
it opened ran up just above it let's go

1654
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,940
back down to the 15 second chart

1655
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:52,980
oops I gotta change it oh yeah

1656
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,520
that

1657
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,020
we opened rallied above that fair value

1658
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,000
Gap I outlined

1659
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,700
then ran for the sell side then it

1660
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,819
ripped higher for the buy sign

1661
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:11,160
the fact that it ran to the fair bag Gap

1662
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,160
here then to the sell side in itself if

1663
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,020
it was not a high impact news driver

1664
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,099
like this

1665
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,020
that type of run would have happened

1666
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,680
over the morning session

1667
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,319
and a later run in the afternoon would

1668
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:26,760
have been this move here at the buy side

1669
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,420
but because of the removal of liquidity

1670
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,339
believe me there are people that want to

1671
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,980
trade this but Brokers and liquidity

1672
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,440
providers they pull

1673
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,799
access away from the marketplace that's

1674
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,520
intervention that's manipulation that is

1675
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,559
a barrier to you being profitable

1676
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,720
whether you like it or not it's gonna

1677
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,520
happen and that's what they do around

1678
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,559
non-farm payroll too

1679
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,619
and they say oh there's a there's a an

1680
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,240
absence of liquidity not because it's

1681
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,400
organic believe me there's people that

1682
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,480
want to trade they think they're going

1683
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,299
to have something that is profitable

1684
01:08:03,299 --> 01:08:05,339
during this whole move

1685
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:07,079
they created some kind of thing with a

1686
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,539
moving average crossover

1687
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:10,740
and they want to trade it they believe

1688
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,720
it's going to make them rich

1689
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,080
no it's prevented because these types of

1690
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,960
moves offer a lot of movement in a very

1691
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,640
short span of time and somebody could be

1692
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,479
really wrong by by accident make a lot

1693
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,179
of movement in terms of profit in the

1694
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:29,100
broker if they're be booking them they

1695
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,080
have to take that hit they don't want

1696
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,920
that

1697
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,479
that's the reality of this business

1698
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:34,979
folks okay they're not going to come out

1699
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,540
and say yeah that's right it's true

1700
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,560
you're going to hear people come out and

1701
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,179
say oh he's full of he's a liar

1702
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:40,738
who's out here showing you what the

1703
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:41,939
Market's going to do in a 15 second

1704
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:42,859
chart

1705
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:46,859
you gotta look man if someone is saying

1706
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,960
something and they can't bring it and

1707
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,179
show receipts then okay then then don't

1708
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:52,620
trust that person

1709
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,060
but if someone's willing to sit out here

1710
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,339
live and explain all the mechanics

1711
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:57,960
before it happens

1712
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,520
either they know what they're talking

1713
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,620
about or they had something to do with

1714
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,339
it

1715
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:05,219
and I'd leave that up to you you decide

1716
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:08,040
if I'm full of you'll know if I'm

1717
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,819
not you'll know

1718
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,319
but after the fact

1719
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,600
how we treated what was the first pool

1720
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,759
Equity that was written the sell side

1721
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,000
now think about if you were long

1722
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,880
or any Trader that was long

1723
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,339
if this report ran down and hit that

1724
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:28,859
stop loss would you be willing to get

1725
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,660
back in to go along

1726
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,460
be honest now

1727
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,160
chances are no you wouldn't and that's

1728
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,020
why they do it

1729
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,719
they run for the liquidity on the side

1730
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:42,660
that they don't want to want

1731
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,060
oh no let me say it right they run for

1732
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,339
the liquidity first on the side that

1733
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:51,238
they want to make sure they scare out of

1734
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,679
entering and being

1735
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:55,380
on the right side so it's the first run

1736
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,020
on liquidity on medium or high impact

1737
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,260
news drivers that tends to be the side

1738
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,480
that would be the winning side if they

1739
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,219
wait

1740
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:08,400
then you see the buy side taken after

1741
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,860
but you have to wait you have to wait

1742
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,719
what does it want to do it pulls back

1743
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,219
inside the range what range between the

1744
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:15,960
two pools of liquidity that's this line

1745
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,120
here and this line here let me thicken

1746
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,159
them up

1747
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,360
foreign

1748
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,460
if you're on Twitter and you follow me

1749
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,739
on Twitter if you like what I'm teaching

1750
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,239
and this is resonating with you give me

1751
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,659
a hell yeah

1752
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,719
like the cuss to say heck yeah

1753
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:35,640
okay so these these two reference points

1754
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,380
that's their that's your range okay so

1755
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,140
after took the cell side out and then by

1756
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,840
side it pulled back into the range

1757
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,179
now both of those pools of liquidity

1758
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,760
Define a very specific range for

1759
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,340
liquidity purposes we outlined buy side

1760
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,260
was above here and sell side was below

1761
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,580
here

1762
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,980
the algorithm knows both those points of

1763
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,420
reference just like I showed it to you

1764
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,800
live before it was being used

1765
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,219
where'd it go to

1766
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,940
consequent encouragement

1767
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,780
right in the middle

1768
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,540
range Low Range High liquidity above it

1769
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,460
liquidity below it

1770
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,080
pulls back to consequent encroachment

1771
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,360
the bias I gave you is going higher

1772
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,699
would it reach for the first draw here

1773
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,440
and then we wait does it want to take

1774
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,179
the buy side here

1775
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,860
then we went into

1776
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,280
high high high

1777
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,400
what I tell you offset distribution

1778
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,620
algorithm starts selling and offsetting

1779
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,900
their long position and every time it

1780
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,400
takes out a high they're doing that

1781
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,320
distribution they're selling to those

1782
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,480
buy stops

1783
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,280
what did it do after that

1784
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,360
we're off the highs

1785
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,659
listen folks

1786
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,679
I don't know what you call foresight

1787
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,920
versus cherry picking okay I don't know

1788
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,840
where you're from what your culture is

1789
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,340
and beliefs about things but when

1790
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,840
someone says something and it

1791
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,540
happens it's it's pretty set in stone

1792
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,699
that either it works or it doesn't and

1793
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:22,500
if you can't see this

1794
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,600
like really there's nothing else there's

1795
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,460
nothing else I can do

1796
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,900
that make you understand that these

1797
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,460
things are driven

1798
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,940
100 controlled

1799
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,640
well one minute chart

1800
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,440
take this film off here

1801
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,800
so in all this business notice that uh

1802
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,440
this Wick here

1803
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,659
I went inside the range between that

1804
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,699
high and that

1805
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,140
close

1806
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,300
with that 15 second chart

1807
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,060
so you might have a measurement of

1808
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,000
consequent encroaching on this Wick here

1809
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,580
that's fine but in Nest Wick I want to

1810
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,260
be in the lower time frame very very

1811
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,940
small time frames

1812
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,300
and I just showed you Precision with 15

1813
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,460
second charts

1814
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,980
I told you how to omit

1815
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,100
and don't even refer to specific candles

1816
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,360
that's

1817
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,920
that's one of the arguments that people

1818
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,179
will say

1819
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:26,280
they'll say hey uh you know time based

1820
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,260
charts or nonsense they're garbage you

1821
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,580
know this that that's someone that

1822
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,659
doesn't believe number one there's a

1823
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:33,120
nail Rhythm too doesn't believe

1824
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,820
that you can use the element of time as

1825
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,100
the most influential factor in price

1826
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,440
delivery because everything around price

1827
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,500
delivery is first controlled

1828
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,100
and delivered by a schedule it's time

1829
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,760
it's time and price Theory

1830
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,719
time and price Theory not price and some

1831
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,219
gimmicks

1832
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:59,219
okay I know how to use a time-based

1833
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,620
chart because I know time

1834
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,179
I know the time when the algorithm is

1835
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:04,920
going to behave I know what it's likely

1836
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,120
to follow

1837
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,159
and then I also know how to Omit certain

1838
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,540
candles don't pay attention to certain

1839
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,739
ones

1840
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:15,540
and that's the Folly that I see people

1841
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,100
over the years they've taken things in

1842
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,719
look at this older blocks don't work

1843
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,040
because they'll point to down closed

1844
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,239
candles that aren't being respected you

1845
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,500
have no idea what an order block is

1846
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,060
and the folks that are making YouTube

1847
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,100
videos

1848
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,199
the simple way of using order blocks the

1849
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,699
best order block you don't know what an

1850
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,199
order block is take those videos down

1851
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:37,500
it's embarrassing stop okay seriously

1852
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,679
stop

1853
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,600
all right so I wanna

1854
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,880
ask you point blank

1855
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,880
if you see

1856
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,040
a reason to be accumulating a long

1857
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,659
position in here

1858
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:57,780
and in here and the market gives you

1859
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,320
all the signatures in here

1860
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,000
we understand this this pattern here is

1861
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,179
a three drives pattern or as Linda Rask

1862
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:08,580
and Larry Connors wrote in their book

1863
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,440
Street smarts which I love and adore

1864
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,060
that book not everything in that book I

1865
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,580
subscribe to but it was one of the very

1866
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,580
influential

1867
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,500
manuscripts that taught me how to view

1868
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,239
stop hunts

1869
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,320
like that that book rung in the first

1870
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,960
introduction to

1871
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,480
victimizing Traders

1872
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,340
where when I got stopped out I just said

1873
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,100
well you know that system didn't work or

1874
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,020
I did it wrong and I would beat myself

1875
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,260
up emotionally and psychologically and

1876
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,659
wreck myself you know constantly about

1877
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:48,420
how I did that wrong not knowing that

1878
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,040
one of the primary functions of the

1879
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,380
market is to go to where liquidity is

1880
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,000
and if you're wrong obviously you know

1881
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,460
you're the liquidity so when I first

1882
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,199
started that's how it was for me and

1883
01:15:58,199 --> 01:15:59,760
maybe that's where you're at in your

1884
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,739
development right now maybe you're

1885
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,140
you're struggling because every time you

1886
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,540
participate maybe sooner than you should

1887
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,640
even with the demo you're getting

1888
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,840
stopped out and you're getting

1889
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,020
frustrated and just know that I went

1890
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,420
through that for years

1891
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,880
I know you see the things that I do and

1892
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,920
teach and show and call in them real

1893
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,380
time too and there's it can't be a time

1894
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,960
when ICT was a noob there was

1895
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,840
there really was and I was the poster

1896
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,300
boy for it like I blew accounts like

1897
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,060
crazy I did it in stunning fashion okay

1898
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,760
if you're gonna do it and do it right I

1899
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,320
was the that was the best one at doing

1900
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,480
it every possible thing that would have

1901
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,640
caused me to blow an account I did it

1902
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,360
recklessness greed impatience

1903
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,440
um system hopping testing stupidity

1904
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,940
seeing if certain things that you know I

1905
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,420
had a hunch about none of it was helpful

1906
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,060
and then because of the pain of losing

1907
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,020
money

1908
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,840
and the ideas that initially came from

1909
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,260
Larry Williams you know his uh

1910
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,480
uh confidential trading course for

1911
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,679
future millionaires or something that

1912
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,420
effect you know I've heard you heard me

1913
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,100
talk about it many times

1914
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,620
that that gave me a framework to start

1915
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,300
looking at the market differently

1916
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,699
whereas I was always jumping around

1917
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,620
and while I don't use the things that he

1918
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:23,219
teaches or taught then predominantly I

1919
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,719
still believe that that would be a

1920
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,060
wonderful starting point for someone

1921
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,600
like to uh to know

1922
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,120
how to look at price in the beginning

1923
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,520
but I there's a lot of stuff that he

1924
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,159
does that's indicator based now that

1925
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,739
you know I just I love him to death and

1926
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,440
he is my first real Mentor

1927
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,000
um if I was honest it would be Ken

1928
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,500
Roberts was there well not not

1929
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,239
technically it's really my uncle my

1930
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,219
uncle Stan was my first Mentor he's the

1931
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:51,540
one that was talking me into trading

1932
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,360
when I was 14 15 years old

1933
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,340
and I really wasn't interested showing

1934
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,840
me charts and stuff

1935
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,159
but uh

1936
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,460
the first paid Mentor I had was Ken

1937
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,640
Roberts and I bought his

1938
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,560
world's most powerful money manual

1939
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,940
course and it was about trading

1940
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,600
Commodities and uh very very

1941
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,080
poor presentation of the marketplace but

1942
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,719
it made me think I could quit my job in

1943
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,520
Uber it's a span of 20 years I could you

1944
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,040
know retire I started fleshing out this

1945
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,460
whole idea of getting rich long term

1946
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,260
and uh if I could make a thousand

1947
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,880
dollars a month that would get me there

1948
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,100
that's how I first started now contrast

1949
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,659
that with what you see on Instagram and

1950
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:36,480
YouTube and Twitter and discords and

1951
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,460
everything else that's out there it's

1952
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,620
real fast Lamborghini lifestyle you know

1953
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,480
get rich real quick

1954
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,640
and at this you know it's unfortunate

1955
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,620
because you shouldn't be thinking like

1956
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,460
that

1957
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,260
but it's going to take you a lot longer

1958
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,780
than you want them believe it will just

1959
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,900
know that and I was in for the long term

1960
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,699
I knew it was going to be hard

1961
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:58,199
but I didn't realize how hard I was

1962
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:00,120
going to make it for myself I knew how

1963
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,760
to do most of what I'm doing here

1964
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,480
um

1965
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,400
the first three and a half years but

1966
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,199
then I started to Tinker with improving

1967
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,260
it and made more mistakes and just went

1968
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,199
back to what I had arrived at

1969
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,280
so

1970
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,140
with that information

1971
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,120
coupled with

1972
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,739
chance meetings with people you're not

1973
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:22,140
ever going to meet that combination of

1974
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,100
insight you know makes me who I am in a

1975
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:30,120
circle Trader ICT now the guy but uh

1976
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,000
I want you to think about

1977
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,540
what level of contentment do you require

1978
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,920
are you trading to be

1979
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,739
the best social media Trader

1980
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:45,360
are you training to be the guy that

1981
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,760
makes the biggest pit haul or Point Hall

1982
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,739
the guy that tries to get the highest

1983
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,540
high and the lowest level what is it

1984
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,400
that you're trying to do because I went

1985
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,320
through all those stages

1986
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,300
as a Trader I went through all of that

1987
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,840
the market

1988
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,060
and the one you got to settle in on is

1989
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,880
the the person that makes the money that

1990
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,620
you're comfortable with making

1991
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,179
some of you think that you want to make

1992
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,620
millions of dollars and I'm gonna be

1993
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,320
honest with you it's scary sometimes

1994
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,300
when you're making big money

1995
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,679
and you're probably not prepared for

1996
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:17,880
that I'm going to be honest you're not

1997
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,440
prepared for that nobody is when you

1998
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,540
start making big money it's a weird

1999
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,360
feeling you think it's going to be like

2000
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,340
easy it's not

2001
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,219
because it's intoxicating

2002
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:31,620
you think that every Big Win is going to

2003
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,300
be available every single time you get

2004
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,400
into a new trade and you gotta control

2005
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,380
you have to control that impulse

2006
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,480
smart money distributed

2007
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,699
real time I was explaining it to you and

2008
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:50,040
look where we're drawing downtown to

2009
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,540
the high end of that but I saw the

2010
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,020
quarterly pool

2011
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,719
that's this over here

2012
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,900
and the lows are over here

2013
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,100
okay

2014
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,739
so when I show examples I'm doing you

2015
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:09,239
know entries and stuff

2016
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,560
and the guys out there that are trying

2017
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,900
to sell their black box they

2018
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,880
hate the fact that I'm able to do it

2019
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,620
and they want to say it's cherry-picked

2020
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,199
and I can't trade and my students don't

2021
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,880
make money and do what they do

2022
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:25,020
um I I understand marketing I understand

2023
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,640
doing all that stuff but it really looks

2024
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,360
bad

2025
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,179
when you're constantly out there saying

2026
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:31,860
that my students or I can't do this

2027
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,840
stuff and I'm constantly

2028
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,540
doing it real time I'm not afraid to be

2029
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,400
out here and doing this and calling it

2030
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,679
the logic is real

2031
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:44,159
the authorship is genuine

2032
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,540
and it repeats it's something that's

2033
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,920
transferable

2034
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,260
and when I'm outlining what it should do

2035
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,880
and how it should behave

2036
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,960
I'm leaning on elements that

2037
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,900
you aren't able to know

2038
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,659
and I'm trying to teach by example with

2039
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:02,760
experience and repetition for the folks

2040
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,020
that really want to learn how to do it

2041
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,239
you can get it from what I'm teaching

2042
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,940
you can get the very thing that you're

2043
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,980
looking for but the problem is if you're

2044
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,040
constantly moving and evolving into what

2045
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,440
your your definition of success is

2046
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,199
watch this little area in here

2047
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:25,260
if you're constantly changing that how

2048
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,540
do you rate or measure

2049
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,760
success like what is it that you're

2050
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,800
looking for that meets

2051
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,920
the goal like are you trying to trade

2052
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,140
to be better than me or better than

2053
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,239
somebody else that doesn't like me so

2054
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:40,739
you can Flex on social media because if

2055
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:43,020
you're doing it that's stupid

2056
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,760
if you're trying to be

2057
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,300
the thought the most followed Trader

2058
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,820
I should run into that right there

2059
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,560
you're trying to do all those things

2060
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,020
they're they're

2061
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,199
superficial they don't mean anything

2062
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,820
doesn't mean

2063
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,860
making money being able to take care of

2064
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,900
yourself and your family and build

2065
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,400
generational wealth that way you can

2066
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,780
transfer this information once you learn

2067
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,900
it it's yours it's your skill set

2068
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,340
you'll probably be met with the same

2069
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,080
thing that my own kids have and because

2070
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,239
all of you think out there man ict's

2071
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,400
kids they should be so good at trading

2072
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,960
and this and that other thing they're

2073
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,340
kids

2074
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,140
just like I was I wasn't interested when

2075
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,940
I was 14 and 15 years old my uncle was

2076
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,560
trying to tell me he had made money I

2077
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,540
didn't give a I didn't care it

2078
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,920
didn't mean anything to me I wanted to

2079
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,140
be a kid and that's where my kids are

2080
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,719
and I'm trying not to rush them because

2081
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,400
believe me I want them to know how to do

2082
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,120
this

2083
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,360
and they just are kids they're this

2084
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,420
their children at heart still and even

2085
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,980
my 20 year olds you know they're still

2086
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,540
trying to find themselves and my

2087
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,820
daughter's completely lost she's

2088
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,920
Perpetual student

2089
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,140
college kid

2090
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,699
because she doesn't want to embrace

2091
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:57,060
adulthood and go out there and fail

2092
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,400
and I'm her golden parachute that keeps

2093
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,179
protecting her

2094
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,080
let's see here

2095
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,640
don't close candle

2096
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,719
yeah

2097
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,840
so far respecting that to see how if we

2098
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,520
get up into this area here till we get

2099
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,260
above it and treat us support

2100
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:33,440
and let's go to a daily chart

2101
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,679
maybe we have a little bit of ways to go

2102
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:42,060
to get up into that

2103
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,340
inefficiency there

2104
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,100
initially we have worked into this high

2105
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,260
so there's buy side here so that's what

2106
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,480
we're looking at

2107
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,219
also on

2108
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:55,380
how the market was reaching into those

2109
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,800
short-term highs and I'll tell you this

2110
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,719
um a smart money offset distributes

2111
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,640
their position when they're long

2112
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,620
so look at this High here okay I'm going

2113
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,840
to make this purple because I know I

2114
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,640
think we got other colors on the

2115
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:15,900
lower time frame or maybe I delete it on

2116
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,940
recall but let's go back down until one

2117
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,620
minute chart

2118
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,179
yeah deleted it

2119
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:24,960
that purple line here is that Weekly or

2120
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,179
daily chart High

2121
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:30,360
we went above it and since we went above

2122
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,460
that we're in

2123
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,020
kind of like an area of

2124
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:38,760
the word excuse me I can't think of it

2125
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,739
I'm trying to

2126
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:43,140
say but we're above that high where

2127
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,739
liquidity how far do you see it reach

2128
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,600
on the daily chart let's go back up to

2129
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,580
it real quick

2130
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,520
or weekly router

2131
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,100
this High here the next important level

2132
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,620
above here is inside of this

2133
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,120
inefficiency

2134
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,800
right there

2135
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,239
okay so we have consequent encouragement

2136
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,040
about midpoints let's get the

2137
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,940
measurements about it might as well

2138
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:09,860
delivery you're gonna do it do it right

2139
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:13,980
so 44.28 okay so 4428 is consequent

2140
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,340
encouragement

2141
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,100
and again I'll just throw this in here

2142
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,300
because

2143
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,620
invariably I know some of you are like

2144
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,179
can you show me your FIB settings it's

2145
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,320
the first time I watched your video

2146
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,080
and that's an extension

2147
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,020
okay so there's your ICT FIB settings

2149
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,960
rewind the video if you want to see it

2150
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,300
again so consequent crunch is midpoint

2151
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,940
and that's above this High here so buy

2152
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,500
side that would rest above here so buy

2153
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,920
stops who have advice up about that

2154
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,780
long-term hedge fund Traders big large

2155
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,820
funds

2156
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,239
rated here 44.28 okay that's the

2157
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,280
midpoint of this candle's low and this

2158
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,840
candle is high and that inefficiency

2159
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,880
here is a FVG what kind of

2160
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,639
fair value you got City sell side

2161
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,000
imbalance buy side inefficiency meaning

2162
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,580
that if the market were to efficiently

2163
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,320
reprice to this

2164
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,659
it would be doing it with a run higher

2165
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,760
we've only had one pass through on the

2166
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,380
downside with this candle here between

2167
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,940
this candle is low and this candle is

2168
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,540
high we have a partial run into it here

2169
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:30,420
but we now have exposure still with

2170
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,620
inefficiency

2171
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,780
between this candle's low

2172
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,880
and this candle is high

2173
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,000
so what I'm saying is

2174
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,080
if we look at it like this

2175
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:47,219
that's the only real

2176
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:48,840
at this moment

2177
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,600
inefficiency that resides

2178
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,500
in that old

2179
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,360
gap between here and here

2180
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,040
but not

2181
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,800
a Zone I look at very specific price

2182
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,219
levels

2183
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:11,820
the 50 level of this inefficiency here

2184
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:15,239
that is consequent encroachment at 4428

2185
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:17,940
so that's a real level it's not some

2186
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:20,520
range it's a very specific level

2187
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,860
now because we have this range between

2188
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,360
this high

2189
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,920
in this candle's low that's shaded in

2190
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,760
blue

2191
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,980
I would do the same thing with that so

2192
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,639
that we would have

2193
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,699
a consequent quotient level of 4441 so I

2194
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,440
have

2195
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:40,380
44.41 is a key level to the upside

2196
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,480
and 4428

2197
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,699
they should be on your charts how you

2198
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,920
note them is your business

2199
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,440
I have it written in my notes

2200
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,600
and so piece of paper that key levels

2201
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,520
you know I have you know notations of

2202
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,600
what time frame they're anchored to

2203
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,120
that's it so me showing you that it

2204
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,639
would mean nothing to you but shown you

2205
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:01,620
in the chart like this and teaching it

2206
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,020
I'm already always teaching the levels

2207
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,520
I'm interested in anyway every time I'm

2208
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,199
doing analysis or whatever

2209
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,600
but that's how I'm referring to upside

2210
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,820
and where it might draw to

2211
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,040
but we just poked our head above this

2212
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,900
old high and then let's go back down in

2213
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,699
that one minute chart

2214
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,500
remember I was counseling you to look at

2215
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,940
how we were going higher

2216
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,520
higher and higher

2217
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,620
smart money that went long in here and

2218
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,880
down in here

2219
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,800
they would be selling their long

2220
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,420
positions

2221
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,219
above this high

2222
01:29:32,219 --> 01:29:33,900
above this high

2223
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,760
and that's how you get your three drives

2224
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,980
High formation

2225
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,980
okay which is retail pattern it's

2226
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,900
wonderful but how do you know when it

2227
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,340
forms

2228
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,600
everything I've outlined here this

2229
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,820
morning I told you and brought your

2230
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,020
attention to it right when it was

2231
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,040
forming

2232
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,620
is that cherry-picked I'll leave that up

2233
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,600
to you just uh

2234
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,860
so I would like to see how we behave

2235
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,560
at this Gap right here

2236
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,840
do we go through it like a hot knife

2237
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,920
through butter

2238
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,440
and go into this buy side or do we run

2239
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,120
above it come back down and act as

2240
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,520
support and then run which a little bit

2241
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,699
more sustained run could manifest itself

2242
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,659
if it did it that way

2243
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:25,080
so we had what was that five minute

2244
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,780
yeah so we had our five minute

2245
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,500
Gap I told you to watch that there

2246
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,080
went higher but inside this range of

2247
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,260
this Wick okay let's go through that

2248
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,860
four minute

2249
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,179
three minute

2250
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,560
two minute

2251
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,520
one minute

2252
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,620
did you notice how the bodies

2253
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,540
except for the four minute

2254
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,159
look it again here's one minute look

2255
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,440
where the bodies were

2256
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,900
they going inside the FVG no

2257
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,880
just the wickwork

2258
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,420
how about the two minute

2259
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,300
look where the bodies were

2260
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,679
the Wicks went down to offer what

2261
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,920
the inefficiency that was in here

2262
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,960
what is it inefficient

2263
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,120
South Side delivery it's a buy side

2264
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,600
imbalance cell side and efficiency busy

2265
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,060
it is a FVG by classification

2266
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,120
but specifics it's a buy side and

2267
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,500
balance outside efficiency meaning that

2268
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,320
it will likely need to drop into that

2269
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,800
again offering

2270
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,719
repricing once we leave that range

2271
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,400
becomes what it's a balanced price range

2272
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,080
let's go into three minutes

2273
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,199
look where the body stopped here

2274
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,980
in four minute

2275
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:55,980
see what's happening there the Wicks are

2276
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,620
doing damage but it's off offering the

2277
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,440
sell side but the wicks

2278
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,260
and bodies are not both inside that fair

2279
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,219
Vegas

2280
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,960
so what's it telling you

2281
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,820
it's likely to go higher which is why I

2282
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,980
told you I would like to see how it

2283
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:15,120
trades to this and if it goes above it

2284
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,800
events that the draw on here is what

2285
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,420
we're looking for but if it goes above

2286
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,980
it here but falls short of this high

2287
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:24,020
does it act as support

2288
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,880
let me see these flaring their own

2289
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,920
colors let me see

2290
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,000
I'll just do this

2291
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,620
I always tell myself that

2292
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,719
pour my water into a

2293
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:05,400
a cup that we don't hear my water bottle

2294
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:09,360
crackling but I never remember to do it

2295
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,380
such a rebel

2296
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,280
there you go

2297
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,400
buy side so we didn't get a return back

2298
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,699
into offer a support which would have

2299
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,620
been a nice little

2300
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:34,800
area to study for entry but we did get

2301
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,480
the Fairbank as I mentioned here

2302
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:43,760
let's go up into our climate chart

2303
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,900
so now how far can it go ICT

2304
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:50,580
when I have these types of runs what I

2305
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,260
like to use the FIB for I'll take the

2306
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,340
FIB

2307
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,380
anchor it to the low

2308
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,840
draw up to this high

2309
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,040
and pull up the

2310
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,880
extensions

2311
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:09,480
okay this will be first partial assuming

2312
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,159
that you would like if you're looking at

2313
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:12,420
Price action

2314
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:13,860
whether you back test it and it's

2315
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,480
already happened like when you go to

2316
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:16,620
work and come home later on you're

2317
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,120
watching this video or you're at school

2318
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,320
or if you're waking up again you're

2319
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,420
sleeping while it's being live

2320
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,980
you go back through the data like this

2321
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,239
and you look at the price swings like

2322
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,600
this you measure it one half of one

2323
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,440
standard deviation or negative 0.5

2324
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,900
that's always going to be a partial

2325
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,600
no matter how you trade whether if it's

2326
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,219
this time frame or another

2327
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,739
if you have an extension that offers you

2328
01:34:40,739 --> 01:34:42,420
profitability I don't care if it's not

2329
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,880
even five handles you have to learn to

2330
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,199
take something there when you're first

2331
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:47,760
brand new at learning how to do this

2332
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,040
because it will reward you

2333
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:54,500
and allow you to graduate into

2334
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,860
trusting

2335
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:58,560
trusting yourself trusting price action

2336
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,380
and measuring when it doesn't reach it

2337
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,360
how often does it not reach it versus

2338
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,100
how many times it does

2339
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,900
and then what you're seeing here was

2340
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,760
negative one standard deviation which is

2341
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,520
really the measured move of this low up

2342
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,040
to this High added to this High

2343
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,780
projected up so in other words if you

2344
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,699
were to take this movement from here to

2345
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:19,320
here

2346
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,260
duplicate it from this high projected up

2347
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:23,400
that's what this negative standard

2348
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,679
deviation of one is so it's a perfect

2349
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,159
measurement

2350
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,540
I like to look at

2351
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:34,139
how we have traded also so let's assume

2352
01:35:34,139 --> 01:35:36,000
for the moment and play Devil's Advocate

2353
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,280
that we were long

2354
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,080
in here

2355
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,659
and we rallied up and we took partials

2356
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:43,739
here

2357
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:46,739
and we wanted to trade the daily range

2358
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:48,900
not trade the session

2359
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,719
when I'm doing my examples I'm teaching

2360
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:53,540
you how to trade that particular session

2361
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,760
so I'm moving my stop up to protect the

2362
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,219
open profits for that particular session

2363
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:00,600
which is what you watch me do yesterday

2364
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,179
and you see me do in last Thursday's

2365
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:04,320
example

2366
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,000
so I showed you both

2367
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,920
of those positions

2368
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,500
working what the long side

2369
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,239
why because my higher time frame

2370
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,500
analysis that I've been sharing with you

2371
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,980
has been calling es higher

2372
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,900
why because it's going to trade in

2373
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:21,900
sympathy to NASDAQ even though NASDAQ I

2374
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,340
told you was to be was going to be the

2375
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,600
leader

2376
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,659
how do you manage the impulsiveness that

2377
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:28,980
comes in with

2378
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,780
not being in the strongest one because

2379
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,880
either you didn't know it or you did it

2380
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,380
by error

2381
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,900
I'm teaching you how to not even concern

2382
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,340
yourself with that

2383
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,199
so if I've already told you that NASDAQ

2384
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:42,120
was the leader on the upside but I'm

2385
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,440
going to teach you with the medium of

2386
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,540
the es and mini s p

2387
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:48,179
cynics will say oh well you you didn't

2388
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:50,460
trade in in queue so you're not even

2389
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:52,920
following your model no I'm teaching you

2390
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,860
and those individuals that will struggle

2391
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,659
with the idea that they didn't trade

2392
01:36:57,659 --> 01:36:59,040
NASDAQ when it was the strongest one

2393
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,719
because they didn't know or was told by

2394
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,880
me after November of this year

2395
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,980
I won't be telling you these things

2396
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:06,239
so you have to lean on your own

2397
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,040
experience and what you know

2398
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,719
so

2399
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:12,000
while it can be frustrating

2400
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,560
that you're not in the faster running

2401
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,880
Market

2402
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,320
it doesn't matter because you can still

2403
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,840
find you can still find setups

2404
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,659
so by having this

2405
01:37:21,659 --> 01:37:25,320
outlined ex you know experience where we

2406
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,460
know that the Market's likely to draw on

2407
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,380
these higher time frame premium arrays

2408
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,000
that means it's going to go up

2409
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,540
how do I engage with it well how do I

2410
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,820
teach you first start looking for one

2411
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,560
good setup per week

2412
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,420
just find one good setup not an everyday

2413
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,739
setup

2414
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:42,540
because if you can find a setup that you

2415
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,940
can find once a week that same model

2416
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,040
that same approach that you use for that

2417
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,420
one setup that you've been waiting for

2418
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,719
for one period of trading inside of an

2419
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:52,800
entire week

2420
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,900
you're going to forge discipline

2421
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,699
self-control

2422
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:59,400
you will get your ends met by that

2423
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,800
and because you're getting experience

2424
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,600
with it you can take that and reduce it

2425
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,460
to a smaller time frame and you can find

2426
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:07,940
more of that same model in formation

2427
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:11,280
across the entire spectrum of the week

2428
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,300
silver bullets exist in many runs but I

2429
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,340
just gave you a very specific

2430
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,179
time when they form every day

2431
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:22,620
but unless you know where the Market's

2432
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:23,580
going to go

2433
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,620
it's highly unlikely that you're going

2434
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:29,400
to be consistent with it because

2435
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,440
you're just going to be guessing

2436
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,580
and you're gonna look at every little

2437
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,340
separation between three candles and

2438
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:36,780
think it's a fair value got that it's an

2439
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,340
entry on and it's not

2440
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,780
you still have to know where the

2441
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,000
Market's likely to go to

2442
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,760
now Devil's Advocates say we were long

2443
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,219
and it wasn't a CPI day it was just a

2444
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:49,500
normal every run-of-the-mill day and we

2445
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,600
went long and everything behaved as we

2446
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,920
see here

2447
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,960
we were taking partials here we were

2448
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,500
taking majority of our trade off

2449
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,780
in here the stop would have remained

2450
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,460
below

2451
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,920
the opening price

2452
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,080
at 8 30 when the market started making

2453
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,360
its run let's go back into

2454
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,139
a limited chart

2455
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,239
here's your E30 opening price

2456
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,699
you would still have your stop or it

2457
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:19,320
would be below this opening price

2458
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,080
initially

2459
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,520
let's get this scrubbed up here a little

2460
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,699
bit

2461
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:30,719
this Wick consequences would be in here

2462
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,420
your stop would have to be below that

2463
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,940
but ICT earlier you said it doesn't need

2464
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,139
to go down it doesn't need to go down

2465
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:38,580
there but it can revisit the consequent

2466
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:41,340
encouragement it can

2467
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,199
8 30 is when the news embargo lifts that

2468
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,100
means there's going to be volatility

2469
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,500
it's going to get up and down not to

2470
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,360
this magnitude because CPI is a little

2471
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,400
bit more aggressive

2472
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,620
think of it like non-farm payroll it can

2473
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,780
be a little bit more wild or more

2474
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,880
animated

2475
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,739
so or if you want to be very

2476
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,600
conservative

2477
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,420
your stop loss again you're trading for

2478
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,920
the daily range so that means you're not

2479
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,719
trying to do your 30 contracts your 40

2480
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,900
contracts Max position okay you're

2481
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,000
trying to trade the daily range or

2482
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,260
you're trying to maximize the

2483
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:16,920
availability of the full Daily range

2484
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,480
your stock could be placed below here

2485
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,940
minimum constant encroachment so let's

2486
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,199
give you

2487
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:23,610
the specifics on that

2489
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,199
so stop loss would have to be below 43

2490
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:30,780
88 and a quarter which is so close in

2491
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,480
proximity to 43.87 and a quarter which

2492
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,820
is the low end where I told you the sell

2493
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,800
side look what being resided which is

2494
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,080
relative equal lows here

2495
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,300
and no no not that I'm sorry

2496
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,139
here

2497
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:47,880
and again I mentioned the buy side here

2498
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,380
so

2499
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,600
we've already worked that sell side

2500
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,280
so how do you place your stop loss and

2501
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,900
feel confident that it's not going to

2502
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,820
hit it and knock you out if you're

2503
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,620
trying to day trade

2504
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:02,100
day trading is position trading for the

2505
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,320
daily range

2506
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,300
intraday scalping

2507
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,340
is session trading that means you're

2508
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,020
trading the morning session before lunch

2509
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:13,860
in New York and in the PM session

2510
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,900
there's a distinction there

2511
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,120
when I say day trading what I'm saying

2512
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,159
is you're trying to capitalize on the

2513
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:23,280
majority of the daily full run from open

2514
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,780
to close you're trying to get the

2515
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,880
alliance portion of that move that's not

2516
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,520
scalping that's day trading

2517
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,159
scalping or intraday scalping or session

2518
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,560
trading is where you're getting in and

2519
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,260
out typically many times within the same

2520
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:41,239
hour or so or two hours

2521
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:44,940
how do you trade that ICT versus when

2522
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,040
you're teaching us recently in the last

2523
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,320
year or so when I'm doing my examples

2524
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,480
I'm teaching you how to operate inside

2525
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,280
of the session whether it be the morning

2526
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,480
session or an afternoon session whatever

2527
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,360
one I'm trading in at the time

2528
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm capitalizing the move that I foresee

2529
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,159
that would be just the lines portion of

2530
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:05,280
that specific session of the day whether

2531
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,619
it be London session New York session or

2532
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:09,600
New York PM session whatever it is I'm

2533
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,119
trading it's relative to that specific

2534
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:13,260
session

2535
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,080
if you want to capture larger runs on

2536
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,400
price

2537
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,619
then you're going to leave

2538
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:22,080
your stop loss which

2539
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,179
I know some of you don't like that it

2540
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,800
makes it

2541
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:29,580
terribly fearful that leaving a stop

2542
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,100
loss while the Market's running all up

2543
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,000
here

2544
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,040
and up here your stop loss would still

2545
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:38,520
be below the opening because

2546
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,179
you won't learn how to play stops and

2547
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:44,760
move stops effectively in the beginning

2548
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,340
by trying to move them tight or try to

2549
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,500
see what I do like when you see me do

2550
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
that it always comes with a price

2551
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,960
invariably if you Trail your stop loss

2552
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,119
it will be hit eventually it will

2553
01:42:57,119 --> 01:43:00,300
absolutely be hit my stops get hit when

2554
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,280
they're trailed up eventually boom it

2555
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,619
gets out but I have taken the majority

2556
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:06,420
of my trade-off in profit before that

2557
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,920
even happens

2558
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,260
so when I do those examples I'm teaching

2559
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:10,980
you

2560
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:14,280
how to graduate into that now I know if

2561
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,739
I want to be in a day trade if I think

2562
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:18,119
the daily range is going to expand and

2563
01:43:18,119 --> 01:43:19,560
close near the high of the day and I'm

2564
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,520
bullish

2565
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,020
then I'm not going to need a rush to

2566
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,280
move my

2567
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,560
stop loss it's going to stay where I

2568
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,900
initially place it and I'm not worried

2569
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,820
about reducing its exposure because

2570
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,980
throughout the day what am I doing I'm

2571
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,260
taking partials to pay me which is in by

2572
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,659
default it reduces the exposure that you

2573
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:38,639
would have with a stop loss at or below

2574
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,380
the low end of that range which would be

2575
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,820
known here there's no need for it to

2576
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,840
come back down here it's already done

2577
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,639
the damage

2578
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,739
and Traders are not going to be wanting

2579
01:43:46,739 --> 01:43:49,260
to go in here go long because they've

2580
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,880
seen this big wick down here and it

2581
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,199
whipped here now they're scared

2582
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,280
and they don't understand what you're

2583
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,679
being taught that the first run on

2584
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:01,440
liquidity is the tip that's the that's

2585
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,239
the signature that you're looking for if

2586
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:05,100
you want to be long

2587
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,560
the best time to go along is after sell

2588
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,540
stops have been taken

2589
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:12,600
I've said this in old videos on YouTube

2590
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,040
some of the videos aren't even on my

2591
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,080
YouTube channel anymore where are those

2592
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,760
videos you're hiding stuff that's it's

2593
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,739
just their old the production quality

2594
01:44:19,739 --> 01:44:22,440
sucked but the things I talked about

2595
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,560
even when I was on baby Pips many of you

2596
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,320
let it go in one ear out the other

2597
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,860
but it's still it's still true

2598
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:34,020
so if you're looking for

2599
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:36,480
uh bias you want to learn how to do

2600
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,820
daily bias it starts with understanding

2601
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:41,159
where that Weekly chart is likely to go

2602
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:42,000
to

2603
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,040
that's that's the first

2604
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,199
thing you have to decide is it going to

2605
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:48,600
more likely go up on the weekly candle

2606
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,760
or down why would it be wanting to go

2607
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,500
higher or lower that's what I've been

2608
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,860
showing you

2609
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,280
that's what I've been putting your

2610
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,500
attention to on that Weekly chart

2611
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,500
and every time it starts to go low

2612
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,580
intraday charts on one minute three

2613
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,260
minute and five minute candles you see

2614
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:05,520
people out there trying to chase it like

2615
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,560
it's going to go lower

2616
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,420
and it's only going down to present new

2617
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:10,739
buying opportunities that's all it's

2618
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:13,920
doing it's going into discounts

2619
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,980
so as a day trader you know you could be

2620
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,020
still long your stop loss will be below

2621
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,600
the the low end of that dealing range

2622
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,000
where sell side was already tagged

2623
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:29,100
lines portion of the move will be off

2624
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,719
here and you would have taken partials

2625
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,540
Above This High here as well

2626
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:36,179
you would not as a day trader put your

2627
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:38,100
stop loss below that low

2628
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,260
why

2629
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,659
what do I teach you about the lunch hour

2630
01:45:42,659 --> 01:45:46,739
lunch hour macro runs on liquidity what

2631
01:45:46,739 --> 01:45:50,219
liquidity the stops that would favor the

2632
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,020
folks that have been profitable all

2633
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,280
morning long going into the New York

2634
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,460
lunch they have trailed their stop loss

2635
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,080
because they don't want to lose open

2636
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,719
profit when really they're guaranteeing

2637
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,840
no potential further open profit because

2638
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,119
the market will in fact many times go

2639
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:07,560
down and take out the low of the day

2640
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,860
that was formed prior to 11 or noon near

2641
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,300
political time

2642
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,340
they'll take those stops when does it

2643
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,380
occur between 12 o'clock

2644
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,900
New York local time and 1 30 New York

2645
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,880
local time

2646
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,679
don't believe me go into your charts and

2647
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:24,300
see if it's what's going on I don't want

2648
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,440
you to believe anything I'm saying I

2649
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,179
want you to go into the charts and back

2650
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,699
test and look at that stuff because you

2651
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:31,560
will see it you won't need to hear me

2652
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,940
say it all the time

2653
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,440
it will be in your notes and you'll

2654
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:38,480
it'll be part of your repertoire

2655
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:42,900
so I taught a lot of stuff today and for

2656
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,639
someone brand new or this is the first

2657
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,860
live stream you want us to buy me it

2658
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,440
probably feels disjointed it feels like

2659
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,940
it's

2660
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:54,480
not really you know organized well it

2661
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,980
didn't really teach you anything that

2662
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,659
you can go out and do tomorrow

2663
01:46:57,659 --> 01:46:58,920
um actually I taught you a lot that you

2664
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,300
can go into your charts right now when

2665
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,040
I'm closing this live stream you can go

2666
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,780
into your old price moves and start

2667
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:04,800
studying it with these things and

2668
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,600
reference points that I gave you

2669
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,699
um I outlined it live for you I told you

2670
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:10,080
where the Lakota on both sides would be

2671
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,119
I told you the framework with the fair

2672
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,219
value got I mentioned that we would

2673
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:17,040
watch this one here we're bullish okay I

2674
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,920
didn't say we're topping just means that

2675
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,679
we're looking for the 9 30 opening

2676
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:25,139
okay what is it going to run for and I

2677
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:26,820
told you I want to see how it behaves at

2678
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:30,360
this very value Gap and we're down here

2679
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,219
and we would want to see it run for the

2680
01:47:32,219 --> 01:47:34,320
buy side which it did the longer term

2681
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,679
draw

2682
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:41,420
the 4428 I think the first one was

2683
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,580
okay so that's Costco encroachment of

2684
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,739
the old weekly

2685
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:03,239
City

2686
01:48:03,239 --> 01:48:06,719
okay so have that on your chart so 4428

2687
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,760
and uh

2688
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,920
treat that going forward into the rest

2689
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,300
of the week

2690
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,219
and study how we deliver if at all it

2691
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:15,900
may not get to get up there this week it

2692
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,699
doesn't have to do it this week

2693
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,739
but I'm looking for it to graduate

2694
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:21,420
towards

2695
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,580
those levels have outlined on the weekly

2696
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,100
chart nothing says that we are making a

2697
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,060
high

2698
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,400
score that we've topped okay

2699
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,199
I think that's going to be sufficient

2700
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,560
for today

2701
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:34,860
hopefully you learned something

2702
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,659
hopefully I'll give you some homework to

2703
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:38,940
go into your charts and start analyzing

2704
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:41,820
and see where things are manifesting

2705
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,920
and build up that experience with your

2706
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,840
journal the more experience that you

2707
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,360
gain in studying old moves the better

2708
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,219
you're going to be because your brain is

2709
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:53,040
going to retain that as framework and

2710
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,540
when you start watching price real time

2711
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,520
tape reading where you're not pressing a

2712
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,560
demo entry you're not trading with a

2713
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,460
live account

2714
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:02,340
you're just watching price and observing

2715
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,920
what it's doing that is a critical part

2716
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,540
of learning how to do this whether you

2717
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,639
learn how to trade through me or anyone

2718
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,699
else I promise you if you put more time

2719
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:13,380
into that

2720
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,860
you will be more equipped better

2721
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:18,239
equipped

2722
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,280
to trade and try to get these funded

2723
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,360
account challenges if you want to do

2724
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,100
funded accounts or trade with your live

2725
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,600
funds

2726
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,400
and you'll know you won't need me I

2727
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,020
never tell anybody it's time for you to

2728
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,639
start trading with real money

2729
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:32,460
you'll know because you'll be bored by

2730
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,139
the results you'll see yourself doing

2731
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:36,239
all the time you won't be emotional

2732
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,520
about it and when you get to that point

2733
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,020
and you're learning

2734
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:43,260
that is my opinion for you to decide

2735
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,940
whether or not you want to get in and

2736
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,560
start risking real money

2737
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,119
because you're not influenced by the

2738
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:51,960
money or swayed by the periodic times

2739
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,000
where you do it wrong you're doing it

2740
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,139
right more times than you're doing it

2741
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,360
wrong so therefore the results show that

2742
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,000
there is a probability of sustained

2743
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,080
profitability

2744
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,940
if you stick to that same approach going

2745
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:03,780
forward

2746
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:05,400
