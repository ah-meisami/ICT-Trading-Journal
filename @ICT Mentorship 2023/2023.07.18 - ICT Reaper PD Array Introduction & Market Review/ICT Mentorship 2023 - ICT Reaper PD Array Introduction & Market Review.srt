1
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,340
welcome back folks

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,699
all right just a quick little review and

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,039
an introduction to a new PD array I'll

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,539
make public

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,460
so we're looking at the dollar indexes

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,720
our daily chart

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,180
and we have basically just been

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,220
Meandering around

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,159
the Gap I told you about between these

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,620
two weekly reference points so without

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,180
going into the weekly chart save some

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,059
time that's what we're watching I would

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,980
prefer to see it trade down into a

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,879
little bit but uh it didn't do so

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,860
all right here we are folks

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,899
I'll take your attention back to the

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,579
video I did on my YouTube channel

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,719
July 9th 2023 it's a market review

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
and prior to

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
this day running

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
off the weekly version fair value Gap I

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,159
mentioned that we would open on a new

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,720
week trade down use this

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
inversion fair value Gap from the weekly

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,840
chart and I'll count you to go back and

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,159
look at the old videos

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
now all this is not added to the Chart

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,420
after the fact

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,840
that we opened traded down rallied up

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
and then we had finally today Mark trade

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
up complete the weekly volume and

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,580
balance when you're a dollar

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,520
so that is an absolute

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,020
slam dunk

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,780
all net

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
swish

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,900
my side

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
that was the initial draw then we would

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,560
get into the weekly volume and bounce

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,079
just a beautiful delivery these are the

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,420
types of moves that you want to capture

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,460
and really sitting your hands and wait

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,820
for it makes trading very fun

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
but unfortunately you know

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,460
when these big powerful moves take place

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,780
they don't give you a whole lot of

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,060
opportunities you have to know what

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,460
you're looking for and then get in and

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
try to avoid

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,780
um thinking that it has to retrace

51
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,980
because it'll just keep running higher

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,560
and higher the reason why it's done this

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,420
is because the dollar was exceedingly

54
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,340
bearish like we were expecting

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,900
on July 9th

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,140
so even the s p here is our weekly chart

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,060
so I'm taking your attention into and

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
Beyond this was the original weekly

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
volume advance that we were talking

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,060
about back down here we finally got into

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,280
that closure

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,860
today uh well this week rather

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,860
um we traded to it and through it now

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,800
we're looking at this

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
volume and balance so there was two

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,519
volume imbalances on the weekly chart

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,800
for Nasdaq and it had already completed

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
both of them

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,879
es has been lagging so the es has been

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,140
the sixth sister between the two

71
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,780
averages and I mentioned that NASDAQ is

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,879
the leadership issue so you're all

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,400
asking me why am I trading NASDAQ I'm

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,160
actually in the NASDAQ as the leadership

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,780
issue so it's going to be an

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060
outperformance at the upside

77
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,519
but here we have a fair value Gap in

78
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,860
here with a breaker

79
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,900
and then we have Bubble shoulder block

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
and a propulsion block and the market

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,319
sends price higher

82
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,480
completing this weekly volume amounts

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
and the pink and then we have this one

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,140
here so you want to have these two

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,120
levels here the

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,860
the high and the low the weekly volume

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,379
balance

88
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,080
have that in your chart and

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,159
use them as potential support resistance

90
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,120
I

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,700
see a lot of questions about this

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,060
button down here for settlement I like

93
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
to use the settlement price

94
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,500
toggled on when I'm looking for things

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,239
like

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,379
where we closed in reference to like the

97
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,159
uh

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,840
TGIF trade okay I I toggle back and

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,480
forth between both of them so I'm

100
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,980
looking for volume and balances I'm

101
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,680
looking for

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,079
inefficiencies that may materialize so

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,540
things that might go on the radar of

104
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,459
other Traders I'm looking at both

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,139
perspectives so it's not a matter of it

106
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,520
only works for this it only works for

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,280
that I'm flexible in terms of what I'm

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,820
looking for in terms of imbalances and

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,040
or where we actually close at silent

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,060
because of

111
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,259
the TGIF ideas

112
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,500
all right so we are looking at a daily

113
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,900
chart here e-mini s p

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,780
um You probably hear my puppy Bailey I

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,300
apologize if you do here but uh she's

116
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,940
morning like I am we lost our

117
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,560
other boxer Bella but uh she wants to be

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,300
close to me and I can't send her away

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,979
while I'm doing this because you know

120
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,120
they still have the heart to do it so

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,940
anyway that's her whimpering

122
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,040
she's fine she's just sad

123
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,300
so

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,000
we have today's trading here

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
Monday's Trading

126
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,020
and then here's where we were working

127
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
off of this fair value Gap right there I

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,120
mentioned and I'll show you the Tweet

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,020
um

130
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,820
as it was today but I've mentioned it

131
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,960
many times

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,300
over the years that we do not try to

133
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,620
pick tops

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,479
in buy programs

135
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,340
okay and we don't try to pick bottoms

136
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,100
and sell programs that means we are

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,479
always

138
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,820
giving the market the opportunity to

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,039
color outside the lines that most other

140
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,419
Traders would think that okay we're

141
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,580
we're so overbought now it has to come

142
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,620
back now it has to retrace it has to

143
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,139
have a retracement no it's awesome it

144
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,080
doesn't have to do that and when the

145
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,320
market is wanting to go higher you have

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,840
to submit to that or

147
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,539
don't trade because if you arm wrestling

148
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,919
you'll hurt yourself

149
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,539
so these are the levels we have on our

150
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,039
chart now so let me drop in a lower time

151
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,199
frame so it'd be much more meaningful to

152
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,160
you

153
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,479
so here we are on the 18th of July 2023

154
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,160
and

155
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
we had a small consolidation and then we

156
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,660
dropped down took out sell side and then

157
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,600
a rapid acceleration into and above

158
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
Monday's high trading up into that

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
higher

160
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,600
weekly volume of valence

161
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,300
all right let's take a look at the

162
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,520
five minute chart now I'm skipping over

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,020
the 15-minute charts just for the sake

164
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,100
of

165
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,600
gravity but these are 15 minute fair

166
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,340
value gaps

167
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,620
so that way you can take a look at on

168
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,720
your content time frame

169
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,940
and Order block as well we trade down

170
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,500
and hit that this is all 15 minute chart

171
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,319
basis I'm heading here so that way for

172
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,419
your homework you can go into a 50

173
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,759
minute time frame and find out what

174
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,080
these are

175
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
on the Bellwether chart which is in a

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,000
time frame but the five minute lots of

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,860
opportunities lots of entries today

178
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,600
quarter block on a 15 minute time frame

179
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,340
order block on 15 minute Tony frame you

180
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,319
can see the reactions off of it here and

181
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,699
then trading up into that Weekly volume

182
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,520
and balance

183
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,340
[Music]

184
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,280
okay moving on into NASDAQ this is where

185
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,180
the

186
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,180
the brass tags are for this presentation

187
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,180
so I mentioned how we had

188
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,060
these relative equal highs

189
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,560
and we were likely to go through that

190
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,300
last week we did that and now we are

191
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,740
continuing through

192
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,259
last week's High

193
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,960
and again that's you're only going to

194
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,539
catch this type of continuation if you

195
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,940
avoid make it part of your repertoire

196
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,560
and routine as a mindset as a Trader you

197
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,139
do not try to pick tops while the

198
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,720
Market's going up you don't do it you

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
simply do not do it it's far easier for

200
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,400
you just to Simply submit to the idea

201
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,120
that it wants to go higher so trade in

202
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,919
that order flow

203
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,900
don't look at patterns trying to capture

204
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,120
Market reversals because they're going

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,139
to run right over top of you

206
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,280
all right here's the daily chart here

207
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,300
and

208
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,699
you have an order block there we talked

209
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,800
about that repulsion block we don't want

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,139
to see a closing price below the middle

211
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,479
or mean threshold of a compulsion block

212
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
we never saw that the market rallied

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,340
last week and then now we had here

214
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,800
Tuesdays Trading

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,440
Tuesdays though for me and Monday's

216
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,479
trading here so we had a really nice

217
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,419
little drop down in small little

218
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,640
institutional Oracle entry job not by

219
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,700
much but you don't need much right so

220
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,200
we'll take a look at that when we get

221
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,640
lower time frames but continuation on

222
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,860
the upside just a wonderful amount of

223
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,080
opportunity to see that trade notice

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,459
that we opened

225
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,279
traded down today and cut through the

226
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,500
candles because we're not supplying to

227
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,060
me

228
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,040
they're high down Revisited that is a

229
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,420
discount array

230
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,880
so if you look at my month four content

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,959
uh

232
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,660
St mentorship it's my premium mentorship

233
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,339
there's core content lessons are on my

234
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,680
YouTube channel go to playlist for month

235
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
four

236
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,300
and you'll see the pdra Matrix lectures

237
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,180
in that

238
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,519
segment of videos

239
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,839
and in the discount we have

240
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,360
old highs and old looks so let me trade

241
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,600
back down in to it like that

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,580
one more bullish we would expect to see

243
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,779
prices trade higher

244
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
all right on an hourly chart

245
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,860
we can see that we have

246
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,540
the market dropped down

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,279
small consolidation this is where retail

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,560
is going to see a bull flag

249
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,860
okay rallying consolidation and they

250
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,480
want to see it go higher

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
I was asked today on my Twitter account

252
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,420
you know what my bias was so I went over

253
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,740
that and actually show you the Tweet so

254
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,540
that way it's not me just saying

255
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,519
something and there's no record of it

256
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,220
but it had a really nice explosive price

257
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,600
move higher

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,459
and

259
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,260
cleared the 16 000 level

260
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,820
five minute chart here you can see the

261
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,220
low forming here just shortly after the

262
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,200
9 30 opening

263
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,940
creates a fair value Gap here trades

264
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,640
down into that beautiful run

265
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,980
right from there takes off

266
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,140
a small little fair value Gap here hits

267
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,300
it with an overblock very very high

268
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,620
probability

269
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,600
rallies

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,940
order block

271
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,399
rallies and then Finds Its High the day

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,260
in the last hour trading

273
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,899
and then trading off the highs

274
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,640
back into

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,250
an order block

276
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,519
[Music]

277
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,440
at 7 43

278
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,140
New York local time

279
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,120
I tweeted today

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,740
and I said that

281
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,140
we're not trying to pick tops and buy

282
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,440
programs okay basically a buy program is

283
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,060
when the market is under an algorithmic

284
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,480
price delivery or Price run that's

285
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
repricing higher

286
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,620
it's not a classic bull market it's not

287
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,779
a

288
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,180
Trend because I don't like talking about

289
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,500
things in those

290
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,420
terms because

291
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,579
I don't have any affinity for those

292
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,959
types of things I did when I first

293
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,560
started but once my eyes were open to

294
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,560
how markets are highly manipulated and

295
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,360
then I codified a lot of things you now

296
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,260
are learning from me I've completely

297
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,660
dismissed everything else

298
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,540
so when I'm looking for higher prices

299
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,760
when my algorithm is looking for higher

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,560
prices and it's spooling and running

301
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,140
higher I'm going to refrain from and I

302
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,700
teach my students to refrain from trying

303
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,160
to pick tops no matter what pattern you

304
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,320
think exists in price action no matter

305
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,940
who you love

306
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,860
in worship online

307
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,500
whatever they say avoid it I promise you

308
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,120
if you do that you'll you'll spare

309
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,399
yourself a lot of losses

310
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,279
but yesterday was evidence that it's

311
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,160
never a good idea or strategy

312
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,700
and I mentioned this morning I mean

313
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,420
July 18 2023 this morning I am waiting

314
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,820
to see if they use the retail sales data

315
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,620
which was released at 8 30 in New York

316
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,240
local time

317
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,019
to drop in then rally higher if it drops

318
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,480
and doesn't rally it matters not to me

319
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
movement is desired so what do I mean by

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,800
that

321
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,899
well

322
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,300
here is the 9 30 delivery

323
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,260
okay and this is the time of the Tweet

324
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,459
right there

325
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,220
so I was not counseling you as my

326
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,440
students to look at that consolidation

327
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,959
as a bullfight and go higher

328
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,180
I didn't want to see that I wanted to

329
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,360
see it go against retail mindset which

330
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
would be continuation or classic retail

331
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,279
continuation patterns and they would see

332
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,040
and would have saw a bull flag

333
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,620
I'm not a fan of that so the market

334
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,620
drops down at 9 30 which creates a Judah

335
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,079
swing this market for Traction in the

336
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,820
opposite direction to what retail would

337
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,279
expect it goes down creates a short term

338
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,740
little low rallies up and then Dives one

339
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,680
more time that is absolutely

340
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,800
beautiful because that sets the trap for

341
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,560
every Trader out there that thinks that

342
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,839
that bull flag was going to pan out and

343
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,579
then now they want to catch this low

344
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,100
down here then they get stopped out that

345
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,980
immediately scares ninety percent of any

346
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,139
retail Traders won't get along

347
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,519
they don't want to go along now they're

348
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,899
scared they're going to get stopped out

349
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,060
and they don't know what to expect what

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,579
I'm looking for is I want to see does

351
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,339
the market respect my PD arrays my

352
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,320
discount arrays things that I would look

353
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
to go along on in any bullish scenario

354
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,740
so now it's time for a new gift to the

355
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,000
trading community

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
okay so I want you to take a look at how

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
the market

358
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,420
created a run higher last week

359
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,820
we had a run up

360
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,519
and then a break lower

361
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,740
when we see that

362
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,380
you understand that this pattern here is

363
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,300
if we trade above it

364
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,700
come back down in that should be what

365
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,399
she does a bullish breaker right not

366
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,680
when we're in Trend continuation

367
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,959
we're in train continuation I want to

368
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,660
see the low

369
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,680
High lower low and then the next day if

370
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,139
we rally through it

371
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,360
like we do here so here's Monday's

372
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,680
Trading

373
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
now we have

374
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,019
one two three isn't that three drives

375
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,339
pattern and that's a topping pattern

376
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,660
right no

377
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,600
no no no no no no what did I say this

378
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,079
morning we're not trying to call Tops

379
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,180
so anyone that would have saw this as a

380
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,860
three drives pattern

381
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,519
here or three Indians padding if you're

382
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
a reader of Street smarts books which

383
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,860
is in my opinion one of the better books

384
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,180
out there

385
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,519
but that's not a three Jaws pattern

386
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,680
that's not a three Indians pattern okay

387
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,860
it is a setup for those individuals that

388
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,139
want to use that idea

389
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,440
so one of the things that I codified in

390
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,779
my algorithm is if there is a

391
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,579
opportunity for the market to continue

392
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,380
higher or lower everything I'm going to

393
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,060
show you here just reverse it

394
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,860
but since I'm bullish and I told

395
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,060
everybody I was bullish I was looking

396
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,639
for a drop in drop in the what

397
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,579
we'll get to it

398
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,440
that price level up there sixteen

399
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,820
thousand twenty eight point seven five

400
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,500
absolutely random

401
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,480
no

402
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,880
if you look at the price range from the

403
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,720
low

404
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,440
to the high this is a breaker

405
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,480
but there's something specific about

406
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,240
this breaker that we have to know and

407
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,300
then use it slightly different

408
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,820
low high lower low

409
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,360
this stops out longs

410
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,699
so lungs are now no longer allowed to be

411
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,220
participants of the next energetic price

412
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,740
leg higher

413
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm not requiring price

414
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,779
to trade in a normal sense with the

415
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,339
breaker I want to look for something

416
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,060
different

417
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,680
this low up to this high that is the

418
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,060
standard

419
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,600
measurement for projection on targets so

420
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,180
if this was a classic breaker you would

421
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,759
use the low to the high

422
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,680
and the lower low

423
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,660
that goes below this low here that sets

424
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,000
the tone for the pattern as a breaker

425
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,380
but for

426
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,660
swing projections for targeting purposes

427
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,759
all we're doing is taking the low to the

428
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,939
high one standard deviation

429
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,579
that's what we're looking for sixteen

430
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,919
thousand zero two eight

431
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,819
point seven five

432
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,599
I think it went one handle above it is

433
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,260
that is that precise enough for you

434
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,299
we're going to go a little bit beyond

435
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:24,848
that now

436
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,480
[Music]

437
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,980
this is

438
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,200
my ICT Reaper inversion for your value

439
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,220
go

440
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,460
yes I know it's a badass name I know

441
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,960
a Reaper

442
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,900
in version bear I got is when you're

443
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,400
inside of a breaker

444
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,780
you're going to cut through candles

445
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,280
because we are not supplying demand

446
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,500
folks I can't stress this enough

447
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,360
this is this is one of those lessons

448
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,700
where you can look at folks on the

449
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,559
internet they try to say I rebranded

450
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,780
stuff or I call supply and demand

451
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,419
something different or I complicate it

452
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,520
folks there is nothing like this

453
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,880
anywhere else okay I wanted to create

454
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
and codify a method to go in and

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
capitalize on number one Precision two

456
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,500
take advantage of shifted sentiment and

457
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,440
go under the radar of everybody else out

458
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,700
there

459
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,919
that's what my Reaper does

460
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,520
it's devastating it's absolutely

461
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,260
devastating because you don't see it

462
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,220
coming

463
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,240
but it's right there

464
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,700
price run

465
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,320
leaves

466
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,740
a fair value Gap in the lower portion of

467
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,660
this price run okay so it's the first

468
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,179
leg of the bullish breaker

469
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,059
the fair value Gap must be in a discount

470
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,460
relative to that low to that high you

471
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,539
see it here

472
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,220
between here and here

473
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,440
that's a discount the discount is being

474
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,380
measured on this basis the low to high

475
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,039
once we have that extend that forward if

476
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
we're bullish in this case we were

477
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,059
enough I've proven it to you I told you

478
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,880
we were looking for higher prices

479
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,740
the market

480
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,840
trades down through it doesn't respect

481
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,820
that as we would

482
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,039
expect

483
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,900
everybody that would see my stuff online

484
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,059
or think they understand it or think

485
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,120
this is a liquidity void it's not

486
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,559
it's going to trade down through it run

487
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,080
the stops why because I want to knock

488
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,059
those individuals out that have a

489
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,220
trailed stop loss there

490
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,140
in the market rallies

491
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,220
one Sunday into Monday

492
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,360
takes out the high

493
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,700
now everyone that wants to use my

494
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,760
breaker they get punished here too

495
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,020
they're not going to be able to go in

496
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,940
here and go long

497
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,280
and also the traders that are using this

498
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,780
as a bull flag they're going to get

499
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,400
punished

500
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
now I know if I was just to say all

501
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,299
these things right here this would have

502
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,760
been like oh this is Cherry Picked

503
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,200
your form fitting you're doing this

504
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,820
you're doing that

505
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,440
I said it this morning before the market

506
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
even got to 8 o'clock

507
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
it's 7 43 this morning New York local

508
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,679
time I want to see it drop down into

509
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,539
what

510
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,340
Monday's range

511
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,500
here's midnight on Monday New York local

512
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,900
time to Monday's high

513
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,440
measure that the best

514
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,940
the best fills for getting long

515
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,860
is going to be at equilibrium

516
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,860
or higher

517
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,480
except

518
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,559
when my Reaper exists in price action

519
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,380
cut through all these candles

520
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,460
and go right there

521
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,160
we see it drop down

522
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,039
and then bang that's that right there

523
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,020
that signature there that's what I was

524
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,760
looking for this morning

525
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
because it was respecting all through

526
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,520
here all through here and go right back

527
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,559
there folks this is proof that my

528
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,539
algorithm refers back to candlesticks

529
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,100
highs and lows that you would never

530
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,820
otherwise know

531
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,919
where is the support and resistance idea

532
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,140
with all this you're gonna go right here

533
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,940
right you're going to take that high and

534
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,160
draw it out in time wonderful but I've

535
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
already told you

536
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,760
classic support resistance is only

537
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,020
confirmed

538
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,720
if it has one of my fair value gaps

539
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
and look what it has right there

540
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,000
consequent encroachment of that Reaper

541
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,539
right there but if you want to know

542
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,940
and you want to have all the details

543
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,500
that I'm making available to the trading

544
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,059
community at Large

545
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,820
these are the things that I've codified

546
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,620
a Reaper is a fair value Gap

547
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,980
in a discount of the impulsive price leg

548
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,919
of a bullish breaker reverse it a

549
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,140
bearish ICT Reaper inversion fair value

550
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,020
Gap would be a bearish breaker that

551
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,179
would have a fair value Gap in the

552
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,260
premium side of the impulsive Priceline

553
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,179
so all of these things are completely

554
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,380
reversible

555
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,140
but the context is you have to have a

556
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,640
bias

557
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,220
there has to be some kind of retail idea

558
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,640
that would lure traders in well we have

559
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,480
here bullfly

560
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,940
it drops down in to what

561
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,340
the previous day's range

562
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,980
now look at the bodies respecting

563
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,280
50 of the previous day's range see that

564
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,100
remember the Wicks do the damage

565
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,080
that's the Reaper's job

566
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,480
and then that little signature right

567
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,520
there tells me it's done it's going to

568
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,600
go higher

569
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm entering on that candle

570
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,360
[Music]

571
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,120
taking all that aside

572
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,340
free pressure a little above your pay

573
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,480
grade and

574
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,039
a little confusing for you that's okay

575
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,740
I'll talk more about in my book

576
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,780
we have our standard and version fair

577
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,500
value Gap there within a breaker classic

578
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,840
bullish breaker and then here's the

579
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,200
price like

580
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,440
between the lower that handle and high

581
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
that candle those are the specific price

582
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,340
points and my fill going long six

583
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,059
contracts was 15781 even below and

584
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,159
inside the inversion Fair bag Gap there

585
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
at the candle that qualified and

586
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,679
confirmed that my Reaper was in fact

587
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,460
good to go send price higher

588
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,580
and I took a market exit it wasn't a

589
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,500
stop I just simply closed it because my

590
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,760
intentions were going to be somewhere

591
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
else and I wasn't going to be able to do

592
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,940
anything I wanted to do managing it on

593
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,580
my cell phone so there's where my

594
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,520
clothes was and a little bit higher one

595
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,380
above the 16 000 but that's still good

596
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,659
enough over 120 handles

597
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,740
on NASDAQ so about 14 Grand Plus

598
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,960
so not bad for a

599
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
couple hours of

600
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,919
leisurely fishing

601
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,299
and here is the one minute chart on

602
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,600
NASDAQ but I was entering also was we

603
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,460
had this runoff and as the candle was

604
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,900
dropping down

605
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm going to enter that right there and

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,039
then this would be your classic return

607
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,840
in for a

608
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,880
Fairway Gap

609
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,539
bullish breaker and then secondary entry

610
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,039
would have been here

611
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,360
Gifts of that one and around on up and

612
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,159
this is where I closed it manually

613
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,799
so

614
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,900
that my friends is what took place today

615
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,840
and it was a wonderful explosive price

616
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,419
move today higher after me counts on you

617
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,340
this morning we would look for a drop

618
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,980
down in previous days range

619
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,280
and just was beautifully beautifully

620
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,679
offered it was one of those days where

621
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,720
when you know what you're looking for

622
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,179
and if you're struggling with trying to

623
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,679
capture big runs

624
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,299
okay if you're on these little time

625
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,440
frames

626
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
and you're just simply just looking for

627
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,380
things like okay well here's relative

628
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,860
equal highs and and say you did buy this

629
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,380
sofa bullet okay because that's what

630
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,240
that was by the way this entry is a

631
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,500
silver bullet with all the other things

632
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,960
I gave in context so which is like a a

633
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,740
silver bullet with on steroids

634
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,980
this here is a lunchtime macro

635
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,700
it starts running higher there and you

636
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,080
might think okay well it gets about here

637
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,400
I'm done

638
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
but if you're ignoring the higher time

639
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
frame that we're going to go higher

640
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,820
anyway we're going to keep going higher

641
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,860
we're not trying to pick tops and buy

642
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,000
programs

643
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,020
and the daily range is likely to create

644
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,020
that extreme high if we're bullish in

645
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,580
the PM session

646
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,380
going into

647
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,779
that last hour

648
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,059
well look at the time of the day

649
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,279
you know

650
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,960
highly was formed

651
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
around three o'clock it didn't go beyond

652
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,900
uh 16 000 much

653
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,960
but I gave up about a hundred handles

654
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,400
but that's okay 120 is enough

655
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,100
you don't sit here and try to

656
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,080
convince yourself that five handles is

657
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,840
enough or 20 handles is enough if you

658
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
really want to capture big runs you'll

659
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,419
scare yourself entirely from holding on

660
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,520
to them and one of the best ways of

661
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,100
doing it is when you get a entry

662
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
you place your stop don't worry about

663
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,240
trailing it don't worry about trying to

664
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,020
take Parcels just let it go

665
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,480
turn off the charts go out like I did I

666
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,980
was away from the house

667
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,020
I wasn't looking at it

668
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,059
because I'm not worrying about all the

669
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,279
things I'm trusting my algorithm I'm

670
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,860
trusting what's codified I'm trusting

671
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,720
that the delivery of price is going to

672
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,679
be exactly what it has been coded to do

673
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,740
price the high in the afternoon session

674
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,480
the last hour then you'll get your

675
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,799
retracement

676
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,720
that's power three

677
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
this is not the entire daily range here

678
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,720
I'm just showing you where my trade

679
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,179
entry was in my exit remember it goes

680
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,039
higher than this it goes to sixteen

681
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,020
thousand something

682
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,179
and I didn't get all that and I don't

683
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,539
need to

684
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,220
so if you're looking for ways to hold on

685
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,779
to a trade and capture these big runs

686
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,120
not just get 10 handles or 20 handles

687
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,700
and you know yes it's great you know I'm

688
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,900
killing it

689
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,240
you may very well be killing it but

690
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,659
you're missing these monster Halls

691
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,880
by not knowing the higher time frame

692
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,220
bias not understanding what the

693
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,880
likelihood of a large range would do

694
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,039
for your trading and your equity

695
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,320
and you don't need to have a full

696
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,600
positional like this is my initial entry

697
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,940
usually it's six contracts

698
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,179
I was tempted to go in and do four more

699
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,860
here I said you know I'm just going to

700
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,419
leave it there I'm gonna leave it there

701
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,480
and I'm not going to worry about it

702
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,100
and while I was out doing what I wanted

703
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,080
to do today the market just kept on

704
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
plowing higher smashing everybody that

705
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
was wanting to go short

706
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,120
on the heels of

707
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,919
they're going to use the retail sales

708
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,440
number and then going into 9 30. drop it

709
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,620
down create relatively close rally it

710
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,580
sharply

711
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,020
fair value

712
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,460
sales off

713
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,000
now retail doesn't want to be long so as

714
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,640
long as they're afraid to buy it that's

715
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,120
a welcoming feeling for me with a smart

716
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,000
money mindset with trading I want to go

717
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,900
in when they're fearful

718
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,740
what time do we trade for a silver

719
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,940
bullet 10 o'clock to 11. displacement

720
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,679
down closed candle as it's trading down

721
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,480
I'm buying it

722
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,860
this right here could have been another

723
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,320
four contracts

724
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
and then I'd have my full 10 positions

725
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,460
this is my standard model for trading

726
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,440
index futures

727
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,960
and then rallied up I'm not from the

728
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,260
charts my stop loss is below

729
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,600
this candle is low right there

730
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,279
that's where the stop was

731
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,020
and you've seen me use tighter stop

732
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,700
losses than that

733
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,620
but it went down into the Fairbank Gap

734
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,340
there

735
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,740
if I would have saw that I would have

736
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,779
did another entry just to prove to you I

737
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,340
was trusting the pattern but I wasn't

738
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,320
there I wasn't watching the chart at the

739
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,980
time

740
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,640
and just keep on moving up and because I

741
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
wasn't in front of the charts and

742
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,940
because you wouldn't be in from the

743
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,380
charts when you're training yourself to

744
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,000
do this you put a position on and you

745
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,220
just let it go if it stops you it stops

746
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,360
you out it's not gonna be the last trick

747
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,559
you ever take

748
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,659
but you have to condition yourself like

749
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,340
this to hold on to it for a long period

750
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,200
of time by not looking at the chart

751
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
because it's real easy to see this thing

752
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
okay okay I made a lot of money now let

753
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,799
me just get out of it no

754
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,899
trust time of day

755
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,760
trust it

756
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,500
and the market just explodes higher

757
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,549
[Music]

758
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,039
hopefully found this one insightful and

759
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,539
it was beneficial to you obviously it's

760
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,340
just an introduction to my ICT Rebrand

761
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,380
version favorite you got I'll have more

762
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,179
talk about that in the book I won't be

763
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,260
releasing anymore because I already know

764
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,399
somebody's going to come out here maybe

765
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,960
many of you you're going to come out

766
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,460
there and try to create little tutorials

767
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,020
on YouTube and misinform everyone

768
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,039
because you don't know what you're doing

769
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,140
please don't try to do that okay I

770
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,340
understand you want clicks and all that

771
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,020
stuff but uh you don't know what you're

772
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,279
doing and you don't know what I'm going

773
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,080
to teach about that very specific PDA

774
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,279
rate but I want to introduce it today

775
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,260
and I hope you found it inspiring and

776
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,720
interesting until talk to you next time

777
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,440
be safe
