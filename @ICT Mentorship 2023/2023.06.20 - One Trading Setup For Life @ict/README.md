#PreviousDayPMSession ==>  13:30 to 16:00 time window  (#RTH = #RegularTradingHours)  

#RTH  
1. it cuts out all the overnight Trading  
2. the algorithm once we start #RTH session the next Day, it's going to refer back to #PreviousDayPMSession  
3. the algorithm seek for liquidity exists above and below #RTH  

1. if you are bullish   
2. and trading in close proximity to the #PreviousDayPMSession   
3. and we take out the PreviousDayPMSession low (#SSL)  
4. and we have a #HTF premises expecting the market to go higher   
5. smart money would accumulate those #SSL and absorb it for their buy side 




LONDON SESSION RAID: 2:00 AM TO 5:00 AM
    I look at PM session range
    if it's not a factor or it's not to be considered because we're not in close proximity to that range because we could be significantly higher or lower around 9 30.

    so what am I looking for then if I'm not close to previous PM session 130 P.M to 4 P.M range
    at the time of 9 30 at the opening bell, and I'm watching that next 30 minutes, which is the opening range
    
    what am I going to look for then next if it's not that
    I'm looking at the London session raid
    that means I'm going to be looking at the range between two o'clock in the morning and five o'clock in the morning New York local time now again
