1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,760
all right folks welcome back

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,900
this is a weekly review

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,599
of the dollar Index Euro

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,900
es and the NASDAQ

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,000
so we're looking at the weekly chart of

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,480
the dollar Index if you did not watch

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,980
July 9th 2023's market review videos on

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,539
the YouTube channel

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,820
uh go back and watch that first because

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,660
without having seen that first

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,460
you're really not going to fully

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,620
appreciate what's being shared here okay

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,160
so I'm going to assume that you are

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,540
going to stop the video and go watch

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,860
that one or you're really not gonna do

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,960
very well in terms of

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,120
benefiting from what was shown before

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,860
the fact

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,500
so we talked about

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,120
this fair value Gap here on the weekly

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,120
chart this is completely permissible for

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,920
price to do this type of thing looking

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,540
through it

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,159
and I mentioned that we would likely

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,420
draw

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,700
to the sell side below here

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,619
and then below here

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,439
it got a little animated on the downside

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,240
and I'll take your attention right over

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
here it was just I think one tick or so

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,320
short of actually reaching the high

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,439
of the Gap and this is

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,100
from the week beginning April 11 2022

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,619
okay so that's this week right here

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,640
and the week beginning March 28 2022 the

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,600
high

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,640
of that candle so that makes that fair

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,860
value Gap here and say five seven

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,840
balance outside efficiency

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
so we'll watch and see if it wants to

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,740
dig into that going into this week apart

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,299
from that I don't really have a whole

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,259
lot

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,540
this year in terms of prognostication I

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,100
give you

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,100
a barn burner last Sunday and it pretty

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,100
much was very explosive this past week

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,200
daily chart

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,099
okay in the commentary in July 9th 2023s

50
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,640
Sunday review and Analysis before the

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
market even opened up

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
I mentioned that this is the breaker

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,020
that you're going to be watching and

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,700
this is where we had closed for that

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,040
particular week

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,040
we opened traded up into the breaker

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,780
okay and what I'm showing you here is

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,980
the low

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,160
to the high mid point of that is mean

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
threshold order blocks the midpoint is

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
mean threshold gaps are inefficiencies

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,500
the midpoint is consequent encroachment

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,239
you can see we traded up into it here

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,819
hits it beautifully then delivery to the

65
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,959
downside

66
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,000
so there's Mondays trading Tuesday we

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,739
finally made our way into

68
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,900
this fair value Gap

69
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
and accelerated to the downside

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,560
attacking the sell side as I've

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
mentioned we would likely do if we

72
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,680
traded

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,800
accordingly on Monday go back and listen

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,879
to

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,459
July 9th 2023's analysis before the

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,959
market opened up

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
we were anticipating the return back

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
into this breaker does it deliver

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
off that breaker yes so that means we

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,659
can anticipate this area here

81
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,019
sell side draw okay

82
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm just going to toss this in here

83
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,440
because you know I see a lot of comments

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,019
that people share with me that Me Maybe

85
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,060
are being made in other YouTubers

86
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,239
comment section sometimes it does appear

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,239
in my own comment section yes I can see

88
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,860
your comments it looks like the comment

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,200
section is open but what it is that I

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,760
have it set for review

91
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,340
and it's it's for me to read them their

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,099
personal messages to me okay so to keep

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,019
the people with a lot of uh hurt

94
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,640
feelings when there's a lot of adoration

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,220
shared towards me to prevent them from

96
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,319
being harmed or having their their

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,180
feelings hurt by seeing other people

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,400
appreciate what I've done for them I I

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
keep these messages private I've done it

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,500
in the past I've showed you why I keep

101
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,480
it private and when I open them up

102
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,340
publicly everybody pretty much was it

103
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,739
was like a sugar Fest but sometimes I'll

104
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,840
get a comment saying that I'm teaching

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
like for instance the sell side here

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,939
there's they'll suggest that I'm calling

107
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,279
sell side support

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,820
um no I'm teaching you to view how the

109
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,460
market will draw to that liquidity to it

110
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,840
and through it

111
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,960
okay to it and through it buy side is

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
not resistance buy side is a draw on

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,280
liquidity

114
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,020
for markets that are going to go higher

115
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,660
we want to tap into that by side

116
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,699
liquidity that's above old highs

117
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,220
relative equal highs or single highs

118
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,900
so it's not a matter of support and

119
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,160
resistance support and resistance is

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,199
garbage okay let's just be real Frank

121
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,080
with one another here I don't believe in

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,180
support and resistance but I have

123
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,580
methods that will teach you real Dynamic

124
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,840
support resistance and that's my

125
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,580
inefficiencies and gaps

126
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,919
okay so the way I use gaps they're not

127
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,259
filled and done away with the market

128
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,940
many times will revert back to an old

129
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,520
gaps high low or consequent encroachment

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
so we don't do trading in supply and

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
demand zones with whether it's ambiguous

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,320
you know or you have to determine where

133
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
you're going to buy or sell based on

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,780
that theory

135
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,820
there's three specific price levels that

136
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,759
I'm looking at I'd like to see and if

137
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm going to use the range for targeting

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,460
for determining whether or not the

139
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,100
inefficiency is going to provide a means

140
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,660
of

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,020
stating off continuation then I'll put

142
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
the four gradients on that level too so

143
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,340
it's either

144
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,139
I'm looking for it as a Target or I'm

145
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
looking for it as a entry

146
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,300
and vice versa so we're not looking at

147
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,000
this level here anticipating this to be

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,039
some measure of support to buy from

149
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,740
that's not what I'm doing and that's the

150
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,539
infancy of most of these individuals

151
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,639
that are on the internet they will look

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,680
at something and it resembles because I

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,900
have a rectangle or I'm drawing a line

154
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,460
on that old load so they think naturally

155
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,479
that's

156
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,060
what I'm looking for is a buy there I

157
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
don't believe in that theory I I attack

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,479
old mode okay I don't look at trying to

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,800
find some reason to buy down here

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,080
because the market went up there before

161
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,780
I teach you to anticipate that the

162
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,940
retail Traders with that mindset they're

163
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
going to want to buy there

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,479
and the people that are already long

165
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,520
they have stops orders below there what

166
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,620
kind of stops sell stops so that's

167
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,020
perfect for me if I'm short because I'm

168
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,500
going to buy below those loads

169
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,380
not at those lows I want to go through

170
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,479
them and reach for some targets beyond

171
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,780
that so it's nonsensical to try to say

172
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,759
that what I'm teaching you is classic

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,560
smart resistance because I absolutely do

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
not have any faith in that at all and

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
you shouldn't either

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
so the breaker in here

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,560
you can see we hit that and we worked

178
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,180
off that Weekly fair value Gap and I

179
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,880
mentioned in the July 9th video that it

180
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
doesn't look like there's a gap at all

181
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
in here which is the reason why you want

182
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,600
to transpose your weekly inefficiencies

183
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,740
onto your daily chart

184
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,740
and you won't lose sight of what the

185
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,479
higher time frame context is if you do

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,800
that all right let's move on over to

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,960
euro

188
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,660
so you're a Dollar weekly chart I've

189
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,400
been counseling you all for months now

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,819
to anticipate this

191
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,180
weekly volume and balance okay so yes

192
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,979
this is not in any of your textbooks

193
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,840
it's not supplying demand it's not like

194
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,580
off it's not anything else out there

195
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,759
okay you can see how the market has

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,800
drawn price up into that that's

197
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,960
algorithmic price action you will not

198
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,720
find a retail book a retail educator you

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
will not find anybody that's going to

200
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,560
teach you to anticipate the market

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,780
wanting to go back into this area

202
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,940
they don't see it that way Steve Nielsen

203
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,080
would have never talked about this and

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,259
he's Mr candlestick okay so I say all

205
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,120
these things and for some of you it gets

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,860
under your your skin when I when I do

207
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,560
this I'm not trying to sound

208
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,680
right okay I'm not trying to belittle

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,500
anybody else but I have a constant flow

210
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,020
of new viewers

211
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,060
that will come to me in the previous

212
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,300
video or the video before it and they'll

213
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,340
say you know this looks like that or

214
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,680
this looks like this or this seems like

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,780
it's a rebranding or renaming of this or

216
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,660
that I'm going to challenge you to go

217
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,520
out and find these things

218
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,300
the way I use them okay

219
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,659
you're not going to find it prior to me

220
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,059
so I would love nothing more to be able

221
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,919
to point to someone else and say this

222
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,779
person taught me this so that way I

223
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,580
don't have to make all these videos okay

224
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,339
but it's nonsensical for any of you to

225
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,440
sit here and try to wrestle with the

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,779
idea that this has been rebranded from

227
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,100
from anything else out there because

228
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,500
this is nothing like anything else this

229
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,660
is the marketplace it's algorithmically

230
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,839
delivered AI runs the show here and

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,300
sometimes manual intervention steps in

232
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,120
and you you probably aren't going to

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
make money and if I traded that day I

234
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
probably would lose money too

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,000
so you have to submit yourself to that

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,640
potential risk and all of us understand

237
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,920
that especially if you're trading with

238
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,420
real money because you signed the risk

239
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,580
disclosures when you do so so we looked

240
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,800
at this weekly inversion fair value you

241
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,880
got okay and this again is not a

242
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,120
liquidity void find a sell signal here

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,260
and sell off that's not what you're

244
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,600
looking for okay we are looking for this

245
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
level to act as support so that's what

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,180
makes this a ICT inversion fair value

247
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
cap right and you can see how we opened

248
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,080
for the week we traded down admittedly

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,839
we did not match the low of this candle

250
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,640
with the low of that one don't so don't

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,440
don't be fooled by the visual

252
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
representation that's being shown here

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
but for the spread

254
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,680
you would have been you know you would

255
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,700
have been stopped out if you were long

256
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,620
this has been honest

257
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,240
the broker would open the spread up on

258
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,220
you and you would have been tagged and

259
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,899
stopped out before you would have been

260
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,120
capturing that move but the idea was I

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,220
was teaching you on Sunday July 9th 2023

262
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,519
that it would trade down to that and

263
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,260
then run up to the buy side here and

264
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,899
into this weekly volume and balance

265
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,240
I don't know folks this does your chart

266
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
show this I mean if you post

267
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,060
the euro dollar in your trading platform

268
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,800
and you put it on a weekly chart does it

269
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
look like this

270
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,519
do you have a huge big bullish candle

271
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,339
that closed on the high

272
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,080
I don't know you gotta decide whether or

273
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,360
not this is all made up or Cherry Picked

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
or whatnot but let's drop down to a

275
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,459
daily chart here

276
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,380
okay you see Mondays trading we opened

277
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,740
traded down towards the weekly inversion

278
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,839
fair value Gap

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,399
rallies

280
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,500
Tuesday we have a small little end of

281
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,120
decisive day

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
and then explosion on Wednesday

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,940
taking the buy side and trading rates of

284
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,500
the low looking very close right at the

285
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
low the weekly volume and balance and

286
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,160
then we open

287
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,899
find some support at the weekly volume

288
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,660
balance rallies

289
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,860
Friday we have a little bit of

290
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,140
continuation so the only thing I have

291
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,000
going into this week is I want to see it

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,820
completely close that in that's it

293
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,620
now

294
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,060
when I

295
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,120
share my analysis and the market runs

296
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,680
through these levels and it delivers as

297
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,820
a hotline

298
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,160
invariably and there's a small sect of

299
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,899
my community that will come out and go

300
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,220
right to Twitter and say okay what's

301
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,380
next what's it going to do next it's

302
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,519
like

303
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,079
I don't know if they're just waiting for

304
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
me to get it wrong okay and they want to

305
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,079
hurry up and get to the next one where I

306
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,240
can potentially get it wrong or

307
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,800
they're just not satisfied with this

308
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,620
event for study purposes there's so much

309
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,920
to go into this with and study like

310
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,380
there's so much detail going in in mine

311
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,959
for your own edification

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,959
and wasting it just looking for the next

313
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,120
opportunities so you can either

314
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,820
you know dog pile on the idea that I'm

315
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,500
expecting it to go higher or lower and

316
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,480
you try to find setups in that you

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,760
really like learning just with that you

318
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
got to go into and

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,120
back test all these individual days

320
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,460
individual trading sessions

321
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,800
[Music]

322
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,000
all right so here's the hourly chart

323
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
here and you can see how we just fell

324
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,440
short if you look real close we just

325
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,980
fell short

326
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,180
before touching the high end of that

327
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,519
Weekly inversion fair value go

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,079
and the market rallied

329
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,860
came back down found some support

330
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,779
great interfere Vega

331
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,519
rallies again

332
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,920
comes into another

333
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,040
you got and rallies and right in here it

334
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,959
creates

335
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,639
the measuring Gap

336
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,200
what makes this a measuring Gap well

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,639
we're anticipating price getting as high

338
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,380
as this shaded area up here which is a

339
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,420
weekly volume of balance and we

340
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,959
anticipated this here acting as what

341
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,899
some measure of instigation of a new

342
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,220
rally

343
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,220
so to speak in simple terms for you this

344
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,600
is not classic support and resistance

345
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,399
but I'm going to use the idea so that

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,540
way you can follow along in terms of

347
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,240
context we anticipated the top of this

348
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,519
area here that's shaded in Orange

349
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,680
I guess it's really not orange is it

350
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,200
it's a hue that's very close to Orange

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
and then we expected that to act as

352
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,740
support and then we would look to see it

353
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,959
get to this level here which is the old

354
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,660
buy side liquidity we didn't see it

355
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,279
going there and then coming back down we

356
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,899
did not talk about that I did not say

357
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,760
that was going to happen I said that we

358
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,220
would go to that through it and then

359
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,980
trade into this range now what what

360
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,600
levels am I talking about when we get

361
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,160
into these ranges I'm going to cover

362
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,540
that in a moment but let's go into a

363
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,040
little bit more details here

364
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,779
15-minute time frame

365
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,820
you can see two down closed candles here

366
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,740
that's a bullish order block consecutive

367
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,120
down closed candles

368
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,519
small little Gap there extend that

369
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
forward you can see how the market

370
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079
trades down into that and then rallies

371
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,300
inversion fair value got Market find

372
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,540
support there rallies up I have lessons

373
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,940
and lectures and discussions with

374
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,560
inversion repair banking apps so you'll

375
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
understand more about that

376
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,459
you know but just let's get through this

377
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,320
year going through some examples because

378
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm laying down a lot of foundation

379
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
and you're not going to learn this with

380
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,260
one video okay so I've said this many

381
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,180
times before the five minute trainer

382
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
guys out there to try to take my content

383
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,959
and make Cliff Notes out of it you're

384
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,940
not going to teach anybody efficiently

385
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,320
doing that but you can get a lot of

386
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,079
clicks doing it so here's that measuring

387
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,260
Gap

388
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,240
moves up into the low of the weekly

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
volume of balance and then we find

390
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
support at the weekly volume balance you

391
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,420
see that look at that that's beautiful

392
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,699
now if you would have never known about

393
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,860
the weekly volume abounds you would

394
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,420
never have seen that as a level to

395
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,920
anticipate the market wanting to go

396
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,940
higher

397
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,860
Mark calls back down into a small little

398
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,959
Gap in here

399
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,660
rallies again right in here we have a

400
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,880
bullshore block

401
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,440
right to extend the hearing optimal

402
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,480
trade entry as well and then it rallies

403
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,639
and continuously moves higher I've seen

404
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,660
a couple tweets that people were

405
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,279
complaining how you know the market did

406
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,320
in fact go where we were expecting it to

407
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,699
go from July 9th 2023's analysis

408
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,399
video shared on my YouTube channel

409
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,139
but they never mentioned you many times

410
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,720
not having a way to get into the trade

411
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,139
okay and this is the easiest ones that

412
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,000
are in the chart there's lots of other

413
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,339
smaller time frame entries that could

414
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,959
have been utilized okay and if you don't

415
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,940
see that that's okay it's because you're

416
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,639
still learning but this was a very fast

417
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,060
Market it was doing very sudden runs

418
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,160
and

419
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,380
we have a lot of things going on

420
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,019
and the way money is being transferred

421
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,320
uh is fundamentally changing so that

422
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,380
speeds up things a lot more

423
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,740
well expediently and you're seeing that

424
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,600
reaction here and there's a lot of other

425
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,860
things that's going on on the other side

426
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
of the world that's probably going to be

427
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,579
a burdensome thing for all of us but

428
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,839
we'll leave that out of the discussion

429
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,579
for now for your homework

430
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,160
as an additional study you want to take

431
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,260
this weekly volume imbalance and lay

432
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,300
your Fibonacci on it from the high to

433
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,740
the low make sure you get the actual

434
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,899
High and the low shown from the weekly

435
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:16,920
chart

436
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,899
that makes this weekly volume of ounce

437
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,220
so I'll just go back and watch the

438
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,240
beginning of the video you'll see the

439
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,459
candles I'm drawing from you can do a

440
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,279
Fibonacci overlay that has the zero 100

441
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,600
level

442
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,360
and then 0.25

443
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
0.50

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,639
0.75 and study where we are on the lower

445
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,259
time frames like one minute five minute

446
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,259
charts every time we traded at

447
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,639
or near

448
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,579
the 25

449
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:47,100
gradient to 50 gradient in the 75

450
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,820
gradient

451
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,300
all right moving on into enemy s p this

452
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,300
is the seasonal tendency chart for

453
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,820
e-mini s p

454
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,279
and I'm gonna take you back in time

455
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,899
for a couple minutes in our conversation

456
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,900
here and I talked about how I like

457
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,780
seeing the seasonal tendency that comes

458
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,400
in in the month of May leading into June

459
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,740
June typically makes a really strong low

460
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,380
and that's just about every single year

461
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,780
okay that one's really really strong but

462
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,419
I like having a shorting opportunity

463
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,880
going into the last week of April going

464
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,080
into May and then majority of may we see

465
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,220
some

466
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,080
measure of selling well this year while

467
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,299
we were anticipating it the market

468
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,500
internals did not present that idea in

469
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
technicals so while I was expecting and

470
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,360
looking for it we didn't do anything

471
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,039
that would get us short and take a loss

472
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,799
what we were doing is we were seeing the

473
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,900
market show us that it's not likely that

474
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,700
the season tendency was coming into

475
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,160
fruition this year so this little

476
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,620
movement right in here okay

477
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,320
that's what I was looking at that is a

478
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,799
really easy bread winner for the

479
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,240
springtime

480
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,820
and it was not there technically but I

481
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,640
want to take your attention into

482
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,380
how the third week of May

483
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,419
and third week of June okay see how we

484
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,960
have June July May April

485
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,760
this is approximately the third week of

486
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,299
May and the third week of June see that

487
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,660
this right here tends to be one of the

488
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,360
best times to be a buyer of index

489
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,580
futures for e-mini s p

490
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,840
so if you're looking for a really strong

491
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,660
mid-year point to buy if you are in a

492
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,160
bull market that you feel that is going

493
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,020
to continue because we didn't see a

494
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,900
seasonal tendency come to fruition here

495
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,179
okay and I counseled you to do this in

496
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,980
my mentorship

497
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,620
and you view the seasonal Tendencies if

498
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,179
they don't form

499
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,559
if they don't come to fruition that's

500
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,580
telling you something that's extremely

501
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,220
fundamental to the next Drive higher or

502
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,440
lower

503
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
if it's not moving in tandem with what

504
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,400
you would expect in terms of the

505
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,860
seasonal tendency that means it's doing

506
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,620
something opposite

507
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,660
so if we're anticipating what lower

508
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,840
prices for ES or e-mini s p and it's not

509
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,700
willing to do this that means we're

510
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
extremely bullish

511
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,020
so go into your charts on the third week

512
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,900
of May in the third week of June if you

513
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,940
like these charts by the way uh these

514
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,640
are old friends of mine these these

515
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,179
charts have been with me since 1995 and

516
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,380
this company uh it's headed by Steve

517
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,720
Moore and if you like seasonal

518
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,980
Tendencies or if you want to delve into

519
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,600
that his website is

520
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,140
www.mrci.com I do not get anything for

521
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,760
telling you that I don't have an

522
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,620
affiliation with him uh he probably

523
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,080
doesn't even know who I am I've sent a

524
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,000
ton of people to him

525
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,740
uh Steve if you're listening you're

526
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,580
welcome

527
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
um I just think that he is the Pinnacle

528
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,520
of all seasonal tendency work I don't

529
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,559
care who it is I don't care who you like

530
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,340
okay I don't care his research his work

531
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,740
is in my opinion Superior to everything

532
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,179
and everyone else

533
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,480
so that's why I use his resources for

534
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,820
looking at seasonal tendencies

535
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,919
there is no business relationship

536
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,140
between them not okay but if you want

537
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,960
seasonal tendency charts

538
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,700
his is the best that's my opinion

539
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,960
all right so here's a weekly chart of

540
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,299
e-mini s p this is a September contract

541
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,179
for 2023 and there is the weekly volume

542
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,820
and balance I mentioned multiple times

543
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,740
and I said right between these two

544
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,480
levels here

545
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,020
that point is the exposed area where

546
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,480
there is no

547
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,980
volume

548
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,039
so there's a real Gap there okay so that

549
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,120
makes it what

550
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,880
a liquidity board that my friends is a

551
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,360
liquidity void this from here to here

552
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,200
that is not a liquid okay

553
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,900
it's it's been unfortunately

554
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,580
called that

555
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,220
and because I wanted to teach on baby

556
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,380
Pips I stuck with the binocular that

557
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,000
other people were using because you know

558
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,740
why reinvent the wheel and try to cause

559
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,179
more confusion because at the time I

560
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,400
didn't want to go this far in teaching

561
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,220
but a real liquidity void is a void of

562
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,840
liquidity

563
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,760
all liquidity

564
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,140
so

565
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,299
that's what distinguishes me from

566
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,799
everybody else out there because I will

567
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,860
tell you this is an inefficiency it's a

568
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,500
sell side imbalance

569
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,320
buy side inefficiency

570
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,220
so it's inefficient in up

571
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,220
or by side offering the market only went

572
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,620
one side ahead of handily and it's more

573
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,020
likely to offer movement on the upside

574
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,580
and we see that over here on this this

575
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,200
camera easy one of these candles as a

576
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,840
weekly Candlestick by the way so we

577
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,919
traded

578
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,840
up into this

579
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,340
Gap

580
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,140
or real liquidity will be between this

581
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,700
week's low and this week's High

582
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,280
majority of the entire weekly volume and

583
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,080
balance so we finally got to that one

584
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,360
okay

585
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,880
let's take a closer look

586
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,100
right inside that small little Gap okay

587
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,159
so before I go to the next slide in our

588
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,720
presentation here I want you to

589
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,100
understand that what I'm going to do is

590
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,860
I'm going to zoom in to this small

591
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,900
little segment of price action and I'm

592
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
going to show you the relationship

593
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,280
between this week's low here this candle

594
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,559
in this week's High

595
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
we're going to measure that with the

596
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,380
Fibonacci and we're going to get the

597
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,700
midpoint of that which is consequent

598
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,200
encouragement because it's a gap

599
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,760
here we are zoomed in here's that

600
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,280
Candlestick we were looking at the low

601
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,419
for Monday April 4th okay that week of

602
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,480
2022 and then the 18th of April 2022. so

603
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,940
this candlesticks high of its respective

604
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,760
weekly candle this candle sticks low of

605
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,460
its respective weekly candle

606
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,280
drawing our Fib from that level to there

607
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
all we're doing we're using the FIB to

608
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,900
get a perfect halfway point fifty

609
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,980
percent that means 45 59 and a half

610
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,960
that is your consequent encouragement of

611
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
that small little Gap that's right here

612
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
that little Gap okay so I'm finding half

613
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,240
of this between this red line and that

614
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,980
red line I want to know what the

615
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,919
midpoint of that is the exact midpoint

616
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,039
that's what's being shown here 4 500 59

617
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,260
and a half

618
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,480
taking us over to the current present

619
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,700
week you can see how we traded right up

620
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,200
into that consequent encouragement here

621
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
a little above it just by a little bit

622
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,380
but look how beautiful the reaction was

623
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,200
from here back down in and we closed on

624
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
the highs not at the highs we just fell

625
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,720
short of going into the 20 retracement

626
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,780
for TGIF all right so let's go into a

627
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,840
daily chart here you can see the

628
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,580
if everybody got we mentioned that at

629
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,919
the time two down closed candles that's

630
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,600
your bullish order block extend that to

631
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,960
the right we had a start of the week we

632
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,100
traded down

633
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,280
into the order block and then ripped

634
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,500
higher ticking out by side digging into

635
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,240
the low of the weekly volume and balance

636
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
the consequent encroachment of the

637
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,559
entire shaded area which is the weekly

638
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,480
volume of balance and in those two red

639
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,159
levels up here and then it's respective

640
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
consequent approach or midpoint of that

641
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
Gap that's being shown within the weekly

642
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,980
volume of balance just a really

643
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,700
beautiful delivery for ES this week

644
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,780
NASDAQ was actually better but and we'll

645
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,539
look at that in a moment but let's drop

646
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,340
into a lower time frame here for the

647
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,159
hourly chart on ES

648
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,440
you see how we dropped down into your

649
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,360
block rally through

650
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,039
bull shorter block this is down close

651
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,080
here and we have a fair value Gap that

652
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,280
makes this a

653
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,539
proper

654
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,100
little shorter block

655
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,440
because we're in context of a buy

656
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,760
program we're looking for higher prices

657
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,220
everything should match there and we've

658
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,960
seen a noon

659
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,159
lunchtime New York local time

660
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,720
return back in to in Balance order block

661
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,880
sell side taken flow relative equal lows

662
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
and then starts to trade higher

663
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,279
another order block here trades higher

664
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,020
an aggressive run through the short-term

665
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,039
High here

666
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,620
so we're not looking at that as buy side

667
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,200
which is resistance right no we're

668
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,900
looking at it going to it being drawn to

669
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,600
that area and then through it

670
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,279
and I don't need it to trade back down

671
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,480
to this high

672
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,100
that's classic support and resistance I

673
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,240
don't need that

674
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,820
I want to see a trade inside of this

675
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,500
inefficiency right here

676
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,620
right there right in here that's

677
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,080
institutional order called entry drill

678
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,539
and then rallies again trades up into

679
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,700
that Weekly volume of balance

680
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,500
look at the bodies respecting the weekly

681
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,700
volume imbalance

682
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
yes we have these little Mohawks that's

683
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,480
in air price action it's normal to see

684
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,919
that it's perfectly normal and

685
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,779
acceptable

686
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,400
Market rallies

687
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,260
trades up into

688
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,820
the consequent encouragement of that

689
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,820
actual liquidity void in the upper

690
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,799
portion of that shaded pink area which

691
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,299
is a weekly volume imbalance

692
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,919
here's a five minute chart you can see

693
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,200
again with the es trading up internet

694
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,419
consequent encouragement of the actual

695
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,240
liquidity void at the entire portion of

696
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,460
that Weekly volume imbalance and right

697
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,440
in here you can see small little sibi

698
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
which is a fair bag you got it's also

699
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,320
gonna bounce efficiency yeah it means

700
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,640
the market will likely pull back up into

701
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,419
that

702
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,159
it does essentially the consequent

703
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,419
encroachment we can see those

704
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,760
measurements here Trace to it here and

705
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
then we want to see a sharp displacement

706
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,740
lower do we get it yes did it take out a

707
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,740
short term level yes what is this that's

708
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,360
the 2022 model I taught you on this

709
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,620
YouTube channel

710
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,380
very Gap trades up into it here boom

711
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,600
that's too short what do you aim for the

712
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,640
low under here

713
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,679
delivers and we have a small little Fair

714
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
bag up there

715
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,580
offering the two o'clock Silver Bullet

716
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,039
the market breaks lower relative equal

717
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,740
lows we pull back up retraces and then

718
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,840
aggressively runs lower off of hitting a

719
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,919
breaker

720
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,799
high low higher high this candles your

721
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,260
breaker trades to it here

722
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,659
sells off going into the three o'clock

723
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,760
hour small little fare bag you got there

724
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
as well so we have high low return back

725
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
in this is model 22 again

726
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,779
cell site hammers it in the final hour

727
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,580
of trading on Friday

728
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,279
all right here's NASDAQ this is our

729
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,940
weekly chart on NAS so you can see the

730
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,539
weekly fair value Gap there

731
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,840
you trade down into that two weeks ago

732
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,419
and this is this present week so we

733
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,820
opened traded down aggressively moved

734
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,080
higher

735
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
made it high and then come off the highs

736
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,980
I want to zoom in on that

737
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,779
so we're zoomed in on the weekly chart

738
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,380
for Nas and I'm taking the Fibonacci and

739
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,820
measuring from the low of the week to

740
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,500
the high of the week and I'm showing you

741
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,000
the respective

742
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,380
20 and 30 which is TGIF so whenever you

743
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,659
have a nice big run higher or lower

744
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,340
those are the times you want to look for

745
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,620
TGIF they're really

746
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,159
likely to have these pullbacks towards

747
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,299
the end of the week

748
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,179
and how far will it pull back 20 to 30

749
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,679
percent of the work the weekly range

750
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,760
entirely so you can see that 15 698 and

751
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,900
a half

752
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,500
is 20 of the weekly range for Nasdaq so

753
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,760
that level is going to be important

754
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
going forward in this presentation so 15

755
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,480
698 and a half

756
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,039
that levels being noted here and it's

757
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,980
the weekly TGIF 20 it's a short little

758
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,020
abbreviation for thank God it's Friday

759
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,640
okay so it's a way for you to remember

760
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,440
that that model

761
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,159
is a day of week specific model and it's

762
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,419
capitalizing on treating a reversal

763
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,720
of the entire weekly range to a 20 to 30

764
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,480
percent level of the entire weekly range

765
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,340
I got a teaching on it this is the first

766
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,899
time you heard about it just go on my

767
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,279
YouTube channel and you'll find a TGIF

768
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
setup

769
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,960
all right so let's go into the hourly

770
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,720
chart okay so we're going right to the

771
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,460
Brass tax with this because it's already

772
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,140
a long video

773
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,640
I want you to take a look at the low

774
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,720
here

775
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,080
the high and the lower low

776
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,179
in the market trades through this High

777
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,520
we don't look at that as resistance okay

778
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
there's buy side above that and we're

779
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,840
looking for higher prices beyond that

780
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,480
but what can we use this information for

781
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,080
in terms of finding range

782
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,480
well if you look at the teaching I gave

783
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
you on Advanced ICT Breakers

784
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,419
those ideas that I shared in that video

785
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,299
I'm applying it here so

786
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:15,000
when we see the stop run here

787
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,179
that takes out the sell side below here

788
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,320
my eye goes right to the low to the high

789
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,020
prior to the lower load it qualifies

790
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,899
this as a bullish ICT breaker

791
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,919
so this is your measuring range

792
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,720
so you take your Fibonacci apply it to

793
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,620
the low

794
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,740
to the high extend it do multiple

795
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,260
extensions you can do extension standard

796
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,779
deviation negative one

797
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,340
here negative

798
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,100
standard deviation two

799
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,320
comes in at what price

800
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,480
fifteen thousand eight hundred and fifty

801
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,410
six and a quarter

802
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,659
[Music]

803
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,580
it's not the actual high but look how

804
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,620
close it gets you

805
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,200
that's projecting a weekly Range High

806
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,820
now there's people out there who say oh

807
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,559
well you know you can't do that ICP

808
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,120
nobody can do that the Market's too

809
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,620
random nope nobody can do that well I'm

810
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,840
teaching you tools and Concepts that you

811
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,480
know I've been shown in my private group

812
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,659
doing this years and years of it

813
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,179
now my students can do it

814
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,580
you're learning how I'm able to do it

815
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,500
it's not imperative that you do this

816
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,059
every single week okay when the

817
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,620
technicals are there and you have a

818
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,080
strong bias that is

819
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,600
conducive for these ideas to pan out

820
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,840
that's when you want to do it okay so

821
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
this breaker we expected to trade

822
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
through it it does we come back down

823
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,659
into it the bodies are respecting the

824
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,580
breaker it's not the fact that it goes

825
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,559
up to this high and it repels price has

826
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,480
absolutely nothing to do with it has

827
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,919
nothing to do with it because if that's

828
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,840
the case why didn't it do it to him this

829
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,299
High that's the fallacy of retail

830
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,860
support and resistance ideas if you're

831
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,120
going to look at this High here and say

832
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,399
ICT is cherry picking because it's it

833
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,059
worked there well use that same logic in

834
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,340
in saying that this is rebranded because

835
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,860
it's not why don't you apply it to that

836
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,480
high there because it had a nice

837
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,279
retracement off of it too

838
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,200
so why is price not showing any

839
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,260
willingness or respect of it over here

840
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,419
I think because it has nothing to do

841
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,480
with why price goes up or down

842
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,620
the logic is this

843
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,419
short-term entries

844
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,940
those that are in in the pursuit of

845
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,640
trying to go long they were right

846
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,620
prematurely

847
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,600
until they were stopped out

848
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,799
so this perfect trap here

849
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,500
sets the stage for those individuals

850
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,820
that got stopped out trying to get along

851
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,440
they're too afraid to get back in

852
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
especially when this one more Wipeout

853
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,140
that takes out this low which also took

854
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,620
out that lap so we see a one two three

855
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,260
drives pattern that is a classic retail

856
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,480
pattern yes it does work if you have the

857
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,279
context you know in the drawing liquid

858
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,500
and where you're trying to aim for if

859
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,179
that's correct that pattern will work

860
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,720
for you if you see a level or a

861
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,140
direction fail after three attempts and

862
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,820
it breaks down and if you see a breaker

863
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,880
or a model 2022 inside of that

864
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,600
wow what a beautiful model I probably

865
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,399
said too much but

866
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,140
anyway

867
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,179
the Longs that have a cell stop below

868
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,620
here they get stopped out they're not

869
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,820
going to go back in they're scared

870
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,899
they're not going to get back in there

871
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,880
but now the market will revert back to

872
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,940
the individuals that are short here

873
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,980
someone's short so they're going to run

874
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,840
on them so the sales thoughts are being

875
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,539
accumulated by smart money going long

876
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,279
they're buying those cell stops with the

877
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,159
purpose of off setting

878
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,260
so offset distribution is being used

879
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,000
above this High that's not support

880
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,500
resistance that's selling above a level

881
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,320
for profit taking and waiting for

882
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,880
confirmation that it wants to go higher

883
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,200
it does

884
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
the bodies are respecting that high

885
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
which is a breaker

886
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,600
it's not showing any willingness to show

887
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,580
the bodies respecting this High anywhere

888
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,119
in here as support it's not happening

889
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,520
so the market resumes going higher pay

890
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
no attention to this level yet because

891
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,179
it has to make a high of the week first

892
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,339
so when we have this big capitulation

893
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,580
this is run up into a standard deviation

894
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,859
of negative two on this range which is

895
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,418
what I taught

896
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,839
on that Advanced breaker video that just

897
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,699
literally just did it like a week or so

898
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,099
ago on YouTube channel so watch that one

899
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,599
and you'll see me teaching this very

900
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,239
premise

901
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
that is beautiful delivery folks I'm

902
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,918
sorry I hate to break your hearts okay

903
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm not trying to be mean but this stuff

904
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,239
isn't in your books okay and if someone

905
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,619
goes out there and they want to run out

906
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,199
make a Amazon book and try to include

907
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,179
this you're going to be coming up short

908
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,918
changed because there's a lot of things

909
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,199
I'm leaving for this idea for my own

910
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,639
book

911
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,260
so sorry

912
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,060
not sorry then we have these relative

913
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,380
equal lows

914
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,060
and the market draws down into that in

915
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,740
latter portion of the day but back down

916
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,900
more specifically into the weekly TGIF

917
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,140
20 so after we see this level hit we

918
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,480
want to see does it really wanna

919
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,180
break down from that and then when we

920
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,200
look at the lower time frames we

921
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,040
actually will see that actually

922
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,640
occurring

923
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,780
so here's the 15 minute time frame

924
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,579
here's the consolidation in the

925
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,839
beginning of the day

926
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,300
and we had a report come out

927
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,339
sends price higher

928
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:32,820
then we have this Gap right there

929
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,579
okay so this return back into this

930
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,260
sibi which is a cell sign of balance by

931
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,140
deficiency Market trades into it here we

932
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,640
Wick past it that's completely

933
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
permissible

934
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,320
breaks down again we have another Gap so

935
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,640
this is institutional order for entry

936
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,440
drill where it just trades one little

937
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,700
bit above

938
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,920
this candle here this happens with all

939
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,960
time frames but the context is you have

940
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,760
to know where the market is likely to go

941
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,339
and because we have

942
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,380
this Gap here

943
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,760
and then we have this Gap here in close

944
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,859
proximity that's what makes this an

945
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,320
Institutional referential otherwise if

946
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
this wasn't here I would expect it to

947
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,520
trade more into this inefficiency I'll

948
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,680
have more of that in my books but that's

949
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,119
enough right here to send you light

950
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,680
years ahead everybody else so the market

951
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,859
does in fact trade below here completely

952
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,420
runs over top of this buy Center balance

953
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,780
also efficiency okay does it here and we

954
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,040
have another Gap

955
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,619
there we trade up into this and then

956
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,020
rips right through cell side here and

957
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
cell side there

958
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,800
so we're not looking at that as

959
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,740
buy is because it was a turning point in

960
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,060
the past for class and support

961
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,339
resistance idea theories

962
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,020
we're looking for it to trade through it

963
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,020
because there's liquidity below that

964
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,920
um

965
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,800
20 of the weekly range is here so all of

966
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,579
these things match in terms of

967
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,680
a draw on liquidity there's a reason to

968
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,300
anticipate it happening the Market's

969
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,220
been going straight up all week and then

970
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,960
now we're at the end of the week so this

971
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,940
is completely acceptable and reasonable

972
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,339
to see in price delivery and it's not to

973
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,720
say that we've called the top of the

974
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,220
marketplace because as I mentioned in

975
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,940
July 9th 2023's analysis I'm teaching

976
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,920
you not to try to pick tops and bottoms

977
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,480
on higher time frame charts because you

978
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,760
can hurt yourself doing that

979
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,680
just wait for the market to clearly show

980
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,320
you it's reversed and when it does just

981
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,420
keep working that bias that's you know

982
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,180
in the Market at the time and try not to

983
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,880
you know fancy dance it and try to

984
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,920
pick a top or bottom because you're not

985
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,960
going to get it correct you're not going

986
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,020
to do it so to avoid that just simply

987
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,320
try to stay on side and trade with a

988
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,940
expectation at the higher time frame

989
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,020
weekly chart

990
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,760
moving into a lower time frame daily

991
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,460
chart that's enough for you to find

992
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,740
Opportunities and not need to be picking

993
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,630
tops and bottoms

994
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,339
[Music]

995
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,560
okay here's a five minute chart and I'll

996
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,380
show you the inversion pure Vega that's

997
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,700
why the market went up to that level

998
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
here it went beyond the previous

999
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,619
15 minute

1000
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,520
right here see this Gap here this Gap

1001
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,740
we're looking through that to the left

1002
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,940
that's why we're not supplying demand

1003
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,820
folks sorry Sam's Iden

1004
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,460
this right here is a bison efficiency

1005
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,619
the market trades down through it

1006
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,119
now and you might look at this and say

1007
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,160
oh well this is this is now it's filled

1008
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,420
in we don't we don't worry about that

1009
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,940
that's why you're wrong

1010
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,460
because you're using flawed logic okay

1011
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,440
my algorithm is going to refer back to

1012
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,420
that candles high and that candle is low

1013
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,760
it will refer back to it again

1014
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,460
that's not support resistance okay it's

1015
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,660
algorithmic

1016
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,460
the market trades back up into it this

1017
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,200
is a small little in-ear in price action

1018
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,940
it's a mohawk it's a little nickname I

1019
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,680
gave it small little tiny little

1020
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,359
movement outside of it there's no body

1021
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,040
outside of it it's just the wick that's

1022
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,859
completely normal completely acceptable

1023
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,320
we don't worry about those things

1024
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
market shares it willingness to respect

1025
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,940
the inversion for everybody got and then

1026
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,320
breaks lower institutional overflow

1027
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,520
entry drill

1028
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,000
and then we have this Wick big wick here

1029
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,339
okay which doesn't do much in terms of

1030
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,160
damage below this low for sell side so

1031
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,380
once we move through it

1032
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,079
I like this Gap but I wanted to refer

1033
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,560
back to this Wick so does this Market

1034
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,780
respect that Wix consequent encroachment

1035
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,820
I don't know does it it's perfect isn't

1036
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,859
it look at these candles here the bodies

1037
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,800
tell you the story The Wicks they do the

1038
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,700
damage

1039
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,920
and this is telling you narrative it

1040
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,320
means the algorithm is in a Cell program

1041
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,020
it's going to seek sell side liquidity

1042
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,060
it's going to run on Cell stops it's

1043
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,220
going to run to inefficiencies well

1044
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,900
there's a smaller inefficiency remaining

1045
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,220
here

1046
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,260
it gets down to it there comes back up

1047
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,880
into a small Gap there

1048
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,160
and then does what Dives for the sell

1049
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,280
side and gets below the weekly TGIF 20

1050
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,980
of the weekly range

1051
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,099
I went short on here trading inside of

1052
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,920
the idea that we were in

1053
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,320
this inversion favorite you got

1054
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,460
there

1055
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,500
I took a little bit of heat on it but

1056
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,260
not much and then aggressively ran for

1057
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,119
the south side and there you go so

1058
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,740
that's why I used to teach my son on

1059
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,579
Friday afternoon

1060
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,839
notice where we closed

1061
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,880
look at this

1062
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,339
real close to the 20 percent

1063
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,140
again you don't find that in your books

1064
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,760
okay

1065
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
there are so many things that people

1066
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,160
will look at whether it be me or other

1067
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,540
people

1068
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,740
and

1069
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,960
because we're looking at the same four

1070
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,940
things open high low and close

1071
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,980
we're forced to use geometric shapes

1072
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,800
okay we're forced to use trend lines and

1073
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,859
things to articulate you know an idea

1074
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,200
with a audience member or for our own

1075
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,420
journaling and when we make these things

1076
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,460
available to other people invariably

1077
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,320
they're gonna see oh well you know

1078
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,240
you're doing the Classic this and the

1079
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,560
classic that I'm not doing anything

1080
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,180
that's classic I'm making the new

1081
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,820
Classics okay I'm making the new

1082
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,320
uh

1083
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,079
future reference books okay everything

1084
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,460
that you're learning here live you're in

1085
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,740
that Gan moment okay you're in that

1086
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,500
Livermore moment you're having someone

1087
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,940
teach you something that no one's had

1088
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,339
their fingerprints on before

1089
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:23,160
and I say these things not to be

1090
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,420
arrogant I'm not trying to be

1091
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,280
condescending to anybody and I'm not

1092
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,320
saying to hear myself talk

1093
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,060
but I want you to appreciate the fact

1094
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,160
that what you're being exposed to you're

1095
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,200
not entitled to it

1096
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,800
you're not entitled to know these things

1097
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,839
so when I see other people claim they

1098
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,880
know it claim they've been doing it

1099
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,220
before me they have no

1100
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,099
experience doing it they have no track

1101
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,839
record with it they can't even go out

1102
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,220
and do executions to prove they don't

1103
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,420
even know how to do it right now let

1104
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,599
alone say they did it before me

1105
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,859
so

1106
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,359
I want you to think about what you

1107
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,339
watched happen last week

1108
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,400
how explosive the market moved exactly

1109
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,099
how I outlined it last Sunday before the

1110
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,420
market opened up you had it in your hot

1111
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,619
little hands

1112
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,119
what do you think

1113
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,160
your trading would be like

1114
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,740
two years from now learning this what do

1115
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,760
you think of Trades would be like 10

1116
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,260
years from now

1117
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,520
what do you think your trading is going

1118
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,119
to be like three decades like mine today

1119
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,280
my understanding of the marketplace

1120
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,380
is rooted on things that I've codified

1121
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,140
in 1996. so the things I'm talking about

1122
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,480
and teaching I author these things

1123
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,579
no one taught me these things no one

1124
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,560
mentored me no one sat down and said

1125
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,540
here here's my mentorship join this and

1126
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,040
I'm going to teach you that it wasn't in

1127
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,020
any of the books it wasn't in any of the

1128
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,560
things I bought

1129
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,040
and it's not easy I know it's not easy

1130
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,720
you're learning it from the person that

1131
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,520
created it

1132
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,740
and it's a struggle sometimes for you to

1133
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,820
learn

1134
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,460
and it's not because I'm not that good

1135
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,560
at teaching it's just this is a very

1136
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,839
dense topic

1137
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,020
it's very very very dense it's it

1138
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,180
requires a lot of study it requires a

1139
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,920
lot of case studies where you go back

1140
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,780
and look at old moves and you study it

1141
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,700
and you listen to the boring stuff I

1142
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,200
talk about whether it be in a Twitter

1143
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,780
space or whether it be in these parts of

1144
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,160
the video where no one really likes to

1145
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,420
listen to it

1146
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,920
but you're not going to learn it without

1147
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,720
having these things and that's what

1148
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,099
mentorship is

1149
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,359
if you want to sit down and learn

1150
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,500
something from somebody that knows

1151
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,960
something very well

1152
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,579
and if they really want to teach you

1153
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,260
they're not going to rush through the

1154
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,819
topic they want to make sure that they

1155
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,319
get into all the nooks and crannies they

1156
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,599
want to get down to the small little

1157
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,339
things that they're going to creep in

1158
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,079
and mess you up because you're going to

1159
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,700
make a big mountain out of something

1160
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,619
that's not that significant

1161
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,180
now I know what those things are going

1162
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,500
to be so that's the reason why I talk to

1163
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,060
you about these things

1164
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,640
don't focus on that focus on this do

1165
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,619
this don't do that

1166
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:54,180
and for the folks that want to speed

1167
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,520
through it and try to do you know an

1168
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,619
abbreviated mentorship you're the one

1169
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,720
that is going to fail

1170
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,819
and I have a lot of failures because

1171
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,700
they rushed through it

1172
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,920
not because the content doesn't work or

1173
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,140
the concepts don't work or I can't teach

1174
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,680
it properly

1175
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,720
but there's going to be a huge learning

1176
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,599
curve for some of you and others you'll

1177
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,460
pick it up faster than someone else

1178
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,260
might

1179
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,900
it's just a matter of personal

1180
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,339
experience and each one of you are going

1181
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:27,359
to have a

1182
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,240
a duration that is unique to you and you

1183
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
have to submit to that I'm a practical

1184
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,099
person I know that not all of you are

1185
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,300
going to be able to

1186
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,220
resonate with me I'm not going to

1187
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,440
scratch the itch as a mentor for all of

1188
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,260
you and you're going to want to chase

1189
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,020
something else I promise you folks I

1190
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,839
promise you I swear to you that there is

1191
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,300
not one single person on YouTube or

1192
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,099
anywhere else that's going to teach you

1193
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,200
like I'm teaching you

1194
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,060
I promise you that

1195
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,040
they're just familiar with what I've

1196
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,260
already shared thus far

1197
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,540
so there's nothing wrong with looking at

1198
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,800
other people's

1199
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,079
level of understanding and that's what

1200
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,400
they're doing they're showing you their

1201
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,020
level of understanding but they're not

1202
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,819
in a position of authority to be able to

1203
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:12,960
teach it because they don't even know

1204
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,160
what they're teaching

1205
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,619
they're just familiar with it

1206
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,260
it's just like when you first

1207
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,240
got a driver's license

1208
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,359
and you handed or your parents handed

1209
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,280
the keys to you and you get in and you

1210
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,300
start it up just because you got your

1211
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,500
driver's license doesn't mean you

1212
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,720
understand exactly how that car is

1213
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,300
designed what causes the ignition what

1214
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,339
causes the you know the the engine to

1215
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,319
stay running what's all the connections

1216
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,660
that causes all of these instruments to

1217
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,220
work like they do

1218
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,780
you probably didn't do much thinking in

1219
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,800
terms of that you just couldn't wait to

1220
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,300
get behind the wheel and that's what

1221
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,400
these mentors and that's what you many

1222
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,220
times as a would-be student is like

1223
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,380
you want to rush out there and just get

1224
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,780
your hands dirty with it and sometimes

1225
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,079
it ain't dirt it's blood you lose a few

1226
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,760
fingers maybe more because you're

1227
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,280
rushing in before you're ready and

1228
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,420
you're learning from people that don't

1229
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,920
know what they're doing

1230
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,200
it's easy to talk about in hindsight

1231
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,000
it's easy to use what I'm talking about

1232
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,079
in real time analysis and then borrow my

1233
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,240
Viewpoint in the marketplace and then

1234
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,740
come out and say you know look at my

1235
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,079
look at my students that pass their

1236
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,880
evaluations when if I wouldn't have said

1237
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,200
anything

1238
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,240
you would have had no voice

1239
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,560
and your students wouldn't be doing

1240
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,800
anything

1241
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,300
so

1242
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,099
I'm going to leave that with you

1243
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,599
and

1244
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,660
remind you that these things aren't

1245
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,720
Cherry Picked these things are not

1246
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,099
coincidence they happen every single

1247
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,859
week and sometimes there are certain

1248
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,099
parameters that are met that allow for

1249
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,260
explosive runs

1250
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,660
what took place

1251
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,660
what took place this week

1252
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,440
think about it

1253
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,020
what's occurring on the daily chart

1254
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,420
Fairbank app

1255
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,339
boom third week of what

1256
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,960
third week of what June

1257
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,640
just like that seasonal tendency calls

1258
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,480
for

1259
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,839
folks those things are like road maps

1260
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,640
and we knew in May

1261
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,200
when the seasonal fantasy that I like to

1262
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,480
see where if it sells off if I can find

1263
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,920
something technical that aligns with the

1264
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,079
market to see it Go lower

1265
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,119
if it's not providing that that means we

1266
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,420
are really bullish

1267
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,780
SCP went up over 400 handles

1268
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,180
look at the NASDAQ

1269
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,660
almost a thousand or more

1270
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,060
from this turning point right there

1271
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,980
and then rips again in July this move

1272
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,500
right here this is a classic

1273
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,540
in the summer months that part is that

1274
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,079
That's a classic scenario

1275
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,420
if you're in a bull market this is what

1276
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,819
you expect in the months of June and May

1277
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,200
if

1278
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,720
we're in a bearish market a sell-off in

1279
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,319
May into June they're very very good

1280
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,940
that's how you use these Alternatives

1281
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,680
the ID or a premise behind a seasonal

1282
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,599
tendency that is failing

1283
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,099
and being

1284
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,619
instrumental to having a market go

1285
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,480
explosive you know in the opposite

1286
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,800
direction to what the seasonal tendency

1287
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,300
would imply

1288
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,520
I learned that from Larry Williams

1289
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,099
and I learned that in 1995

1290
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:45,119
from his four VHS tape I mentioned many

1291
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,579
times over the years as uh

1292
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,040
as a resource that I learned from and

1293
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,680
it's a I believe it's titled the future

1294
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,560
millionaires confidential trading course

1295
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,880
and he talked about seasonal tendencies

1296
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,619
in here he talked about how he was the

1297
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,000
first one to write a book about seasonal

1298
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,220
Tendencies and

1299
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,319
we talked about Jake Bernstein who I'm

1300
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,140
not a fan of I I never liked his work

1301
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,240
even though Larry himself respected him

1302
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,839
I didn't I didn't find anything of value

1303
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,720
from him okay and I'm sure there were

1304
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,119
people that found you know usefulness

1305
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,980
from whatever he put out I just

1306
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,440
personally wasn't able to do that but in

1307
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,079
terms of seasonal Tendencies the idea of

1308
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,780
winning seasonal tendency is failing to

1309
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,300
manifest itself that

1310
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,880
is many times not always but many times

1311
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,000
it is conducive for an explosive price

1312
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,920
run in the opposite direction to what

1313
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,960
you would expect in the season of energy

1314
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,020
so it's because we had the the

1315
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,500
potential to sell off in May

1316
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,160
didn't form it did not form at that time

1317
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,180
so that gives more rocket fuel for the

1318
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,040
June

1319
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,160
loaded forms and that's classic

1320
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,319
in stock index futures

1321
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,660
so as a swing I'm saying all this stuff

1322
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,859
to you because I know some of you that

1323
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,960
don't want to day trade you can't do it

1324
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,640
you don't want to do it doesn't fit your

1325
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,800
your personality and I understand that

1326
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,240
but what I'm showing you here on this

1327
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,500
daily chart how's that any different

1328
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,760
from what I'm teaching you on a

1329
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,500
one-minute chart four minute chart five

1330
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,359
minute chart 15 minute chart hourly

1331
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:19,440
chart

1332
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,880
it's nothing different except for the

1333
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,300
time frame

1334
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,619
isn't this

1335
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,000
something that we would be looking to

1336
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,839
get along on anyway if we're bolus yes

1337
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,119
what is this here high and that high

1338
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,040
that's relative equal highs that means

1339
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,260
what there's buy side above that we're

1340
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,520
not looking at that as going back out

1341
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,099
through this here as resistance

1342
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,560
we're looking for it to trade through it

1343
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,180
it doesn't sound like resistance to you

1344
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,740
what kind of resistance would that be

1345
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,819
if you thought that this was a

1346
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,619
resistance level these relative equal

1347
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,680
highs you thought that same idea was the

1348
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,180
same thing you would hope your roof on

1349
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,280
your home is like would you want a roof

1350
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,559
that performs like this

1351
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,940
no

1352
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,180
so I attack and I teach my students to

1353
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,700
attack by side liquidity above a single

1354
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,260
or relative equal High

1355
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,900
I teach my students to attack

1356
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,480
a single low or relative equal lows

1357
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,760
where their cell side below it to it and

1358
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,319
through it

1359
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:22,079
that's what we teach here okay we do not

1360
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,660
teach some garbage resistance and

1361
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,140
support idea that is so ambiguous you

1362
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,660
have no idea that there's never been a

1363
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,160
book I'm telling you right now I have

1364
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,980
over 2 000 books and there has never

1365
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,500
been an author educator teacher that has

1366
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,020
ever codified a single approach that

1367
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,579
goes in and finds the right support and

1368
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,020
resistance

1369
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,660
it's not there folks

1370
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,460
that's a religion

1371
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,619
that's what it is it's a religion okay

1372
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,960
they say we're cult the idea of support

1373
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,640
and resistance you have to have more

1374
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,740
faith in that than simply understanding

1375
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,059
that what I'm teaching here is the real

1376
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,140
Market

1377
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,079
because it's subjective

1378
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,780
no matter where you are in the world if

1379
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,579
you're pulling up the NASDAQ daily chart

1380
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:08,280
you're going to see this Gap

1381
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,319
okay it's a fair value Gap in the form

1382
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:11,220
of a buy Center balance outside

1383
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,380
efficiency that does not hide from you

1384
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,720
there's not other ones in this area that

1385
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,180
you might get tricked by

1386
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,280
but the idea of picking a support

1387
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,319
resistance idea based on classic support

1388
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,300
and resistance Theory what high are you

1389
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,440
going to use what low are you going to

1390
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,579
use what

1391
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,980
what diagonal trend lines are you going

1392
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,020
to draw to and which one's going to be

1393
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,480
correct see I've wasted lots of money

1394
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,140
doing that though and so have you other

1395
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,240
people that have traded before I was

1396
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,160
even born wasted and lost lots of money

1397
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,480
doing that stuff too but hey it looks

1398
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,800
great in the books

1399
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,800
it looks great in hindsight look at this

1400
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,720
level here this diagonal support this

1401
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,000
diagonal resistance and I went in and I

1402
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,920
created a concept that attacks that idea

1403
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,740
that entire premise I tack it

1404
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,740
that's my Phantom trend line

1405
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,740
it's a specific approach to

1406
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,619
going after retail thought processes

1407
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,140
about that very idea

1408
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,839
I've taken retail and turned it upside

1409
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,300
down and I've made it useful to anyone

1410
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,220
that simply wants to look at it

1411
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,980
investigate the ideas and see if whether

1412
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,359
or not I'm telling you the truth and if

1413
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,099
you go into charts I promise you you're

1414
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,780
going to find that truth in that proof

1415
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,380
there's so many people there are

1416
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,819
students of mine now there's so many

1417
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,520
students of mine that used to be

1418
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,420
detractors doubters in the beginning

1419
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,640
they want to go in and prove that what I

1420
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,319
was saying wasn't the case

1421
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,280
and now they're long-term you know loyal

1422
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,020
students they know what they have

1423
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,059
learned from me is the truth

1424
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,980
and you're seeing that you just saw it

1425
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,819
again

1426
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,160
how can you cherry pick the entire

1427
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,079
weekly range how can you cherry pick the

1428
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,020
entire weekly delivery of not just one

1429
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,300
market but four

1430
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,700
I gave you 4X I gave you the dollar

1431
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,619
Index and I gave you the ES

1432
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,559
it delivered

1433
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,140
like gangbusters

1434
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,780
and you should be excited about that not

1435
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,000
hopped up on goofballs but you should be

1436
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,980
inspired by thinking well you know this

1437
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,079
is this is really encouraging for me I

1438
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,119
now I have something to to go on because

1439
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,000
everybody that watched that video

1440
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,359
on July 9th of 2023 that analysis video

1441
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,280
the commentary that I gave in terms of

1442
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,140
you know what I felt the Mark was going

1443
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,819
to do this week it's on YouTube it's

1444
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:31,740
it's available to everyone you didn't

1445
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,720
have to pay for it you don't have to do

1446
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,859
any kind of subscriptions you have to

1447
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:36,240
send me no money through PayPal you

1448
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,440
ain't got to do any kind of crypto

1449
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,599
payments which I wouldn't take anyway

1450
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,400
all you have to do is watch the videos

1451
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,900
take notes

1452
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,180
and share your experience with me that's

1453
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,240
it it's free folks

1454
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,339
and there's people out there that simply

1455
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:52,319
want to keep you from learning how to do

1456
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,339
this

1457
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:55,319
and the more closer we get to November

1458
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,119
it's going to increase

1459
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,339
because nothing else you're going to

1460
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,500
learn can compete with this

1461
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,640
nothing I promise you I promise you

1462
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,240
there is nothing like this

1463
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,040
because this is the truth behind the

1464
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,559
marketplace this is exactly why markets

1465
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,839
go up and down it has nothing to do with

1466
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,400
the depth of Market it has nothing to do

1467
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,079
with Market profile it has nothing to do

1468
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:20,579
with supply and demand has nothing to do

1469
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:21,900
with Elliott weave has nothing to do

1470
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,520
with harmonic patterns none of that

1471
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,780
stuff

1472
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,300
is what causes markets going up and down

1473
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,619
that's not there's no such thing as

1474
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,540
buying and selling pressure

1475
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,220
there's buying and selling going on I'm

1476
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,839
not arguing that

1477
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,819
but when the market goes

1478
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:37,920
it's going to a very specific level and

1479
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,980
I'm teaching you what they are

1480
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,660
I'm telling you when they're going to do

1481
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,740
it

1482
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,740
there has never been a phenomenon like

1483
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,339
what you're experiencing right now

1484
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:52,619
and I'm honored

1485
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,079
I'm very honored

1486
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,079
to be sitting at this Helm with you as

1487
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,339
your mentor

1488
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,059
at a point where I have 771

1489
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,579
000 students on this YouTube channel now

1490
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,980
that to me is

1491
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,700
Bonkers it's it's crazy that there's

1492
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,800
that many people

1493
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,960
wanting to sit down and listen to a guy

1494
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,839
from Middle River Maryland

1495
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,720
so I'm definitely blessed the Lord has

1496
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,700
definitely made me the head not the tail

1497
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,800
and I'm greatly appreciative of all of

1498
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,680
you that want to sit down and spend time

1499
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,059
until talk to you next time
