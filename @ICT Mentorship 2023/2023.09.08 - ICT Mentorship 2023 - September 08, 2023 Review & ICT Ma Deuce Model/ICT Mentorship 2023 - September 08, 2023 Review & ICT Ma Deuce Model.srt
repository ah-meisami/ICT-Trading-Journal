1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
welcome back folks going to do a quick

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,119
little review here and I'll squeeze in

3
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
another approach to using some PD arrays

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
I've already taught and how we can kind

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,040
of like build a model around it that'll

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,440
come at the end of the video here for

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,040
now let's take a quick look at the

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,120
higher time frame on the US dollar

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,920
Index last time we talked I mentioned

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,280
that we would be looking

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,359
for potential run up into

12
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,719
here this was the bide liquidity pool I

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,000
mentioned we were driving up into that

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,359
we've seen that and then the later time

15
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,000
we might see this actually happen it did

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,319
we stayed bullish we haven't been

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,439
looking for lower prices on dollar uh

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,960
there's a small little volume imbalance

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,479
right in there watch that going into

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,479
next week and then obviously the buy

21
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,240
side resides here so a really strong run

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,360
below these relative equal

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
lows sell side liquidity taken fair

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,759
value Gap traded up and continuously

25
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,280
moved into the B that we had here here

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,920
and here longer term we have this so

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,880
dollar showing its underlying strength

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
and it's still going to put interterm

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
long-term pressure on euro dollar

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
wanting

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
to go lower and pound dollar wanting to

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,960
go

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,520
lower speaking of Euro here is the daily

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,880
chart for euro dollar and I mentioned

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
the inversion fair value

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Gap we trade up into that look at the

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,240
bodies again again respecting consequent

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,119
inion which is the midpoint of any

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,039
Gap Market broke lower taking the cell

40
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,639
side out here then we moved aggressively

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,280
in this direction towards the cell side

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,200
throughout the entirety of this week it

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
would have been nice to see this trade

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,400
up into this small little Gap here I was

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,319
kind of looking for that

46
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,120
today but the failure to get up there is

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,640
you know it's indicative of heaviness

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,239
heaviness meaning that the Market's

49
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,319
likely to

50
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,720
lower and again attack that cell sign so

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,319
with higher dollar prices we're going to

52
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,120
stick with the idea of looking for lower

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,720
prices for fiber and fiber is just the

54
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,879
nickname for euro

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,360
dollar okay cable or pound dollar see we

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,239
have

57
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
a inversion fair value Gap here the

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Market's been breaking

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,840
lower next draw liquidity Still Remains

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,560
at the sell side liquidity here

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,680
this one we traded up into this small

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
little fair value Gap there you can look

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,239
at your lower time frames we trade up

64
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,959
into that this is institutional Oro

65
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
entry drill where it goes into a

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
partial but less than half of a fair

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,280
value Gap there and then sells off so

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,360
we'll be looking for near term we

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
have sell side resting below here and we

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,480
have the cell side below here so we're

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
maintaining a bearish stands still for

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,760
British pound so if you guys appreciate

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,599
or like these longer term you know bias

74
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,959
based ideas for Forex I'm not going to

75
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
be drawing your attention to the smaller

76
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,400
time frames because I don't think that

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,640
it is something that we should be doing

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
right now it's something for you to do

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,879
or your own analysis but from the higher

80
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,000
time frame I'm just lending my

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
experience to give you the bias and you

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
can see pretty much it's been delivering

83
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
like Gang Busters so uh if you like that

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,599
kind of stuff you want me continue just

85
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,239
give this video a thumbs

86
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
up em Min S&P futures contract September

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,879
delivery daily

88
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,200
chart and we just fell short yesterday

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,759
going into this discount fair value Gap

90
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,560
to just got really really close but not

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,600
quite getting into it we have this buy

92
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,840
side and balance sell sign efficiency

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
between this candle's low and this

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,720
candle's High that's the blue lines here

95
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,199
that's denoting that buy side balance s

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,240
sign efficiency and this red line is

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,039
consequent encouragement or midpoint

98
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,199
between this candle's low this candle's

99
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,600
high so all this big movement up here

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,759
it's buy side and

101
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,880
balance sell side inefficiency so it

102
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,639
needs to see what lower price is

103
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,759
delivered we seen that happen here and

104
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,560
this price movement here is is in my

105
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,160
opinion what we're having to deal with

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
on the lower time frame so if you

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,520
watched how we traded on Wednesday

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,479
Thursday and Friday of this week for

109
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,440
index

110
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
Futures unless you were Ultra shortterm

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
like one minute scalping five minute

112
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,000
scalping um You probably experience a

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,680
lot of difficulty in terms of navigating

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,960
you know the EB and flow of intraday

115
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,319
price action so whenever we have these

116
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,560
kind of

117
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,919
like bookends think of it like that okay

118
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,280
we have strong opinion ated reasons that

119
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,199
we can make the case for higher prices

120
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,960
and for lower prices and when we have

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,520
that everything

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,400
makes trading with a great deal of

123
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,120
precision that would otherwise be

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
apparent in all time

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
frames it kind of reduces it down to a

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
very

127
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,319
infrequent well at least you may observe

128
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
that it will be

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,039
infrequent we've seen that Wednesday

130
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,720
Thursday and Friday not the latter part

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,080
of Wednesday not the first part of

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,759
Wednesday but the afternoon of Wednesday

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,800
Thursday and then Friday's

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,280
trading we're seeing all that in here

135
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,240
so it's going to have to move outside of

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
this

137
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,000
range definitively for me so in other

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
words it's got to either trade above the

139
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,319
buy side B sell sign efficiency is high

140
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,000
or it's got a trade below the buy side

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,240
and balance sell sign efficienc is low

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
why while we're in here I will not be

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
interested in taking any trades for em

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,639
mini

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,639
S&P this area here is a fair value Gap

146
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,479
from this candle's low this candle's

147
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,759
High the Shaded area is denoting

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,080
that on the hourly chart you can see how

149
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
we had Fairway Gap here institutional

150
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,800
entry drill which is a partial entry but

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,240
just falling short of half the Gap

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,039
breaks down one more in time does the

153
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,240
same thing here look at all this range

154
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
bound trading right in there see that

155
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,560
then we break lower small little range

156
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,680
break lower small little range and this

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
placement to the downside trading to the

158
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
low of the inefficiency or the bide Bal

159
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,639
sside efficiency on the daily chart

160
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,479
remember the blue lines denote

161
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,080
that big singular up Clos candle and

162
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,120
then the red level is the midpoint of

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,560
that and that shaded area is the fair

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,879
value gap on the daily chart we Tri up

165
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,800
to consequent encroachment here roll

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,280
over and just fell short of trading into

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
that inefficiency on the daily chart and

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,360
sweeping below this low so it fell

169
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,240
just short of reaching into that and

170
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,520
then we had this gnarly Thursday and

171
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,840
Friday a trading range for E Min S&P

172
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
returning back to consequent

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,199
encroachment 15 minut time frame again

174
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,120
you can see how we had Friday's trading

175
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,159
Thursday's trading in the afternoon

176
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,639
retracing back up into consequent

177
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,639
encouragement so a really nice sell off

178
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,199
here in the morning which was really

179
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,440
easy to see

180
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,919
that follow this price action here this

181
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,520
right here you have to be extremely

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
Nimble and know exactly what you're

183
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
looking for if you can get it take it

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,280
and stop otherwise you can get chopped

185
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,879
up in here over trade or do a lot of

186
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
things so otherwise undermine your

187
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
growth or create draw down for your

188
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,520
account so these are problematic areas

189
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,719
until we leave this range I'm not

190
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,440
interested in touching it so if we stay

191
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,399
within this when we open on Sunday and

192
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,200
trade into it on Monday my hands will be

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,958
away from all asset classes because my

194
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,880
only interest right now in trading is

195
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,800
the index Futures S&P and

196
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,320
NASDAQ NASDAQ daily chart similar vein

197
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,399
we have depos balance sell efficiency

198
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,760
defined by this candle's high this

199
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
candle's low midpoint is consequent

200
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,279
encouragement

201
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,880
and price will have to

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,680
leave this buy B sell efficiency either

203
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
higher or lower before I'm interested in

204
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
trading because we had this run

205
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,399
up I like the idea of potentially

206
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,959
trading down to

207
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,880
15126 and a half I mean that that's what

208
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm interested in seeing I want to see

209
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,320
that happen because we've seen it happen

210
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
for

211
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
ES the run up we seen imp partial uh

212
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,519
decline which we'll look at that and I

213
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,399
called that level real time before it

214
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,040
actually is delivered on Thursday on

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,920
Twitter or we could rally higher and

216
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
come back out of this buy side and bance

217
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,959
out efficiency and then resume going

218
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,480
higher and reach for the buy side here

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
and completely close in this

220
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,880
inefficiency over here in the form of a

221
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,640
CBI so because the analysis is

222
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
conflicted meaning that we could range

223
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Bound in here for a little while and

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,800
still deliver to that 15,26 A5

225
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
that's what I'm kind of expecting to

226
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,079
happen but I'm not excited about taking

227
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,160
any trades in here until we definitively

228
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
leave this buy sign balance sell sign

229
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,560
efficiency the reason why is because

230
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
even though I like the idea of going

231
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,800
short I could be wrong and it may be

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,240
just accumulating in here to go higher

233
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,160
because this Market stock market is

234
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,640
absolutely rigged okay I mean more more

235
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,160
than it really is okay and other time uh

236
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,720
they're propping this market up for

237
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,760
political reasons uh there's no reason

238
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,399
for and there's no justification for the

239
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,200
shares being at the levels they are for

240
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,959
stocks right now it's just it's not

241
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,760
warranted at all so because we're seeing

242
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,040
conflicted both sides of the narrative

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
on the higher time frame that forces

244
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,800
your hand to be a intraday scalper you

245
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,399
know short-term trading swing trading

246
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,200
you have to be very very precise you you

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,440
get really one entry and that's it so in

248
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,800
a very small one minute time frame

249
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,639
you'll have a little bit more

250
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,639
opportunities to navigate but you have

251
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,240
to have experience and be nimble so I'm

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
just showing you my cards I'm not

253
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
terribly excited about going into next

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
week until we leave this B B cell

255
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,360
efficiency on the hourly chart you can

256
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,760
see we ran buy side here into a bearish

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
order block we broke

258
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
down bearish order block here

259
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
displacement to the downside swept the

260
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
cell side here entered the buy side and

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
balance cell

262
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
efficiency rolled over after

263
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
institutional order entry drill here

264
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,760
which is just a partial entry into this

265
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,399
Cy I try to keep the charts clean that

266
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,440
way I have less to talk about get

267
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
through this chart discussion quicker

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,279
for you this

269
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,000
evening we rolled through went through

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,720
half of the daily buy sign and bance

271
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,959
cell side efficiency which is the

272
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,320
consequent encouragement level that blue

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,040
line which is just midpoint between the

274
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,120
lower level and the higher level of the

275
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
daily buy sign and balance sell sign

276
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,279
efficiency that One Singular big green

277
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,839
Candle on the daily chart that's the

278
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,079
reference points here for it on the

279
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,680
hourly chart so we rolled over and I

280
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,720
gave on

281
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,519
Twitter on Thursday I said to have 15,1

282
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,720
85.2 and

283
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,000
15,17 noted on your chart and we went

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,279
down the bodies respected both of those

285
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,440
levels we Wicked through both of

286
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,800
them 15175 is this candle here so

287
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
there's a buy sign B sell sign

288
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
efficiency between this candle's low

289
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,519
this candle's high with this one big

290
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,320
candle so that's where that

291
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,399
15, 175 level came from the 15, 1885 and

292
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,360
a quarter level which is here is the

293
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,519
daily buy s balance sell s efficiency

294
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,959
25% quadrant okay so in other words if

295
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,440
you take this level here and this level

296
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,360
here and divide it in equal parts four

297
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
equal parts half is here here so halfway

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,040
between this level and here is this so

299
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,399
it's the lower quadrant 25% level of

300
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,120
here this is that's not quarters Theory

301
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,880
by the way right away I know some think

302
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,040
oh he's teaching quarters Theory it's

303
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,880
not quarters Theory I'm looking at an

304
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,120
inefficiency and I'm grading that just

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
like I teach how to grade a price swing

306
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,399
in my core content so these are all

307
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,040
algorithmic signatures that price will

308
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
respect and adhere to so it's important

309
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,440
to know what they are and how apply it

310
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,079
to your charts and then anticipate these

311
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,920
types of responses Market rallies off of

312
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,000
that on Thursday comes back in and ret

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
trades back to the consequent

314
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
encroachment midpoint and then sends us

315
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,480
back up to the high end of the daily b

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,279
side of Mel so efficiency

317
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,320
high on the 15-minute time frame you can

318
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,519
see how again on Friday and on Thursday

319
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,480
just a really gnarly trading range I

320
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,519
mean you

321
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,360
can grow very frustrated trying to trade

322
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,199
this if you're 10 trying to anticipate a

323
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,320
follow through either higher or lower

324
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,759
you have to be very very Nimble and look

325
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,199
at the lower time frames pick your shots

326
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,199
if you get a winter stop for the day or

327
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,720
the session and be done and try not to

328
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,519
force your hand too

329
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
much all right see here's the one minute

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Candlestick chart for the NASDAQ and I'm

331
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,720
going to teach you something that

332
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,639
employs my inversion fair value got now

333
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,880
before I get into this there's a a

334
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,079
couple points I want to make because

335
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,120
there are a couple Romper Room mentors

336
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,320
out there that will tell you that a fair

337
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,279
value Gap is something that is simply a

338
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,639
support or resistance level on a lower

339
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
time frame that's not true that's not

340
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,959
what it is it's an actual

341
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,839
inefficiency this little area in here

342
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,959
where one single candle pass up to the

343
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,079
upside that's a bide and B cide

344
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,120
efficiency so it's not had any

345
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,720
overlapping with any other candles after

346
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,000
it formed on the downside so it's

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,480
lacking what sells side delivery

348
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,000
so it's part of this swing

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
low part of an expected

350
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,440
redelivery between the high of the daily

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,480
buy sign cell sign efficiency which is

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,199
this level up here and the low of that

353
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,839
same daily B Bal and cell efficiency

354
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,279
okay so if we are up in the upper

355
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,880
portion of that range because here's the

356
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
consequent cment between this level and

357
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,720
this level and we're seeing the market

358
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,480
start to break down it's doing here this

359
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
inversion fair value got this is part of

360
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,880
what many of you ask how do you know

361
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,240
which fair value Gap is going to be an

362
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
inversion fair value Gap how do you know

363
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,480
which fair value Gap to use I'm

364
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
employing a lot of different things time

365
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,680
and price I'm using institutional Market

366
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
structure not your classic higher high

367
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,319
lower low crap because that's that's

368
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,600
infancy that's it's to myopic you need

369
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,839
to know what you're looking

370
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,440
for in the grand scheme of things price

371
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
was already working its way down into

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,440
and towards this redelivery on the buy

373
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,040
side and balance s sign efficiency low

374
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,959
that's this price level down here so if

375
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,880
we are looking at this price leg running

376
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,639
higher with the expectation that we're

377
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,839
going to see it roll over this becoming

378
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
a fulc chome Point high to low project

379
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,199
it down that gives us a reasonable

380
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,000
expectation to see it reach into a

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,480
discount range which would be half of

382
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,240
the range between this high and that low

383
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,399
which makes the daily buy side and

384
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,680
balance soide efficiency if your first

385
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
time watching this I already said enough

386
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
to completely confuse you but I promise

387
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,120
you if you take a few times to watch

388
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
this video the only thing I'm stating is

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,920
all of this price run here going down is

390
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,040
just simply trying to get down to this

391
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,399
level here because it was One Singular

392
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,360
Candle on the daily chart that went up

393
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,920
so the market will efficiently deliver

394
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,360
sside delivery which is not sell-side

395
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
liquidity sside delivery is just the

396
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,519
market goes lower it books price on the

397
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,600
downside in other words it's offering

398
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,799
price between the Range High of the

399
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
daily buy sign B sell sign efficiency at

400
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,720
15361 A5 and the low of that daily

401
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,079
Candle by balance efficiency at 15,26 A5

402
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,199
so the only thing I'm stating here is if

403
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,160
we were to take that range which is the

404
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,880
daily candle and I I'll explain again

405
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,119
what what I'm showing you here on the

406
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,320
daily chart but for now conceptually

407
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,480
just imagine if half of the range from

408
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
that price level here and that price

409
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,679
level here half of that range is here

410
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,280
anything at that price level or higher

411
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,400
is a premium if we're bearish we really

412
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
want to be selling short up here with

413
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,799
the expectation that it's going to aim

414
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,640
for something down in the lower half and

415
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,480
ultimately perfectly delivered to this

416
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,520
lower level 15,26 A5 it need not do that

417
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,799
so what levels are we looking for

418
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,840
because we're not dealing with zones

419
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
well what's the the lower quadrant lower

420
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,600
quadrant price level is here 15,1 185

421
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,360
and a

422
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,240
qu half of the range on the buyid B sell

423
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,679
sign efficiency on the daily chart which

424
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,320
is this high and that low that's in

425
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,400
purple half of it's here half of the

426
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,039
half point and the low is the lower

427
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,159
quadrant point so that's why I was

428
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,400
saying on Thursday to have these levels

429
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,520
noted and then you have the Tuesday

430
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
August 29th 2023 10: a.m. 1 hour High

431
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,440
sign balance C sign efficiency low and I

432
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
already mentioned that before we drop

433
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
down the lower time frames so everything

434
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm saying here I've literally pointed

435
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,400
to and referred to what it is in this

436
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,480
very video so you don't have to go

437
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
anywhere else searching for anything

438
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,400
it's just a matter of listening to what

439
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,120
I'm saying here and then finding it in

440
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,039
the chart and also following along in

441
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,720
the narrative as why am interested in

442
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,880
this very fair value Gap at all because

443
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,440
we're in a premium I'm expected this to

444
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,159
see this price leg roll over it already

445
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,679
broke below it

446
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,400
here so it rolls through I'm not

447
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
interested in selling short

448
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,880
there because I know that time is a

449
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,760
bigger Factor so when price is running

450
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
up like this I'm not trying to chase

451
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,320
that I'm not trying to be a um an

452
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,400
early participant I want to see price

453
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
get to

454
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
8:00 8 clock is here so the market

455
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,960
trades back down through it again we're

456
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,919
not supply and demand so every time you

457
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,280
see a little rectangle here the nefy the

458
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,159
first the first- time viewer or someone

459
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,280
just has a a super superiority complex

460
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,600
they'll say that I'm teaching supply and

461
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
demand it's absolutely not because I'm

462
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
looking through all of this to go right

463
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
back to that specific candle right there

464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,480
and its specific price

465
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,880
levels it trades up to a here now

466
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
because of time I'm expecting it to have

467
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,159
a better influence over price does it

468
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,080
send price lower yes one more time it

469
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,799
comes back up and hits it again does it

470
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,440
go through it again no it's stopping

471
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,760
because it's referring right back to

472
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
that price point right there so if this

473
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,440
is a fair value Gap and I was bullish

474
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,919
I'd be interested in buying it when it

475
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,280
was going down into it here or if it

476
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,080
went down through it and it came back

477
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,880
above it now I would treat it as you

478
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,200
know a reclaimed discount

479
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,679
array I'm looking through these

480
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,799
candlesticks

481
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,000
to a specific PD array but I'm applying

482
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
narrative which is a very hard thing to

483
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,440
teach because it's learned conceptually

484
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,320
by experience seeing over and over and

485
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,400
over again that's why I'm trying to tell

486
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,640
you that what some of you are asking for

487
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,200
is a one shot one kill video where it

488
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,799
literally answers all your questions in

489
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,400
one visit one sitting one View and it's

490
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,240
it nothing is like that okay but uh this

491
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
approach to using an inversion fair

492
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,039
value Gap because otherwise it would be

493
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
bullish here it's not because we're in a

494
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
premium

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,480
I want to be short I want to be looking

496
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,559
for shorts because I expect that daily

497
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,440
chart that big bullish green candle is

498
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,240
going to be redelivered to the downside

499
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,159
and the first level I'm looking for is

500
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,559
the halfway

501
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,760
point and the quadrant the lower

502
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,440
25% which is here and then dug into the

503
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,960
hourly chart by CB cell sign efficiency

504
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
which is what I mentioned earlier before

505
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,600
we got into this part of this video

506
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
that's where those two levels came from

507
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,320
and I quoted on Twitter before we got

508
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,520
down to

509
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,919
it the way that this inversion fair

510
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,240
valap is being

511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
implemented is my

512
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,080
model madus madus is a slang or nickname

513
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,200
used for the M2 machine gun okay so

514
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,080
that's just the way my mind works and

515
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,919
the way I kind of like classify things I

516
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,080
have 81 different PD arrays and there's

517
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,679
several things that I can do with each

518
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,840
one of those PD arrays this is simply an

519
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,880
inversion fair value Gap how I use that

520
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,559
fair value Gap is a model and if we have

521
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,400
a inefficiency as outlined here between

522
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,640
the

523
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,720
daily buy B cell efficiency high and low

524
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,039
we're bearish we're looking for lower

525
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,360
prices we get this Market structure in

526
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,559
agreement and then time of

527
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,400
price we're expecting an 8:30 delivery

528
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,080
we can get in here and use this and get

529
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,400
ahead of yes get ahead of and enter

530
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,559
before the news it's like an x-ray view

531
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,799
tips your hand or tips its hand to you

532
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,840
and tells you this is what it's likeing

533
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,240
to do and you have the inefficiency here

534
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,880
trades up into it and at the delivery of

535
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,200
8:30 news and then we see it run away on

536
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
the employment

537
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,120
numbers trading down

538
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,960
into the lower 25% quadrant between

539
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,320
between this low and this High lower

540
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,279
quarter or quadrant level is here Trad

541
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,000
still here and then trades to the 15 175

542
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
level and then ultimately we seen it go

543
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,799
higher from

544
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,279
there I'm going to zoom in a little

545
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,080
bit there's that

546
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,760
Gap so that inversion fair value Gap

547
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,640
within the context of expecting it to

548
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,480
trade

549
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
lower best case scenario you know being

550
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,640
the low of the daily B so icy for Nasdaq

551
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,200
but needing it not to do that to

552
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
profitability which is first partial

553
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,400
would be here at consequent encroachment

554
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,760
and you let it run some more to get down

555
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
to the lower quadrant and they that

556
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,520
level you want to take a partial and

557
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,000
then if you can get down to another

558
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
discount array which was in close

559
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
proximity which is only 10 handles away

560
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,480
which was that hourly B Bell and cell

561
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,600
deficiencies

562
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,039
low on this date and time on on your

563
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,440
hourly chart so that's why it's

564
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,679
annotated that way you can go back and

565
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,799
look at on your own charts I want to

566
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
take you back up again just know that

567
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,799
this is what I'm showing you

568
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,080
here this range how I'm employing the

569
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,520
inversion fair value Gap there here for

570
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,960
myu Mau is a model that you can use a

571
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,080
inversion fair value Gap when you are

572
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,159
expecting price to run right back down a

573
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
inefficiency that was buy side and

574
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,200
balance sell side in efficiency this can

575
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,360
be reversed when you have a sell sign

576
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
and balance buy side efficiency and

577
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
you're expecting price to go higher the

578
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,840
inversion fair value Gap here would be

579
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,440
something after a low and then would you

580
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,880
know trade back down to it and then send

581
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,679
it higher so everything here is just

582
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,840
completely

583
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
reversed and I know if you're brand new

584
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,640
to my stuff I'm sure I'm quite certain

585
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,919
you're you're probably confused right

586
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,760
now and you have to study but really

587
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,240
what I'm saying here

588
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,480
is this level here and this level here

589
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,159
on the hourly chart is

590
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,720
this this One Singular candle and what

591
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,600
I'm saying is on Thursday I was

592
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
anticipating the run down into at least

593
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,120
the lower

594
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,440
quadrant the lower 25% between

595
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,399
this and this which are these levels

596
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,520
here respectively this candle's low this

597
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,120
candle's high so we have One Singular

598
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,559
pass

599
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,520
higher we expect lower prices to be

600
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,279
delivered the same way just going back

601
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,840
down to

602
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,000
redeliver over the inefficiency here it

603
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,279
was buy side delivery but now it needs

604
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,640
sell-side delivery because it's

605
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
inefficient in that regard because

606
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,760
there's no other candle between this

607
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,840
candle's low and that candle's High only

608
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,240
one candle went higher and that range

609
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,320
defined by that candle here this low and

610
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,480
that high needs to have efficient

611
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,159
delivery that can only happen by having

612
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,919
price go back down inside this entire

613
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,520
range lower quadrant halfway point if

614
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,919
you have a inversion Fair value Gap and

615
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,279
you're bearish and you're expecting a

616
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,320
news report and it's tipped its hand to

617
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,520
you saying okay we are likely to break

618
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,720
lower in Market structure and a lower

619
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,279
time frames we can anticipate this

620
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
drop that's occurring in

621
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
here

622
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,159
drop and that's

623
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,039
occurring in

624
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,039
here

625
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,399
drop and zoomed in inside that

626
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,120
premium to

627
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,679
Discount that's the inversion per you

628
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,320
got

629
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,559
M second opportunity to get into it

630
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,520
again it breaks aggressively

631
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,240
inefficiency once more at 8:30

632
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,960
employment numbers runs aggressively

633
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,640
partial

634
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,200
here

635
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,039
partial best case scenario would be if

636
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,640
it would deliver to the low of the

637
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,080
hourly but I mentioned real time I said

638
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
take your profits don't be greedy and

639
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
then we seen it

640
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
go a little bit lower than my objective

641
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,760
on that particular day but never got to

642
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,039
the low of the daily B cell efficiency

643
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,520
being this level

644
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,440
here it never got to that level

645
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,760
so I'm certain it's a lot for you to

646
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,240
digest but every one of my PD arrays you

647
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,840
can apply it to specific elements of

648
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Market structure and how you anticipate

649
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,600
price delivering and you can plug and

650
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,000
play each one of these pdas with the

651
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,760
expectation that the model will deliver

652
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,200
under a

653
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,880
specific premise we're

654
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,399
expecting this level here to this level

655
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,000
here be delivered with downside delivery

656
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
in our sells side delivery as price was

657
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,840
going

658
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
lower it's not random it's not going to

659
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
some random level it's going to very

660
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,080
specific price levels and if I'm going

661
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,440
to use this inversion fair value Gap I

662
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,240
can use it in the context of myu modu is

663
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,559
simply a model utilizing an inversion

664
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,960
fair value Gap so that PD array it's an

665
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,960
advanced version or application of

666
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
inversion fair value Gap but it takes

667
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,039
you right back to the core context of

668
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,600
where are you in price what's it likely

669
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,679
to go to next and are you in a shortterm

670
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,760
premium or short-term discount if we're

671
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,200
bearish and we're in premium we can

672
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,880
anticipate price reaching down into a

673
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,960
discount but not some random level very

674
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,600
specific levels and it need not go to

675
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,880
the best case scenario which would be

676
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,720
the low which I still hold true that I I

677
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,000
suspect at some point maybe next week

678
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,320
that we'll try to reach down here until

679
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,760
I'm proven wrong and I'm I'm okay with

680
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,880
being proven wrong I'm going to be

681
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,000
trading it but the idea is I expect it

682
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,919
to trade down here because the E many

683
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,880
S&P has already traded it to its

684
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,360
respective bid and bell and cellid

685
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
efficiency for its daily

686
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
chart

687
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,880
all right folks that's it for this one

688
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,480
enjoy your weekend thanks for watching

689
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,480
until I'll talk to you next time be safe
