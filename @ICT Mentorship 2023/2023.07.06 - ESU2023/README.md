Cherrypicked hindsight...  
 
5 bars like it was nothing.  
Moonwalked right into my 15min BISI, Premium to Discount.

Observing...

The Lay Of The Land...  

The left chart is ETH ES in 1min timeframe.  
The right chart is RTH ES in 15min timeframe.  

Note my PD Arrays inside the 15min BISI and how the Opening Range Gap in blue is being repriced to.

Real Liquidity Voids are periods in time where neither buyers or sellers we given a opportunity to book a trade.  

These are "common gaps".  

Liquidity Voids are not my BISI or SIBI or FVGs.  These are periods where trading was booked... albeit inefficiently.  

Gaps > FVGs or other.

Where there is neither a wick, tail or candle body in an range of Price... 
this is the highest form of Draw On Liquidity, if your bias is correct.  

In between those Draws and where market price is at present... 
we use things like my PD Arrays to get in, out or manage trades.
