1
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,559
foreign

2
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,439
folks

3
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,180
long time no see how's everybody doing

4
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,159
I'm checking Twitter

5
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,560
I prompted uh those that follow me on

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,020
Twitter give me a five by five if the

7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,540
chart and my audio is good and the

8
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,799
volume is good for you let me know

9
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,640
as soon as I get a

10
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,020
5x5

11
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,420
from any of you I'll know I'm good to go

12
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,100
thank you folks thank you thank you

13
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
all right so

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,180
I may require

15
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
the

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,220
I gotta be careful it looks like the

17
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,720
volume is a little too loud goes into

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,240
the red so I'll have to talk like

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,818
I normally do

20
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,459
it should be fine anyway

21
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,840
now we have

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,040
a few things that we're going to cover

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
this morning

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,620
and if it is your first time here

25
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,040
watching a live stream from me uh

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
usually when I do a live stream I'll go

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,940
in I'll look at live PA and

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,160
depend upon how I

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,099
deliver how long ago this morning I

30
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,260
don't think I have a whole lot of time

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,020
for the for the teaching part of it in

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,660
the review uh it'll just depend on you

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,879
know what we do at the opening and we'll

34
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,680
see if we can look at some live price

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,500
action no promises but uh we'll see what

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,599
we see

37
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,360
it's important for you to keep up with

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,379
the ICT mentorship 2023 playlist so

39
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,819
anything that I've put up whether it be

40
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,500
a live stream like this

41
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,760
or another lecture I add it to the 2023

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
mentorship playlist on my YouTube

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,879
channel

44
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,640
if you're new okay and don't get this

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,660
out of the way here some short

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,819
housekeeping if you're brand new to my

47
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,260
channel and you want to know where to go

48
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,239
in and start

49
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,819
my advice is to go into the 2022

50
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,159
2022 ICT mentorship playlist it's 41

51
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,080
videos the the first video you really

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,780
don't really need to watch that one but

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,819
for completeness sake you know to say

54
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,379
you watched it the first one kind of

55
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,000
like sets the tone for what you're

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,140
trying to

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,239
or should be expecting

58
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
if you have never seen anything from my

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,260
content if you really don't know how to

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,420
read PA and you really just

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,620
want to get down to the Brass tax

62
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,720
because I am long-winded because I want

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,420
to give you value and if I'm going to

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,540
teach something I want to get

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
the highest form of understanding

66
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,080
communicated to those individuals that

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,299
want to learn if your short attention

68
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,060
span or if you are not really interested

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,159
in knowing everything about why you

70
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,780
would be incurring risk or taking on

71
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,760
risk

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,099
if anything less than that then you're

73
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,599
really setting yourself up for failure

74
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,239
so if a teacher or an educator is making

75
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
themselves available it's important that

76
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,199
their passion is behind that education

77
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,238
because your results

78
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,418
are a direct reflection on my ability to

79
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,240
communicate the logic and I want to

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
convey as much detail as possible

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,100
instead of just saying you know this is

82
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,240
what a Buy Signal looks like this is

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,740
what a sell system looks like and then

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,960
give you a static screenshot of this is

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,580
what it looks like all the time it

86
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,320
doesn't look like that all the time it's

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,580
slow there's like subtle little

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,040
variances in the way PA is

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,500
delivered and it's important for you

90
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,139
especially for someone that's new okay

91
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,060
or if you only

92
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,280
referred to PA through a

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,360
retail perspective and when I say that

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,800
when I say we don't trade retail or we

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
don't follow retail logic we're not

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,199
looking at the things that permeates

97
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,840
this industry which is collective in all

98
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
the books courses and regurgitated

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,040
so that's what makes my content

100
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,020
sometimes a little overwhelming or over

101
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,780
complicated because you're trying to

102
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,460
form fit the things that you think you

103
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,820
know into words I'm teaching and my

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,380
challenge has always been

105
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
don't believe what I said or say about

106
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,139
it go into your charts and see if what

107
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,360
it is I'm saying is there or not I'm

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,340
confident if you do the due diligence to

109
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,139
do that you will find it

110
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,199
okay so if you're new and you want to

111
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,900
like a study program I tweeted this the

112
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,639
other day on my Twitter account

113
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,180
but the best shortest cut

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,680
right to the point

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,300
pardon me

116
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,479
is the 2022 playlist that is a model

117
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,820
that I designed for my daughter

118
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,460
my heart went into it I wanted to make

119
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,800
it streamlined I wanted to present

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,539
something that was time based that way

121
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,479
it removes a lot of the when does it

122
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,759
form when would I look for a setup and I

123
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,680
don't know what session to trade I don't

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,180
know you know should I trade London

125
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,660
should I trade New York that pattern of

126
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,240
looking for that run on liquidity a

127
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
shift in Market structure and then going

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,539
into a FVG that can be traded

129
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,300
in Forex it can be traded in Futures

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,699
contracts index futures

131
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,340
currency Futures I have students I don't

132
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,259
trade crypto but I have students that

133
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,440
swear by their results being in crypto I

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
don't trade synthetic

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,460
things okay so I know I get a lot of

136
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,800
questions from the folks in Africa I

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
don't trade the volatility index okay so

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,360
I don't do anything crypto

139
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,060
but that model is something that you can

140
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,160
go right into the marketplace and start

141
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,340
studying and seeing it and watching

142
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,139
other students when they share their

143
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,000
examples and or results with me on

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Twitter

145
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,660
many times you're seeing that very model

146
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,680
form and that model is in my opinion and

147
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
I may be incorrect in this but I'm

148
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
assuming a great deal here and give me

149
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,440
the Liberty to do this because I'm going

150
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,600
by what I'm seeing in this feedback a

151
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,340
lot of the funded companies

152
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,199
are coming forward and you know

153
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,060
basically stating that

154
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,060
majority of their profitable payouts are

155
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,580
coming from my student base

156
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,340
so that's a testimony in itself what are

157
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,960
they using what was the thing that

158
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,460
bridged that gap between not really

159
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,660
knowing what they're doing and going in

160
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
and finding money finding profitability

161
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,960
finding consistency

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,880
I believe in the ones I've interviewed

163
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
and once it's reached out to me it's the

164
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,780
2022 model and I have charter members

165
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,220
that have paid me

166
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,979
to learn one-on-one not in the sense

167
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:44,880
that they're sitting right next to me

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,860
but this is what I did with them every

169
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,199
day I would sit down I'd go through the

170
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
charts and I'd explain them what they

171
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,840
would expect to see in the PA

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
and I'm in the high 90 of accuracy and

173
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
it's been like that for years in the

174
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,819
witness of thousands of people now

175
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,919
there's hundreds of thousands of people

176
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,720
that are publicly

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,840
watching this stuff happen and

178
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,120
that model can be used on intraday

179
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,680
charts it could be used on higher time

180
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,660
frame charts and I've been beat up

181
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,880
lately with a lot of requests for coming

182
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,580
off of the lower intraday charts a lot

183
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,900
of you don't want to trade or can't

184
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,240
trade those one and five minute charts I

185
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,520
understand that but I also include and

186
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,460
as I'm including it right here

187
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,699
that same approach to using this shorter

188
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,259
time frame charts

189
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,599
the only reason why I'm doing that

190
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,120
is because it affords me lots of

191
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
examples that we can see there's there's

192
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,679
consistency and using the logic you can

193
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,419
find continuity in your analysis and

194
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,899
therefore results could be expected to

195
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,180
pretty much be you know routine or

196
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,860
business like you know if you go to your

197
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,940
job you're not changing what you're

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,019
doing every single day you're doing the

199
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,940
same monotonous tasks all the time and

200
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,200
as a Trader that's what you're trying to

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
do you want it to be boring and

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
monotonous and

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,180
the the best way I can communicate it

204
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,160
was that 2022 model

205
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
I couldn't make another model simpler

206
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,620
than that and it's working it's working

207
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,019
in the hands of other people and even

208
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,760
for people that just started following

209
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,920
me last year they got funded and they're

210
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
getting payouts and they're doing well

211
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,519
some of them are trading their actual

212
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,580
live money in my personal opinion when

213
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,200
this is my personal opinion this is not

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
to discourage any of you I don't think

215
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,080
you should be trading in your first year

216
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,519
there's a lot of things you'll learn

217
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,899
about yourself and there's a lot of

218
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,220
things about PA that you have

219
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,740
to learn as well but that can't be

220
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,000
appreciated

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,620
if you just go and watch a couple videos

222
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,240
in this thing let me see if it works

223
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
with my account and then risk real money

224
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,500
or risk you

225
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,019
not being successful with a combine or a

226
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,420
challenge from a funded you know prop

227
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,920
firm or whatever

228
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,620
so just go slow I promise you

229
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,660
the folks that are doing very well

230
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,600
they put a lot of work into this before

231
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,399
they did it and I'm talking about the

232
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,200
the six figure earners you know the guy

233
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
just did 300 000 in three months another

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
guy you know

235
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,480
um jade

236
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,240
he uh he's killing half a million

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,980
dollars okay folks this isn't Mickey

238
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,959
Mouse money okay that's that's real

239
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,740
money

240
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,380
it's not demo you know these guys are

241
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,720
killing it Paladin killing it I have

242
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,399
lots of other people that are getting

243
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,720
ready to come forward as well that are

244
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
just smashing it in their own accounts

245
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,060
not doing prop funded accounts

246
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,920
take your time

247
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,200
Nothing's Gonna Change okay the

248
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,519
algorithm is going to change they're not

249
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,260
going to turn around because ICT has

250
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,240
told too many people about it

251
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,240
the markets have always booked like this

252
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,560
and the only thing that's going to

253
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
change in the future is it's going to be

254
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,579
much more efficient

255
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,399
so it'll be less of the the choppy

256
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
consolidation because there'll be a lot

257
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
more people involved therefore the

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,019
liquidity increases

259
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,839
so it's not a disadvantage to you

260
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,820
or a reason for you to be concerned

261
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,860
about more people growing in our

262
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,940
community

263
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,880
using my content it's literally going to

264
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,180
make more liquidity for efficiency we're

265
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,940
not going to be the buy stock read then

266
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,579
reversal that's we capitalize on that

267
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,079
retail mindset

268
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,180
my approach to trading and teaching you

269
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,660
is that we Harvest liquidity

270
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,279
we hunt it it's prey retail logic things

271
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,839
like moving average Crossovers and

272
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,040
things like that there's a place for

273
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,140
that it does make money you can make

274
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,700
money flipping a quarter but

275
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,240
predominantly there is

276
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,980
a large degree of

277
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
well

278
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,640
neophytes that enter the marketplace and

279
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,380
when I first started and I promised this

280
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,399
at the end we're getting into the

281
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,720
teaching but it's important for you to

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,940
know where we're we're going where you

283
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,560
should be in your expectations and

284
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
learning

285
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,640
but retail-minded Traders think that

286
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,760
every single time a overbought or sold

287
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,800
oscillator goes oversold therefore the

288
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,839
market should go up and that's not true

289
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,380
and I I learned that lesson hard in my

290
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,899
first year and well first year and a

291
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,120
half I was insisting upon buying

292
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,980
oversold conditions all the time

293
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,200
and I didn't understand bear markets so

294
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
it can stay oversold for a long time and

295
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,420
you could be buying falling daggers and

296
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,399
it's very painful trying to catch that

297
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,779
and

298
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,560
what I have done in my career is try to

299
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,360
communicate things that you wouldn't

300
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,640
really learn from anyone else

301
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,800
and make it into a language that way

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,720
it's communicated

303
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,600
through charts when the things that make

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,880
these price moves run are not actually

305
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,260
in charts

306
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,600
and that sounds like imp like it's an

307
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,760
impossible thing

308
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,560
there are things that are occurring

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,779
outside of the kill zones I talk about

310
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,240
there are traits that occur

311
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,120
but I could never

312
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,040
bridge the gap between what I know about

313
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,079
what's going on therefore finding a

314
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,019
chart that is repeating all the time or

315
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,720
enough times to make a a setup you know

316
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,240
for it so the things I teach you like

317
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,200
specific PD arrays a multiplier when I

318
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,240
say when you're looking for a setup

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,860
you're looking for what is your

320
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,720
multiplier your multiplier is the thing

321
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,880
that you use to get in that's not a

322
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,959
model

323
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
okay it's the the multiplier that puts

324
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
you in a trade whether it be my order

325
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
block whether it be a fair value guy

326
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,639
inversion or standard if it's a

327
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,440
institutional Oracle entry drill an

328
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
optimal trade entry okay a propulsion

329
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,980
block

330
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,839
all these things are specific

331
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,399
multipliers the things that you're

332
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,980
looking for in PA I teach you

333
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,899
know I think it's in month four of the

334
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,760
core content and forgive me if I'm not

335
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,380
being accurate but I think I think it's

336
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,000
where it is month four where I go

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,680
through the pdre Matrix

338
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,139
those are in my opinion they're the ones

339
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,940
that is the easiest for me to

340
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,019
communicate using a time-based chart

341
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,980
now that I have other PD arrays that are

342
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,500
not requiring a chart like I don't need

343
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,040
a chart but that's so complicated and

344
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
some of you complain about what I've

345
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,339
already taught as being complicated I'm

346
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,440
not even going to touch that like I

347
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,180
don't need to have a chart I could be

348
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,220
driving around my Corvette know that at

349
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,100
this time between these three minutes I

350
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
know it's going to do this and then I

351
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,639
know it's going to go this and I know

352
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,920
that that's algorithmic

353
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,380
but you you're here to learn how to do

354
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,639
something that repeats over and over

355
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,440
again you can visually see that you can

356
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,459
trust

357
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,100
and that 2022 model I promise you if you

358
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,320
study that and spend time with it in

359
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,720
between your practice sessions and back

360
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,860
testing that means going back and

361
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,360
looking at chart moves that have

362
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
happened

363
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,120
um

364
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,220
it builds this experience space that you

365
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,720
that you require to lean on

366
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,579
I have had a lot of requests

367
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,779
for longer term swing trades so I teach

368
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,639
in the core content quarterly shifts

369
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,500
that means like every two to three

370
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,720
months there is a major intermediate

371
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
term

372
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,779
price swing that takes place on the

373
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,980
daily and weekly charts

374
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,519
that is a like a macro perspective so

375
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,019
when you sit down

376
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,699
like right now I'm sitting down for the

377
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:27,779
first time

378
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,339
being away from the charts for a few

379
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,860
days I did some day trading on Friday I

380
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
might share some of that with you when

381
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,860
we get into es but the

382
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,899
I teach

383
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,019
in the Twitter spaces that I do

384
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,820
and also in all the things that I'm

385
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,220
rambling about usually in these videos

386
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,180
or presentations

387
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,380
if you feel like I am not getting to the

388
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,060
point the point is is I'm teaching you

389
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,380
how you're going to have to navigate

390
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,579
these things

391
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,920
and one of the things I talk about in

392
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,440
the realm of psychology is if you're

393
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,060
under a lot of stress

394
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,399
not feeling well I had a loss of in your

395
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,139
family or whatever it's important not to

396
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,820
trade it's important to stay away from

397
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,440
the charts because you're going to be

398
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,760
hurting

399
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,139
in that pain that discomfort that

400
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,839
boredom can even you know spurt on

401
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,940
you're going to do something impulsively

402
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,399
so

403
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,540
yeah I've been going through something

404
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,300
emotionally with you know a pet

405
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,820
so I can't focus so that's why I've

406
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,860
spent some time away she's improving

407
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,079
thank you but uh

408
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
I I can't focus when it's like that and

409
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,420
some of you communicate that same type

410
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,820
of thing in other facets of your life in

411
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,560
Twitter you know you're going through a

412
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,300
breakup and you've been sick you just

413
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,639
got fired and then you're wondering why

414
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,820
you're not seeing success or consistency

415
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,019
in your trading because you're

416
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,639
emotionally charged

417
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,740
so even though my Concepts I believe are

418
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,420
superior

419
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,360
you as the operator me as the Opera I'm

420
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,339
the author of this stuff and if I am

421
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,660
sitting in front of the charts and I'm

422
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,660
in a state of mind that is unstable

423
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,419
I'm hurting I'm emotionally charged you

424
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,280
know I'm sick

425
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,260
or I'm fatigued if I haven't slept in

426
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,959
two days you know it's usually when I

427
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,359
need a nap and sometimes that happens a

428
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,579
lot so whatever those things are is

429
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,500
going to be for you that as a as a

430
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,540
barrier or a distraction

431
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,819
or if you feel an overwhelming desire to

432
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,620
want to trade because you feel like you

433
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,000
need something to make you feel good or

434
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,820
get high off of it don't don't consider

435
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,160
my Concepts as the Silver Bullet quote

436
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,860
unquote to fix that for you

437
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,320
because you can fail even with these

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,539
high-end High Precision elements that

439
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm teaching you you as the operator

440
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,380
will fail yourself just like I would

441
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,179
have failed myself if I would have

442
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,000
pushed last week and did things that I

443
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,860
knew I wasn't going to be focusing on

444
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,900
it doesn't mean that the logic is flawed

445
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,640
it doesn't mean that your ability to

446
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,059
trade is expired it just means that you

447
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,919
are not firing on all cylinders that

448
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,360
means you're not focused

449
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,580
and you're going to be impulsive you're

450
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,460
going to be reactive okay we don't react

451
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,100
to price we anticipate it but if you go

452
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
into the charts with a need to be right

453
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,799
a need to feel better to feel like you

454
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,260
are not worthless because maybe someone

455
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,700
broke up with you

456
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,880
those things will channel into and

457
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,740
you'll actually see a setup

458
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,539
because you want it to be there versus

459
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,679
it being there so just be mindful that

460
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,140
when I'm teaching you that you have a

461
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,120
great deal of responsibility you have

462
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,340
that responsibility and your success is

463
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,400
solely yours but your failures you have

464
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,740
to own them too I don't co-sign for

465
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,940
either one of them

466
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,360
so with all that Preamble and monologue

467
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,940
out of the way let's get into it

468
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,520
I mentioned uh the last few times we

469
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,520
were doing market reviews and Analysis I

470
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,500
talked about how

471
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,780
the

472
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,400
let me go over my chart I'm talking to

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,660
you with the

474
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,960
YouTube Studio it's not gonna help me

475
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,400
there we are

476
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,120
so this is the dollar Index and it's

477
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,299
shown on a weekly chart

478
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,900
so

479
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,220
I mentioned that we would likely reach

480
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,260
up into and we wanted to see get up into

481
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,179
the halfway point of this last up close

482
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,820
candle prior to this rotation lower

483
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,760
so this upkin over here

484
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,100
the initial draw was that order blocks

485
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,500
open price

486
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
that's what's being denoted here we saw

487
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,240
it expand up from that it tells you that

488
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,740
this Gap here I wanted to see that

489
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,900
treated as an inversion Gap

490
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,880
okay or inversion fair value cap that's

491
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,059
what's the ifbg stands for

492
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,660
now this is the problem that will arise

493
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,120
if you're watching someone that is

494
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,520
trying to teach my Concepts when they're

495
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,320
not even fully taught yet

496
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,780
they would see this Gap here

497
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,280
and it runs up and they'll think okay

498
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,780
that's a short because look at these

499
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,520
relative equal lows down here

500
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
no

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,240
there's a logic that has to be applied

502
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,820
to it and a narrative

503
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,039
the fact that we have unfinished

504
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,220
business

505
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,140
in this order block

506
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,880
there is

507
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
uncertainty

508
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,900
there's a lot of you know

509
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,360
there was concern about the U.S debt

510
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,179
ceiling potential default

511
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,320
um

512
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,340
the the war scenario on the other side

513
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,980
of the world okay all these things

514
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,340
are causing concern and that concern is

515
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,660
a

516
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,179
Catalyst for flight to Quality

517
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,960
or a safe haven and at the time at the

518
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,480
present the dollar is still considered

519
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,320
that but I think it's waning nonetheless

520
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,780
that sense

521
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,179
typically the the dollar higher in

522
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,799
foreign currency is lower and we're

523
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,620
going to talk about 4x7 to work today

524
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,860
and not just es but uh I started with

525
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,059
the dollar Index because the dollar

526
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,780
gives me that risk on risk off scenario

527
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,100
now

528
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,620
if I believe that the dollar

529
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,299
is likely to go higher I need to know

530
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,679
where it's going to likely draw to I

531
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,480
just can't just indiscriminately go out

532
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,340
there and think well

533
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,660
it's going to go up let's just see where

534
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,539
it goes let's just find out okay that

535
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,600
that to me is myopic

536
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,760
you know you need to have a specific

537
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,159
level not a Zone

538
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,620
okay and not a not a supplier demand

539
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Zone there's specific levels that I'm

540
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,480
teaching

541
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,600
this last up close candle

542
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,039
right here

543
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,980
has the low

544
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,039
the opening price and the mean threshold

545
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
which is the halfway point from high to

546
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,039
low

547
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,260
that's what those levels are the last

548
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,780
time we talked I said we would like to

549
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,820
see it get up into and I said we'll see

550
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,559
if it wants to get up to mean threshold

551
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,960
of that order block right there

552
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,940
nothing said we're going short on dollar

553
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,700
I didn't say we're shorting anything in

554
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,600
dollar

555
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,820
we were looking for lower prices on euro

556
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,919
dollar and we'll cover your dollar when

557
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,539
we get a dollar

558
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,539
so in fact we saw a price run up into it

559
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,220
last week and now here we are on the

560
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,299
present week

561
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,580
this is this present current

562
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,820
weekly Candlestick for the dollar Index

563
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,960
did this Gap over here act as support

564
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,100
yes

565
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,280
intra week it did it on this week but

566
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
then last week it did it as well traded

567
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,799
down into it and now we're trading here

568
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,280
so

569
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,260
when we when we get a LTF

570
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,960
daily chart this will be more impactful

571
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,740
too but uh whenever I give analysis out

572
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,620
whether it be through a tweet or in

573
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,640
video

574
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,860
invariably there's this sect of my

575
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,900
followers that will say Okay now what's

576
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,700
going to happen

577
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,520
when you should be thinking about what

578
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,740
you just watched and have you broke it

579
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,020
down yourself have you

580
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,880
spent any time in the LTFs

581
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,820
individual sessions individual days over

582
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,039
the scope of each individual weekly

583
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,580
candle and see where the setups form

584
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,500
with the 2022 model

585
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,940
because that's what you're supposed to

586
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,960
be doing

587
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,520
if you're just waiting for me to put up

588
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,500
a new video or talk about something on

589
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,179
Twitter you're really doing yourself a

590
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,440
disservice because

591
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,380
a lot of the work 90 of the work for you

592
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,799
succeeding is done by you it isn't just

593
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,840
by listening to me because if it was

594
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,340
that easy everybody that watches my

595
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,320
videos would be funded making money and

596
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,640
quitting their job and be rich and

597
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,580
where's all the odds right

598
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,440
they don't do the work and that's why

599
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
it's offensive sometimes when I tell

600
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
people you're not putting in the work

601
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,799
because what you think the work is

602
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,799
is many times insignificant it's not

603
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,520
enough

604
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
and you have to put real time into it

605
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,840
and what you're doing in that time is

606
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
spending it in Old moves

607
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,340
using the logic and the experience I've

608
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,960
shared I told you that I was wanting the

609
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,020
dollar to go higher that was go back and

610
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,220
listen to the commentaries it's there

611
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,020
it's not ambiguous

612
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,360
but because I State my opinion there's a

613
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,039
lot more of you publicly that are

614
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,440
following me you sometimes are weighted

615
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,000
on baited breath just to hear me say

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,100
something and you take that and you go

617
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,200
out there and you bet real money with it

618
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
and that's why I said don't bet the

619
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,559
farmer I'm constantly reminding you

620
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,900
there's risk if you don't know what

621
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,720
you're doing don't be deceived in

622
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,340
thinking you think you know what you're

623
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,720
doing simply because you watched a few

624
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,100
of my videos

625
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,440
it takes time to learn this and you have

626
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,960
to give yourself the time and patience

627
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,419
that's needed to do it

628
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,400
so we did in fact see the inversion fair

629
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,460
value Gap form here and we're rotated up

630
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,960
into

631
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
daily bearish order block this right

632
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
here will be much more

633
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,539
easier to see and understand now let me

634
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,470
go into a daily chart

635
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,559
[Music]

636
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,179
okay so here's that daily candle so it

637
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,760
looks just like that Weekly candle we've

638
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,980
got this big old runoff here like that

639
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,159
it does not folks listen okay

640
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,520
it does not need to be an engulfing

641
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,380
candle that does not make an order block

642
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,179
okay so many people out there typing

643
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,880
that stuff up in pseudo mentorships

644
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,000
things and like that's not that's not my

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
order block okay

646
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,779
the idea of

647
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,140
the market rotating after hitting a key

648
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,299
level

649
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,700
you take it right to the last candle

650
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
that candle does not need to be

651
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,600
engulfing anything

652
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,340
that narrative that's the thing that's

653
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,020
missing from these 20 year olds that run

654
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,279
around thinking they know how to do this

655
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,039
stuff and I'm talking to you because I

656
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,779
know you're listening okay I'm telling

657
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,039
you these things so that way you can

658
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,659
improve and not hurt the people that

659
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,179
you're trying to fleece

660
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,799
and being more responsible with your

661
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,320
students than you are so here's the

662
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,020
bearish order block the opening price

663
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,120
now why am I using the opening price

664
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,380
versus the low Whenever there is a

665
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,240
short little stubby tail or Wick okay

666
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,760
whenever it's like that I generally as a

667
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
rule of thumb but not always but

668
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,220
generally most of the time I'm going to

669
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,440
go right to the opening price and the

670
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,480
reason why I'm doing that okay and this

671
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,539
is where you write things down folks

672
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,179
this small little

673
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,220
tail on the candle

674
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,380
I know that there's probably something

675
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,240
in that LTF that I'll be

676
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,659
able to use even if it wants to go

677
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,960
outside the realm of the opening price

678
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,640
so I may be able to look at something

679
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,700
that may or may not be supportive for a

680
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,779
trade

681
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,580
in that range but

682
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,340
for a anchoring on a HTF

683
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,600
basis

684
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm anchoring it to the opening price

685
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,080
now let's assume for a moment that it

686
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,880
was a longer

687
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,500
tail in other words this little segment

688
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,240
down here on the candle say that was

689
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,220
longer and the opening was actually

690
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,020
something or somewhere up here

691
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,140
then I would use the low

692
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,460
and I would use the consequent

693
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,380
encouragement of that tail or halfway

694
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,720
point of that little Wick

695
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,580
so those are the two key levels I'll use

696
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,039
for a Candlestick that has a longer Wick

697
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,260
okay so there's a little bit more

698
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,779
insight about water blocks

699
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,340
and I'm telling you why I'm using the

700
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,419
opening price versus the lower high so

701
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,860
I had that in your notes and go through

702
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,900
your studies and you'll see that that's

703
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,059
a very good general rule to help you

704
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,640
okay there will be instances where it

705
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,340
does other things okay but I'm not done

706
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,740
teaching but just grow and what I'm

707
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,240
tearing what I'm sharing to him giving

708
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,260
it to you

709
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,419
so we have the weekly order block we

710
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,520
traded out in through it hit the daily

711
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
bearish order block we traded up into

712
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
that now look at the bodies of these

713
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,840
candles

714
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,460
weekly order block

715
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,340
daily order block look at all that

716
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,200
encapsulation and PA the

717
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,059
volume

718
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,100
of all that Trading

719
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,919
the majority of it's being shown in the

720
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,620
Candlestick bodies yes it expanded as we

721
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,600
would like to see anyway we're expecting

722
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,820
a new higher it went above these levels

723
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,679
we don't expect it to stop dead in its

724
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,720
tracks when we're bullish we really want

725
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,419
to see it go to it and through it

726
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,580
because the narrative the expectation we

727
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,820
had was that dollar should go higher

728
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,940
and notice that all of the

729
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,760
sustained price runs was on the buy side

730
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
delivery that means candlesticks that

731
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,240
are going up

732
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,640
infrequent were the down closed candles

733
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
these are daily candlesticks by the way

734
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,200
but look how it opened here

735
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,880
traded away from it

736
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,640
opened right up here and then traded

737
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,419
down

738
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,419
we expanded through and fell short of

739
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,400
the mean threshold of the weekly order

740
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
block and it's important that you

741
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,940
annotate your levels

742
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,500
now I'm showing you how I do this here

743
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,120
and some of you ask all the time how am

744
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,610
I doing that

745
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,120
[Music]

746
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,400
on trading view this is what I have set

747
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,539
up as middle

748
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,059
Center for it to appear here and when

749
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm doing the new week opening gaps

750
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,580
it would just show on the right so it

751
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,200
shows over here

752
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,820
and you'll see the new week opening Gap

753
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,440
when we get into ES

754
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,140
so we're seeing it dig into these levels

755
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,880
expanding up reaching reaching reaching

756
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,760
and then finally once it pierced the

757
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,440
mean threshold the weekly order block at

758
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,720
104.540

759
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,179
then we had a rotation lower

760
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,279
where'd it go back to

761
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,399
that Weekly inversion Gap the fair rate

762
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,559
Gap that we anticipated seeing act as

763
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,779
what support folks that's narrative

764
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,580
that's not picking both sides of the

765
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,799
marketplace if I'm telling you a

766
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,740
specific PD array

767
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,799
that level

768
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,520
on that PD array if it's a range

769
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,360
like a fair value got it's the high

770
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,860
consequent encroaching which is the

771
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,700
midpoint

772
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,340
and then the low of it that's not a Zone

773
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,320
where you am it's ambiguous like where

774
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,360
do you trade a supply and demand Zone

775
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,000
okay that's why I'm not supplying demand

776
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,220
and I also cut through candles supply

777
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,200
and demand would not use this level over

778
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,220
here

779
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,960
based on anything like that because they

780
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,700
say don't we don't cut through candles

781
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,559
they need a fresh Zone everything from

782
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,899
ICT is fresh baby everything there's

783
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,059
nothing stale here we always have fresh

784
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,799
bread and my students are always making

785
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,600
fresh bread they do it on their own they

786
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,039
don't ever run out of yeast just like

787
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,240
this meant they're talking to you I

788
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,860
don't ever run out of yeast you're never

789
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,480
going to run out of opportunities it's

790
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,279
never going to happen there's no reason

791
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,899
for you to rush it because once you get

792
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,080
it nobody can take it from you nobody

793
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
can say you can't do it because they

794
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,559
don't like you they don't like your

795
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,600
personality whatever you can find these

796
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,039
setups once you have the understanding

797
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,260
you can go into any Market any time

798
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,299
frame and murder it

799
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,940
literally murder it

800
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,820
but you're trying to be too quick to

801
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,799
assume that everything that you already

802
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,299
know

803
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,000
will complement what I'm teaching you no

804
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,799
no no no no no no no

805
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,080
what I'm teaching you will make the

806
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,580
stuff you tried to be profitable with

807
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,640
profitable if you Inc if you include the

808
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,980
things I'm teaching how to reprice the

809
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,360
DOL that's the first

810
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,299
lesson the first lesson I start to drive

811
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,240
home in a student's mind is where's the

812
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,299
price trying to gravitate to where is it

813
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,460
trying to get to well initially I

814
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,340
started with the order block weekly then

815
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,100
the daily and the mean threshold of that

816
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
Weekly order block does your chart show

817
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,279
this because you're looking at a live

818
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,840
chart right now with me in the live

819
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,620
stream

820
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,500
did it pan out like I showed absolutely

821
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,640
it did

822
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,220
the same direction I was looking for

823
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,260
everything I was looking for in terms of

824
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,020
the specific levels I gave you the logic

825
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,760
I talked about it beforehand it's here

826
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,440
now

827
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,320
so it wasn't done with a one minute

828
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,020
chart it wasn't traded or worked with in

829
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,380
a second chart sub one minute time frame

830
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,600
it wasn't even an hourly chart I used

831
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,820
weekly charts

832
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,340
it works folks you can make this work

833
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,760
for you where you are at in your life

834
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,960
School business job your relationship

835
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,279
causes constraints that you can't do the

836
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,159
intraday charts I get it but don't think

837
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,720
that it's a one-trick pony that only

838
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,760
works on a one-minute chart there's a

839
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,500
lot of one minute setups that allow me

840
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,299
to teach you that there's no short

841
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,039
supply of setups

842
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,500
you will always find setups

843
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,059
but there's going to be times when the

844
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,860
market will be

845
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,140
well look at all this mess in here I

846
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,299
don't like these types of periods I

847
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,440
don't like that and that's why you see

848
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,659
me do what I took time away I did road

849
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,279
trips

850
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,320
now looking at the PA in

851
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,240
hindsight that makes perfect sense to

852
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
you while I was doing what I was doing

853
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
right but at the time you're thinking oh

854
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,760
they changed the algorithm ict's On The

855
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,620
Run

856
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,860
no I'm relaxing because I know that all

857
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,600
I need to do is see a shift in Market

858
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,620
structure what was that

859
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,460
see this high

860
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,460
it breaks it what does it leave Fair

861
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,899
there you go

862
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,279
see that

863
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,019
now

864
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,000
we're going to talk about gaps today my

865
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,880
personal private students and the public

866
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,140
students all of you could probably

867
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,880
majority of you here

868
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,899
um

869
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,720
are constantly asking this question you

870
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,640
can you talk about the Breakaway gaps

871
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,919
can you talk about when FVGs

872
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,080
should not fill I'm going to teach you

873
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,200
about that today okay so

874
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,519
if we're looking for

875
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,799
a DOL

876
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,940
and we are in this vicinity right here

877
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,679
the first thing we want to draw our

878
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,320
attention to was this imbalance here

879
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,240
that shaded area now what I'm showing to

880
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,320
you on the daily chart and that's the

881
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,000
time frame this is being shown in right

882
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,040
now for the dollar Index I promise you

883
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,580
all of this works in

884
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,599
es it works in Forex because I'm

885
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,760
starting the whole presentation this is

886
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,679
going to be 4X in the beginning and then

887
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,780
I'll end the discussion and in today's

888
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,540
live stream on the index features

889
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,060
but everything I'm teaching you here is

890
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,659
applicable to Forex and Futures and

891
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,540
commodities and gold

892
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,099
and bonds we're going to talk about

893
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,859
bonds today too okay but all of this

894
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
HTF gives you in my

895
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
opinion you're welcome to disagree

896
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,460
you're never going to convince me

897
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,399
otherwise but the HTFs is

898
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,839
where the majority of your time should

899
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:55,980
be spent

900
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,520
because it's so easy to get lost on

901
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,020
these LTF charts especially

902
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,520
if you're new because you'll think you

903
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,900
see all kinds of stuff you know the

904
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,460
Three Stooges pattern you know there

905
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,020
isn't one that I'm just making a joke

906
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,000
about how everything can be applied to

907
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
any time frame if you wanted to be there

908
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,520
you'll see it it's like a mirage

909
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,560
you're thirsty you want to get that uh

910
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,740
that new drink of uh success

911
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,540
and just like sometimes in a desert

912
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,920
you'll think you see something out there

913
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,359
it looks like water and you get up on it

914
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,740
it's just more sand

915
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,420
and you don't want to fill your well

916
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,820
with sand by chasing setups that are not

917
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,640
there they're Phantoms

918
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,280
HTF removes most of that

919
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,339
not all of it removes most of it so

920
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,440
let's let's talk about and again I'm

921
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,480
gonna before I get into any discussion I

922
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
want to take you back to the weekly

923
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,700
chart and show you what this is again

924
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,140
this shaded area

925
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,400
right here

926
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,619
real quickly

927
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,140
I like to be complete folks I don't like

928
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,339
to leave

929
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,300
anything up for

930
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,980
debate

931
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,140
that little section between this candle

932
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,839
here that low

933
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,200
and this candles hi and the reason why

934
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
I'm drawing attention to that is let me

935
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,760
take this away just for a second

936
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,859
can you see how this candle dropped

937
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,320
stopped the next candle here opened

938
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,200
traded down all the way here and came

939
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,240
back and stopped the next week it opened

940
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,220
traded up a little bit but didn't come

941
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,720
back all the way to that candle's load

942
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,800
see that

943
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,280
so there's this distinct Gap separation

944
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,040
between those two key levels there and

945
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,480
then we expand lower

946
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,060
we open trade up leaving this little

947
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,800
portion of PA between these

948
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,960
candles low and this candle is high

949
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,240
remained open

950
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,640
okay so it's only dropped down so that's

951
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,740
sell side delivery what is it

952
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,359
inefficient

953
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,060
by side so it's a city sell side

954
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,700
inefficiency buy side

955
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,940
oh I said that wrong sell side imbalance

956
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,820
beside and efficiency City

957
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,160
that little distinct Gap there

958
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,440
stands out if we're standing over here

959
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,960
on the the right of all this price

960
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,900
action look how fortified all these back

961
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,940
and forth movements are here

962
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,700
all these candles moving back between

963
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,160
over and over again inside of this range

964
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,400
here

965
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,140
you see how that is back and forth back

966
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,760
and forth back and forth back and forth

967
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,520
that is not inefficient at all

968
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,980
that's a lot of back and forth delivery

969
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,599
in other words think of the analogy how

970
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,180
many times you use like a paint being

971
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,020
applied with a roller on a wall

972
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,300
in this area paint has been distributed

973
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,400
back and forth in in paint and this

974
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,520
analogy would be price so the range of

975
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,760
offering liquidity up and down in that

976
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,079
shaded area

977
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,180
there's no inefficiency whatsoever on

978
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,859
this time frame so where does the

979
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,680
inefficiency exist

980
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,800
thank you

981
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,119
right there

982
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,640
it only has one roll down

983
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,060
never up until we get over here

984
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,480
Okay so

985
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,640
that FVG there was the draw

986
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,579
up and the context was I want to see it

987
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,500
trade up through it and come down and

988
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,760
act as support

989
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,200
and that would make it an inversion for

990
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,640
your value guy

991
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,180
if I didn't hold that expectation

992
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,339
it would be treated as a standard fair

993
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,740
value Gap in a premium relative to the

994
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,640
high

995
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,619
in the low here

996
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,619
that would be a premium Fair Vega and

997
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,060
the way you know that is you take the

998
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,560
FIB

999
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,420
anchored on high

1000
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,880
down to the low here's equilibrium and

1001
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
the FVG exists right there at

1002
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
equilibrium or above is premium at

1003
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,700
equilibrium or below is discount

1004
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,800
but I did not say we're looking for

1005
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,540
lower prices when it got to this fair

1006
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,099
value Gap I said we want to see it go to

1007
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,599
it throw it and come back down and treat

1008
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,579
it as support that's an inversion fair

1009
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:15,599
value

1010
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,420
don't take my word for it here go back

1011
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,460
and look at the other reviews that I've

1012
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,140
showed here go and look at the tweets

1013
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,200
listen to the Twitter spaces sometimes I

1014
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,900
cuss there just be mindful that you know

1015
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,300
it's live here I try to

1016
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,160
I tend to do the better job because I'm

1017
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,300
looking at candlesticks but if I don't

1018
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,380
have a Candlestick chart in front of me

1019
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,359
on Twitter spaces I generally use blue

1020
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,640
collar language and my imbalance is

1021
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,640
inside me just make me not the best

1022
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,960
Mentor for that

1023
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,660
but that little Gap here is this segment

1024
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,220
when we go down to LTF

1025
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,420
daily chart

1026
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,680
now you know what you're looking at

1027
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
all right there see it doesn't look like

1028
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,339
a gap here because look what it's done

1029
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,800
it passes back and forth back and forth

1030
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,220
okay do not assume this is really

1031
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,440
important do not assume

1032
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
that a inefficiency whether it be a fair

1033
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,820
value Gap

1034
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,020
that's

1035
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,780
a bicycle sound efficiency or a sell

1036
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,220
signing balance biasound efficiency

1037
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,780
either or

1038
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,079
don't assume if it's on the daily chart

1039
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,940
that if you see on

1040
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,640
or a weekly chart rather don't think

1041
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,079
that we see these back and forth moves

1042
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,880
on a daily chart that now makes this a

1043
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,400
balanced price range it doesn't

1044
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,500
because on the weekly time frame it's

1045
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,720
inefficient still

1046
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,520
the HTFs have to have

1047
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,140
bodies hit the floor

1048
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,000
that means it's got to cover that Gap

1049
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,560
even though these individual daily

1050
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,740
candles have worked inside that range

1051
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,740
that's not you're seeing the formation

1052
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,560
of that Weekly FVG with all

1053
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,839
of this in here

1054
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,240
on the daily chart it's

1055
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,859
it's something you have to study on your

1056
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:56,579
own

1057
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,680
working a HTF down to

1058
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,079
LTF the HTFs

1059
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,480
are apparent

1060
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,480
the LTFs are subordinate

1061
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,060
they're only going to behave in a manner

1062
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,740
that allows

1063
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,660
certain price delivery within the

1064
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,000
context and constructs of a higher time

1065
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,940
frame imbalance or liquidity pool that's

1066
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,780
it that's the the

1067
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,780
Continuum what you're looking for Market

1068
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,660
has to go up to a premium

1069
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,160
for what

1070
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,859
only two reasons it's going up to take

1071
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,480
the buy stops

1072
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,579
or it's going up to some inefficiency

1073
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,040
some Gap

1074
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,380
markets only go down

1075
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,480
to go to an inefficiency a fair value

1076
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,700
Gap below current market price or it's

1077
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,220
going down for sell stops I do not care

1078
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,960
this is no disrespect to anybody else

1079
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,180
out there that teaches and made money I

1080
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,339
don't give a flip

1081
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,500
the markets don't go up and down because

1082
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,599
your indicator said so the market

1083
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,940
doesn't go up and down because there's

1084
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,560
momentum of buying and selling pressure

1085
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,599
that's not what that is not what is

1086
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,000
going on here okay it's never been that

1087
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,280
way but we have been LED down the

1088
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,839
Primrose Lane with books authors

1089
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,460
teachers whatever

1090
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,960
saying that it's buying and selling

1091
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,680
pressure

1092
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,760
it's not

1093
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,099
these markets are absolutely controlled

1094
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,700
period

1095
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,320
if we can see

1096
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,720
the likelihood of PA wanting

1097
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,720
to at least get up to this level here

1098
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,160
why did I use that fair value yet

1099
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,800
remember I'm painting why I said this

1100
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,240
was something important why did I pick

1101
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,160
that Weekly fair value you got and why

1102
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,540
did I want to see it trade through it

1103
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,420
and become support because it's at a

1104
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,599
level that on a simple run of the daily

1105
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,780
chart using this dealing range this low

1106
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,180
to that high remember I had to fit back

1107
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,020
to it

1108
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,700
folks this is real learning this is the

1109
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,079
point okay the point is you want to know

1110
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,339
what you're doing if you want to go out

1111
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:54,540
there and gamble your money go watch

1112
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,180
somebody else okay you're you're welcome

1113
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,579
to do that but if you want to learn and

1114
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,900
you want to learn correctly and you're

1115
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,160
at the right place

1116
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,420
that FIB at 50 is halfway or equilibrium

1117
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,560
relative to this high

1118
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,700
in this low

1119
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,940
so if I'm waiting to see price to try to

1120
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,160
gravitate to here

1121
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,380
I want to see does it perform what I

1122
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,500
would really rather see happen I don't

1123
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,119
want to see it go up there and then

1124
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,800
sharply break lower because if it does

1125
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,599
that then I got to drop down to a lower

1126
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,099
time frame and look for a FVG

1127
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,780
or something else on a short-term

1128
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,480
premium to sell short pieces that would

1129
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,040
likely run into these relative equal

1130
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,000
lows but my experience in 30 years told

1131
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,140
me

1132
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,420
it told me that all the factors that's

1133
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,880
going on right now in the world

1134
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,599
geopolitically

1135
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,420
you know all the turmoil all the things

1136
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,940
that's going on the economy all that

1137
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,420
stuff is it calls for uncertainty

1138
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,260
and because of that I want to see yes my

1139
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,760
PD array is going to be a draw on

1140
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,140
liquidity it's going to draw up to that

1141
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,839
Weekly fair value guy but I already

1142
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,520
already announced to you that I'm going

1143
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,859
to see this do something other than just

1144
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,660
go up into it and treat it as an area to

1145
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,220
sell sore from I want to see it go

1146
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,260
through it does it do so yeah look where

1147
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,460
it closed

1148
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,640
above it I did this stuff real time in

1149
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,300
live streams where I taught you how to

1150
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,240
discard or disqualify a fair value guy

1151
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,180
so that way it looks like cherry picking

1152
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,280
because I'm showing you examples and a

1153
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,540
lot of people that hate me are trolls

1154
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,819
and people can't keep up with me

1155
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,800
they'll insist that it's cherry-picked

1156
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,599
but they have they don't know the logic

1157
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,040
and if they would just simply like

1158
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,020
listen to me now I'm telling you what

1159
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,980
I'm doing

1160
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,420
so that way you can go back and look at

1161
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,760
the things I've shared say oh oh yeah

1162
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,220
there is there it is right I'm not

1163
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,839
pulling things out of thin air I'm

1164
00:44:48,839 --> 00:46:10,359
pulling it from 30 years of experience I author these things 
so I'm sharing that language so that way you can learn how to do it so this FVG was the initial DOL
when we shifted Above This High here
that candle right there that runs above
that short-term High
that's a shift in Market structure now
Market is in a buy program 
a buy program is 
is now when you start looking for premium arrays 
where do you look for those premium arrays? 
well what is the dealing range 
that is this high to that low 
we're only interested in premium
so we don't look at this short term High as a turtle soup run above and go dollar
we don't look at this High here as I run above that internal suit and go short lower 
no we're looking for the first first equilibrium or higher PD array
we started on a HTF 
you want to you want to do a top-down analysis 
because large institutions, big funds are going to be using HTF charts

1192
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,200
so we're going to cannibalize

1193
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,960
their long-term models their long-term

1194
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,980
model

1195
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,099
through here was bearish

1196
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,900
so we're looking inside the scope of

1197
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,260
this High to that low right there

1198
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,780
midpoint is here

1199
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,839
that shaded area in Orange I'm assuming

1200
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,180
it's a hue of orange but that shaded

1201
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,560
area that's the weekly inversion fair

1202
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,960
value that's the first level of my

1203
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,040
interest

1204
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,180
okay

1205
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,920
so this specific weekly point of

1206
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,859
Interest I gave you the context as to

1207
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,660
what I want to see with it it wants to

1208
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,160
go higher great

1209
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,740
I need to see something specific I want

1210
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,300
to see it trade to it and through it

1211
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,640
we've seen it close right there

1212
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:12,300
if a market closes above a FVG that you think should be bearish
that's not a good shorting opportunity
many times it's communicating to you that it will become an inversion FVG

1218
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,900
oh there you go the penny just dropped I

1219
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,760
just gave you something again but if

1220
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,079
you're not listening

1221
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,119
okay if you're not you're trying to

1222
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,740
filter out the buy and sell signals then

1223
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,839
you you think I'm teaching you in Morse

1224
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:25,859
code

1225
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,980
I'm teaching you specifics in detail I'm

1226
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,140
this is the point you want to be trading

1227
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,880
with Precision you want to read the

1228
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,319
charts without me and nobody else

1229
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,240
helping you it'd be independently

1230
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,720
wealthy all these things have to have a

1231
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,000
lot of understanding and logic so that

1232
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,400
way you know you can trust it it's not

1233
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,800
changing and morphing all the time the

1234
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,240
rules aren't changing the goal post is

1235
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,339
not being moved you know that these

1236
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,680
logic or this logic

1237
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,900
is sound you've seen it many times

1238
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,339
before and you can trust it so that way

1239
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:57,599
when you go forward and you're in

1240
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
forward testing and then before

1241
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,339
a combine challenge or if you're trading

1242
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,619
with your own account

1243
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,359
you'll trust it

1244
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,240
you won't be nervous it's the same type

1245
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,700
of thing like when you go to work you

1246
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,900
know the different routes that you can

1247
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,040
take to get to work

1248
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,380
is the map changing sometimes there's a

1249
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,700
detour that's required there's

1250
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,440
construction well guess what sometimes

1251
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,880
the market will do a little hiccup and

1252
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,640
and you didn't see a specific time frame

1253
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,619
do something and it might stop you out

1254
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,579
okay recalibrate like a GPS

1255
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,920
yeah what's that what does it do it

1256
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,800
reroutes you as long as this objective

1257
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,720
of the weekly order block which was the

1258
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,579
draw in liquidity

1259
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,319
this was the

1260
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,119
multiplier

1261
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,640
the inversion pair value got

1262
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,800
so I wanted to see does it get to and

1263
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,020
through it yes does it treat it as

1264
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,880
support in the LTFs it does

1265
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,359
and then trades out to that Weekly order

1266
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,780
block daily order block and the last

1267
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,300
level you heard about was we want to see

1268
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,160
if it wants to get up to that 104.54

1269
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,780
which is the weekly

1270
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,579
bearish order block mean threshold

1271
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,280
now that's a lot of stuff

1272
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,339
there's no way I could say that in less

1273
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,160
time and teach you what I just talked

1274
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,900
about what was going through my mind why

1275
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,280
did I talk about that level right there

1276
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,560
that's the shortest absolute shortest

1277
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,380
way around getting between point a and

1278
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,900
point B to the point that was the logic

1279
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,099
that I used

1280
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,780
think about how you could have said it

1281
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,220
with less words

1282
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,060
and make it make sense you can't so stop

1283
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,579
okay stop expecting something to be

1284
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,400
condensed when this is condensed

1285
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,319
but it's specific so that way you

1286
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,300
understand the match behind it so let's

1287
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,780
go into

1288
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,460
grading a price swing

1289
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,440
so we have these levels here the first

1290
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,640
one I drew your attention to was that

1291
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,859
Weekly worldwide now

1292
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,839
I could have very easily laid all these

1293
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,640
out here

1294
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,800
in advance and said watch all three of

1295
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,880
these get hit

1296
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,740
but you're learning

1297
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,020
your understanding is a graduated

1298
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,020
experience and

1299
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,760
charter members could go right into this

1300
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,380
and see it right away you know people

1301
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,700
have been with me for a very very long

1302
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,540
time

1303
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,359
if you're new or relatively new

1304
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:21,300
if I lay this level here

1305
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,960
and what I'm about to say is not to be

1306
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,300
construed as talking down to individuals

1307
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,339
okay I'm just reminding you where you're

1308
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,440
making the mistakes you are I'm not

1309
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,060
making the mistakes I'm telling you to

1310
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,319
be careful

1311
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,760
but if I say I like this level here

1312
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,920
and you foolishly go out there and you

1313
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,140
try to trade with your money or risk

1314
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,240
your funded account on it or try to do a

1315
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,859
combine challenge

1316
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,020
and insist because ICT said it's going

1317
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,540
to go up here between this point here

1318
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,280
and this point down here

1319
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,579
there's lots of room for air

1320
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,440
if you don't have a lot of experience or

1321
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,400
don't know what you don't or you're

1322
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,599
impulsive

1323
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,720
and you chase price even if you do use a

1324
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,819
stop loss you'll get caught up in these

1325
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:07,260
retracements that you won't expect or

1326
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,339
anticipate

1327
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,140
and you'll walk away thinking this stuff

1328
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,520
doesn't work

1329
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,020
and then now here we are it goes right

1330
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,059
to the levels that I've talked about so

1331
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:17,280
between these two price points with this

1332
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,160
shift in Market structure here

1333
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,380
running up into that Weekly bearish

1334
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,900
order block mean threshold again this

1335
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,880
level here

1336
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,380
right there let me take the FIB off

1337
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,880
because there's more lines on there that

1338
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,800
I want to show you

1339
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,040
that level here is not anything in this

1340
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,040
fractal of any importance it's the

1341
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,800
weekly chart

1342
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,700
it's this one here

1343
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,599
the mean threshold this is the halfway

1344
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,180
point of this candle and that's done by

1345
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,400
like this you take the FIB

1346
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
drop it on the low to the high bam right

1347
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,640
there 104.540

1348
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,040
that's why that level's there it's half

1349
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,400
of that

1350
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,920
now let's drop back down into the daily

1351
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,319
so we had a market structure shift here

1352
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,559
and right away we have this fair value

1353
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,880
guy

1354
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,160
now watch folks this is not quarters

1355
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,480
Theory okay because you're going to hear

1356
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,500
somebody come out and say oh he's

1357
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,119
teaching Quarters here I was doing this

1358
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,400
stuff before quarter stories we'll even

1359
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,720
talk about

1360
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,599
this this is what grading a price swing

1361
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,359
allows you you have to know what where's

1362
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,980
the DOL

1363
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,940
where is the terminus the end of the

1364
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,319
line where do you think price is going

1365
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,819
to go it doesn't mean that's where it

1366
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,040
stops ultimately in reverses where do

1367
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,200
you see your setup form where's the

1368
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,500
framework where is the dealing range

1369
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,119
that you're going to work within that

1370
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,859
dealing range is

1371
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:56,640
always in the past high to low we frame

1372
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,559
the equilibrium price point here and

1373
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,540
we're aiming for a premium why do we

1374
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,559
want to see that because we want to see

1375
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:03,300
it trade into this FVG and

1376
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,180
above it which would nullify it would

1377
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,480
remove any need to anticipate lower

1378
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,099
prices on dollar

1379
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,500
it's signaling to you algorithmically

1380
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,200
that it is not going to go lower it in

1381
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,660
fact wants to go higher

1382
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,579
so if we can do that

1383
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,140
and we see it does it closes here

1384
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,380
that really increases the opportunity

1385
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,079
for this FVG to be inversion

1386
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,000
for Vega that means it's going to act as

1387
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,020
a

1388
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,660
resistance broken turn support to use

1389
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,180
retail minded logic but this would never

1390
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,280
be construed as that because it doesn't

1391
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,020
fit any of the type of thing that you

1392
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,099
would expect with retail support

1393
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,300
resistance

1394
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,339
nor does it meet the criteria for

1395
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,980
supplying demand

1396
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,780
before

1397
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,660
you go out there and you wreck yourself

1398
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,220
in your live trading or whatever it's

1399
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,780
important to know these types of rules

1400
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,440
because if you are slow in making money

1401
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,780
and fast in trying to preserve or keep

1402
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,780
it those two

1403
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,480
modes of thought or

1404
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,960
conducting you know a daily routine move

1405
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
very very slow when you're trying to

1406
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,440
make money because there's lots of

1407
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,599
opportunities to do that every single

1408
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:19,619
day there is

1409
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,420
every single week every single day every

1410
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,280
single session there's something that

1411
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,020
you can capitalize on

1412
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,059
every single day

1413
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,740
and in fact

1414
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,380
specific hours of the day

1415
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,780
you can trade one hour candles

1416
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,000
and treat it just like this whole idea

1417
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,559
that I've shown here on the basis of

1418
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:39,599
that Weekly Candlestick all this stuff

1419
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,700
is applicable inside of a 60 Minute

1420
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,839
candle

1421
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,880
it all exists there

1422
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,300
it's a it's a tiny little you Universe

1423
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,579
within that one time frame

1424
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,500
you can break these things down smaller

1425
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,400
and smaller and smaller

1426
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,480
but you don't have the experience yet

1427
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,800
and you have to give yourself the time

1428
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,200
to acquire that experience and once you

1429
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,900
have it then it gives you confidence and

1430
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,579
you got to be very very careful once you

1431
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:06,660
get that confidence if you know what

1432
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,400
you're doing it doesn't evolve into

1433
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,980
egomaniac

1434
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,880
attention okay I was always that

1435
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,520
when I was in 20. in my 20s I this kind

1436
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,040
of stuff made me feel Superior to

1437
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,220
everybody and I communicated that always

1438
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,500
and I don't even know my stuff is

1439
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,980
superior I don't view myself in a manner

1440
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,319
where I have to go out there and stay

1441
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,940
and prove it I don't have to do that

1442
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,660
anymore

1443
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,099
I have students now that are doing it

1444
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,500
this price range

1445
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,700
okay

1446
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,220
that I'm looking forward to if we get

1447
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,960
this shift in Market Circle I'm sorry

1448
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,880
shift in Market structure here on this

1449
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,260
candle here

1450
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,420
that that moment we have entered a buy

1451
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,500
program

1452
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,720
so we have to go back into this range

1453
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,880
and anchor it to

1454
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,300
where we anticipate price going

1455
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,400
that DOL the initial one

1456
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,380
was here

1457
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,380
this one I I don't believe I mentioned

1458
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,220
it

1459
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,680
but I'm gonna say I didn't but you can

1460
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,420
see clearly it's anchored on the daily

1461
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,160
chart but I did tell you this one here

1462
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,359
this is where we want to see if it wants

1463
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:19,800
to get up into that

1464
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,200
so all of this run here

1465
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,020
we could be sitting still anticipating

1466
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,300
not reacting anticipating a run above

1467
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,460
that short-term High here why am I

1468
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,859
talking about this high man he finally

1469
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,480
talked about it he's finally saying it

1470
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,980
I've been screaming at this monitor

1471
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,839
Michael why are you wanting this High

1472
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,880
why don't you use this High why don't

1473
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,540
you use that high why not that high

1474
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,200
low lower low lower low

1475
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,819
okay

1476
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:51,599
we consolidate all through April and May

1477
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,599
I'm Audi see ya I want the market to

1478
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,280
show me something

1479
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,559
so when I was down in Florida when I was

1480
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,940
cruising around in my RV and I don't

1481
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,859
live in an RV

1482
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:03,420
Cooper

1483
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,460
I want to see it move out of this range

1484
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,839
okay

1485
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,720
let's just for a moment let's ring in

1486
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,880
the bond market okay if you are on

1487
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,940
Twitter I believe it was Twitter

1488
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,700
if it wasn't Twitter

1489
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,119
either I did a video short little video

1490
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:23,819
commentary on Twitter or it was

1491
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,800
mentioned somewhere in my commentary on

1492
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,119
the YouTube channel but I know I talked

1493
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,079
about it

1494
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,000
and you'll see the chart right away and

1495
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,640
remember those that have watched it

1496
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,400
but during this consolidation in here I

1497
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,720
want to see it

1498
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,780
perform a specific way I want to see it

1499
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,440
show me something all through here I

1500
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,319
wanted to see the dollar go lower I

1501
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,480
expected it to take out that low

1502
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,180
but because it was showing unwillingness

1503
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,000
to perform or show any willingness to go

1504
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,380
lower

1505
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,780
how did I how do I get to the point

1506
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,640
where I didn't trust it

1507
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,160
talk about how when we don't want to

1508
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,540
take a trade when there's something in

1509
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,280
the PA that says don't do

1510
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,700
anything okay let's do that right now

1511
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,059
here we have this love right there

1512
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,280
see that little Pierce below it right

1513
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,280
there a little tiny little short move

1514
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,900
below that low

1515
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,500
right there

1516
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,500
it can and it could have very easily

1517
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,420
traded back up to this level and then

1518
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,619
resumed

1519
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,180
if it would have done that then a dollar

1520
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,559
really would have embarrassed longer

1521
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:32,280
term

1522
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,619
but because it consolidated

1523
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,440
I want to see does it

1524
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,960
have confirmation through the bond

1525
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,579
market

1526
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:43,260
all this consolidation is going to be

1527
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,000
shown in the bond market I want to go to

1528
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,640
the daily chart for

1529
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,960
zbm2023 which is a symbol that's used

1530
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,700
for bonds

1531
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,579
uh it's not the month that you should be

1532
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,400
trading or tracking it now uh its volume

1533
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,640
has rotated into the September contract

1534
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,020
but I'll I'll show you what I mean in a

1535
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,760
second

1536
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,880
to understand how the dollar is likely

1537
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,020
to perform

1538
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,000
I use the bond market

1539
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,040
okay and right away some of you that

1540
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,960
just want to have one market you want it

1541
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,359
to be real simple and short and sweet

1542
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:17,160
this is where most of you drop off

1543
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,020
because you know you're like oh this is

1544
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,480
complicated that's how you feel folks

1545
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,140
don't watch my videos okay I promise you

1546
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,520
you'll do something

1547
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,079
either be successful at what you're

1548
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,520
doing or you'll hurt yourself and you'll

1549
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,720
come back here and you'll learn how the

1550
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,400
markets really work but this

1551
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,200
consolidation in here

1552
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,619
I want to see does it perform

1553
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,359
in a mirror image of what the bond

1554
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,339
market is doing the bond market

1555
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:46,500
zbm2023 was in a Range okay and I want

1556
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,260
to see it go down into a discount if the

1557
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,819
buy Market goes down on a discount that

1558
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:53,339
would result in the dollar Index moving

1559
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,859
into a premium

1560
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,900
here's that range

1561
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,880
okay we were in this range and until

1562
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,760
this range was given up until it left

1563
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,720
this range dollar wasn't doing anything

1564
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,119
equities we're going to range mount

1565
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,660
that's why I stayed out taking RV road

1566
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,500
trips

1567
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,240
I don't care about the PA when

1568
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,220
it's in here like this can I trade that

1569
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,339
absolutely can you trade it absolutely

1570
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:23,339
but to meet a expectation in the

1571
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,920
community that's been craving higher

1572
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,200
time frame charts swing trading ideas

1573
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,240
can you do something off the women in

1574
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,740
charts I don't know why he's always

1575
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,000
talking about the one minute charts the

1576
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,680
answer the reason why is because it

1577
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,839
gives me lots of teaching examples where

1578
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,280
I can call it before it happens and it

1579
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,520
pans out precisely and that is where you

1580
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,020
should study

1581
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,420
whether you trade them or not you should

1582
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,859
study those LTFs because

1583
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:50,220
you're getting so much experience by

1584
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,500
using LTF charts because

1585
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,720
it's not noise like the Goldman Sachs

1586
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,220
boys will tell you

1587
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,040
there's absolutely a rhyming reason why

1588
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,900
prices listen

1589
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,819
is it a different price

1590
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:05,099
okay is it a different price if you're

1591
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:09,420
looking at the bond market Bitcoin

1592
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,260
um

1593
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,420
gold whatever it is whatever asset

1594
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,660
you're looking at is price booking at a

1595
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,280
market price differently

1596
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,500
if you're looking at it on a daily chart

1597
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,079
or a one minute chart

1598
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,579
if you were looking at right now if

1599
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,780
you're looking at the bond market right

1600
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,920
here

1601
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,440
this is this is live

1602
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,540
it's not delayed data

1603
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,900
right now the price is showing at 127

1604
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,780
and 12 30 seconds

1605
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,760
that's what it's showing right now if I

1606
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,460
drop down into a one minute chart

1607
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,960
look at that

1608
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,619
holy crow it's the same price

1609
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,960
so don't listen to these goobers that'll

1610
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,359
tell you you know there's noise on the

1611
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,280
LTFs you're looking at the

1612
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,480
same price

1613
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,880
price is doing the same thing

1614
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,520
in all time frames but the narrative as

1615
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,040
to what it's going to do next hello

1616
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,900
is going to be derived from what time

1617
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,900
frame you're using right now

1618
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,160
in layman's terms I'll say it like this

1619
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,700
it's going to behave in a manner that

1620
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,579
the HTF outlines this is

1621
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,559
right now this is PA

1622
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,780
on the June contract for bonds as you

1623
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,660
can see it's real spotty okay if you use

1624
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,000
ZB I'll come back to the daily chart in

1625
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,040
a second I just want to make a point

1626
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,780
okay that's the symbol that's being

1627
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,119
shown right here

1628
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:35,220
zbm2023 the m is the Futures Contract

1629
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,059
month

1630
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:40,140
code for June all the volume

1631
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,839
is rotated into now the September

1632
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:45,079
contract so that is going to be the U

1633
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,819
symbol watch how all these little dots

1634
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,980
become much more

1635
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,799
smoother see that that tells you

1636
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,140
that all the volume and open interest is

1637
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,420
now rotated early

1638
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,420
in the bond market s p

1639
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,940
the June contract is still favored but

1640
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,059
it will be changing here shortly

1641
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:07,380
now let's go back out to a daily chart

1642
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,579
for bonds and I'll tell you what I was

1643
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,559
doing and what I was thinking

1644
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,839
and I gotta go to the June contract

1645
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:14,339
because that's what was being traded in

1646
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:16,680
April and May

1647
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,960
okay so here is the business on the

1648
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,480
bonds we're in this range I wanted to

1649
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,579
see this break that range

1650
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:26,520
oh he's a breakout artist I knew it ICT

1651
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,200
is a breakout artist he's a break and

1652
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,380
retest guy no not

1653
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,540
no I'm not I want to see it leave this

1654
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,480
this is Market profile notice there is

1655
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,480
no volume bars to the right of my chart

1656
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,420
okay I I don't use that stuff that to me

1657
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,799
is Mickey Mouse stuff if you make money

1658
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:46,559
with it God bless you okay God bless you

1659
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,599
run with that idea that's not what makes

1660
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,760
markets go up and down though

1661
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,420
market profiles to me is a schematic

1662
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,680
it's a a behavior a graph now if you go

1663
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,020
into my core content on my YouTube

1664
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,520
channel which was premium content people

1665
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,140
had paid money for that

1666
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,359
those lessons are the language that my

1667
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,400
students had to understand when I was

1668
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,240
doing you know live educations and

1669
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,920
Analysis every day every single day I

1670
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,160
was doing analysis and I was on the spot

1671
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,480
every single day

1672
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,520
calling every single day what it should

1673
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,040
perform where was this bad this mad rush

1674
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,599
of people coming out and saying ICT is a

1675
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,400
fraud he can't do this stuff I'm paying

1676
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,020
him he didn't call that right it never

1677
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,059
happened

1678
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:31,740
if anybody's gonna expose me it would

1679
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,440
have been those individuals that paid me

1680
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,020
you're seeing the testimony again it's

1681
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,299
happening in front of you I'm teaching

1682
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:40,500
you the logic

1683
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,880
you're getting it right from the source

1684
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,140
I needed this range here to leave

1685
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,579
I didn't care if it was going to go

1686
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,280
higher or lower because I didn't know at

1687
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,960
the time which one to trust because

1688
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,720
remember on The Daily dollar Index I

1689
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,460
wanted to see that low taken out that's

1690
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,440
what I wanted but I had to submit myself

1691
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,359
to what price was showing me it was not

1692
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:02,640
willing to go there yet so I had to take

1693
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,960
a step back and wait

1694
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,400
wait a minute man you're supposed to be

1695
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,500
I have 30 years experience right that 30

1696
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,599
years experience gave me the insights to

1697
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,059
say sit still bro

1698
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:14,520
sit down this dance ain't for you sit

1699
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,799
down wait

1700
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,960
let the elephant enter that swimming

1701
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,000
pool think about a children's swimming

1702
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,559
pool okay A little tiny little swimming

1703
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,319
pool if they swimming pool the size of a

1704
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,000
child use

1705
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,859
if you filled it up with water and an

1706
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,420
elephant came over and sat down in it

1707
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,160
what would happen to the water

1708
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,319
it would be displaced right it would it

1709
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,760
would leave the pool

1710
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,640
being replaced with the the mass of that

1711
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,220
elephant smart money

1712
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,780
is like that

1713
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,180
in this range here

1714
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,359
right here when we saw it close right

1715
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:50,400
there outside that range

1716
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,799
that sets the stage for

1717
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,960
up move in dollar

1718
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,059
but I have to wait I have to wait for

1719
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,640
something this is Wednesday May 17th

1720
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,880
let's go back over to the dollar Index

1721
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,500
I know I should have I should have

1722
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,180
charged you money for this

1723
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:11,099
all right so here is May 17 3 there

1724
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:12,780
okay

1725
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,299
lo and behold that's the day that the

1726
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:18,059
dollar Index is trading inside of its

1727
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:22,020
FVG right there after post

1728
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,819
the shift in Market structure so this

1729
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,460
High broke to the upside how can we

1730
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,839
qualify that as a shift in Market

1731
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,160
structure for the dollar to keep going

1732
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,500
higher I just taught you are we seeing a

1733
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,839
mirror image that would constitute a

1734
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,599
expectation for the bond market to enter

1735
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:38,880
a sell program it means bonds going down

1736
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,260
dollar going up

1737
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,700
we're in a consolidation we're in

1738
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,940
uncertainty here so I have to wait when

1739
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,039
this happened okay all focus goes to the

1740
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,299
sphere Vega

1741
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,579
but now I don't want to see it go up

1742
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:56,280
here to go short why

1743
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,420
all this stuff that's happening in

1744
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,799
the other side of the world I'm trying

1745
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:03,420
not to use words that'll flag my channel

1746
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,940
because I've had friends that are not

1747
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,780
even

1748
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,960
you know technical traders or dealing

1749
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,400
with the markets and they talked about

1750
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,319
these topics and they they lose their

1751
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,020
channel so I'm not going there

1752
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,900
but just think geopolitical

1753
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,780
w-a-r all those things all that

1754
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,280
uncertainty the debt ceiling the

1755
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,380
potential default all that stuff was a

1756
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,180
catalyst

1757
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,359
from a macro perspective

1758
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,880
which is why I didn't believe that that

1759
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,440
FVG would be a short now if

1760
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,460
it would have went up there and started

1761
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,599
to sell off like I said I would use a

1762
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,460
LTF four hour one hour

1763
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,359
chart

1764
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,700
short of you know a premium like that

1765
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,200
and get in sync and then run for these

1766
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,599
lows here but the context that I went

1767
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,039
into and I shared with you was I wanted

1768
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,020
to see that Weekly FVG trade

1769
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,000
above it and come down and treat it as

1770
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,640
support look this is the daily chart for

1771
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,420
the dollar Index look where the bodies

1772
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,280
on the lower end of that Gap look where

1773
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,799
the bodies were

1774
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:04,859
was that not respecting that Weekly Gap

1775
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:07,260
that's not supplying demand that's not

1776
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,420
support resistance this is algorithmic

1777
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,579
It's referring back to a level I drew

1778
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:14,160
your attention to beforehand

1779
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,920
now how can I do that I'm not a time

1780
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,219
traveler

1781
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,719
there's logic there that means there's

1782
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:23,960
something going on in price delivery

1783
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,759
that is well beyond buy and selling

1784
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:29,160
pressure it's rigged

1785
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,899
and there shouldn't be any reason for

1786
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,120
you to be upset about that it shouldn't

1787
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,880
scare you you should be thankful

1788
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,100
you should be thankful that they rigged

1789
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,080
these markets because that presents the

1790
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,880
opportunity that as long as you're in

1791
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,580
sync with what it's likely to do next

1792
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,319
well guess what

1793
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,080
there's a 90 likelihood that new Traders

1794
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,479
will lose their money in the first 90

1795
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,799
days or less

1796
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,460
that's a statistic but on the other side

1797
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,920
of their trades there are people

1798
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,660
with lots of experience that know what

1799
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,698
they're doing they're the winner of

1800
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:04,560
those losing trades that the losing

1801
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,120
crowd loses to

1802
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,560
there's a buyer and seller for every

1803
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,319
trade it's a net sum zero game but the

1804
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,359
game is rigged

1805
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,859
there's no reason for you to be mad

1806
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,020
about it start punching the air that's

1807
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,759
the reason why that broker did it to me

1808
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,198
the broker didn't do anything to you

1809
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,238
unless you're trading Forex because they

1810
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:23,160
they have individual liquidity pools

1811
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,339
when you're trading futures

1812
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:28,859
you're all getting the same price

1813
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,620
that's the that's the it's a gentleman's

1814
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,520
Market okay if you want to be a Savage

1815
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,620
you trade Forex and when it's wild it

1816
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,420
moves around that's why I left Futures

1817
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,479
because you know in the 2000s it was why

1818
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,939
we have really big wide price ranges and

1819
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:48,660
300 range days on the on the regular

1820
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,580
well that dried up

1821
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,020
and the market started getting real

1822
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,600
Consolidated so I went back to what I

1823
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,000
started with which is index futures

1824
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,060
I don't care if the s p trades with a

1825
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,340
five handle day

1826
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,739
and I said that correctly I don't care

1827
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:08,520
if the s p traded a five handle day

1828
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,560
folks that's exactly what we were

1829
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,560
looking at in the 90s

1830
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,480
that that type of stuff in the in the

1831
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,179
early 80s and such those days that was

1832
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:19,260
like the normal

1833
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,699
you didn't have this wild crazy

1834
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:23,460
volatility it's great don't get me wrong

1835
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,940
but if things got so slow and down to a

1836
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,800
snails crawl in Pace

1837
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,300
that's okay

1838
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,580
you can still do all those things and

1839
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,800
there's very small little ranges it'll

1840
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,659
just look like

1841
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:38,460
what the charts look like now but the

1842
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,080
amount of movement will be much much

1843
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,179
more

1844
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:42,780
condensed

1845
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,400
and a lot of you aren't even prepared to

1846
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,840
trade in a market like that because

1847
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,060
you're so used and you're baptized in

1848
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,340
all this High volatility

1849
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,400
when Forex shrank up

1850
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,400
and all the pairs had smaller ranges

1851
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,620
social media it was constant bellyaching

1852
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,840
oh man when's the big days coming

1853
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,600
Wednesday but it's moving folks if you

1854
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,120
can get 10 handles or 10 Pips from a

1855
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,860
price swing that's good

1856
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,199
what's wrong with that what's wrong with

1857
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,780
if if you just got five Pips

1858
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,340
who cares that the range is really small

1859
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,320
but you have to have your expectation

1860
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,480
calibrated to what the market profile is

1861
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,219
right now that means we're in

1862
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,280
consolidation I need to see what I need

1863
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,500
to see bonds leave because bonds will

1864
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,659
qualify whatever the dollar is going to

1865
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,540
do I'm gonna do a mirror image of it

1866
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,300
so bonds broke lower

1867
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,820
that means this is qualified as a break

1868
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,560
in Market structure and it shifted

1869
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,699
higher

1870
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:41,340
fair value guy right there let's play

1871
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,260
Devil's Advocate and say for a moment

1872
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,520
because this is a daily chart and this

1873
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,920
is the dollar Index by the way so if

1874
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,540
you're a Forex Trader this is the gold

1875
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,880
mine that you want to be in okay this is

1876
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,140
where you want to be mining these things

1877
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,820
from ICT the things that you think is

1878
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,320
boring other people say it's

1879
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,600
this is the stuff that makes you wealthy

1880
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,159
this is the stuff that finds constant

1881
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:01,199
consistency and continuity in trading

1882
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,640
longevity you want to be around for a

1883
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,640
little while longer than a couple months

1884
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,159
hopefully

1885
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,260
it's this Insight this is the stuff that

1886
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,739
gets you there

1887
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,060
let's say that you saw this happen after

1888
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,800
the fact you were working you were

1889
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,480
sleeping you have a business you're

1890
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,860
running

1891
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,060
just couldn't be in front of the charts

1892
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,580
and you saw afterwards the day closes

1893
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,900
like this

1894
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,600
the very next day folks

1895
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,400
the very next day what do you think the

1896
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,260
bias should be for your analysis

1897
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,880
bullish

1898
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,820
reaching for what that fair value guy so

1899
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,179
between

1900
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:40,440
the 17th

1901
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,940
of May

1902
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,219
until we got to the first objective

1903
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:46,500
which is that Weekly order block here on

1904
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,960
this debt here so from the 17th of May

1905
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,000
to the 24th of May

1906
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,280
that run

1907
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,560
here

1908
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,060
to here

1909
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,340
that right there is a sell program in

1910
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:02,460
Euro that means selling short that means

1911
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,960
every day you're going in with a bias to

1912
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,540
go long in Euro it's also a bias to go

1913
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,780
long in pound dollar it's also a long or

1914
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,760
buy program for Aussie dollar it's also

1915
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,440
a long for New Zealand versus the US

1916
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,840
dollar it is a short

1917
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,900
oh

1918
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,719
I just said that wrong you like that I

1919
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,040
made a mistake there this is where I

1920
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,560
wish I could go I can edit it

1921
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,480
the Dollar's going higher so it's a

1922
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,480
short in euro dollar short in pound

1923
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,400
dollar short and Aussie dollar short in

1924
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,020
New Zealand dollar because the dollar

1925
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,080
going higher okay it would be a long in

1926
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,659
dollar yen

1927
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:45,239
it would be a long in dollar Swiss okay

1928
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:46,380
because we're looking at this is the

1929
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,580
dollar Index so if it's going higher

1930
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,219
that range between here

1931
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:55,560
by this date it's after the fair buy you

1932
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,460
got right here let me put it in the

1933
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,640
chart

1934
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,460
yes my obsessive compulsive is flaring

1935
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,500
right now

1936
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,199
I'm sorry it just shows you I'm not AI

1937
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,780
I'm a mistake all right let's see extend

1938
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,520
right take that off

1939
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,080
okay so there's your favorite Gap so

1940
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,900
after that forms the next day here until

1941
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,300
it gets to your premium array where's

1942
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,340
the DOL

1943
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,699
weekly order block what's the multiplier

1944
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,460
if you're a swing Trader

1945
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,800
it needs to find support here so that

1946
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,199
sets the stage for your swing trade but

1947
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,360
as a day trader you don't need that

1948
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,300
you're in there before that which is why

1949
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,480
I don't do swing trades I'm using the

1950
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,300
information I'm showing you here between

1951
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,100
this here the very next day and I

1952
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,239
apologize if you hear my stomach because

1953
01:14:45,239 --> 01:15:10,460
I'm fasting right now the idea of
expecting higher prices on dollar Index
every day until it gets this objective
first here that sets the tone for a bias
that gives you your bias because that
bias is derived from the narrative
that's being shown with HTF weekly and daily charts 
also inter-market relationships the bond market versus the dollar Index 
and Market profiling 

1964
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,800
so we are in a consolidation we have a shift in Market

1965
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,960
structure how do we qualify that

1966
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,060
the range that I told you the bonds were

1967
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,620
in I said why is the market

1968
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,239
consolidating go back and look at

1969
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:21,960
Twitter

1970
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,460
I tweeted it

1971
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,760
it's there the bonds are in a Range

1972
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,040
until the bonds leave that range all

1973
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,960
markets will be in consolidation

1974
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,699
because interest rates what makes the

1975
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,219
world go round

1976
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:37,980
and then after that that narrative is

1977
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,780
set

1978
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,120
then we can have a bias

1979
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,699
so the bias is bullish here for dollars

1980
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,640
bullish here it's even bullish on this

1981
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,560
day but not in the scheme that we would

1982
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,800
expect it to open and then buy it and go

1983
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,360
up we're in that range now that fair

1984
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,360
value Gap so what we would expect is to

1985
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,460
consolidate or retrace and does it

1986
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,380
support the low end of that range and

1987
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,360
look at the body showing you that that's

1988
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,360
a signature that's algorithmic so

1989
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,400
as a swing Trader

1990
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,140
you could use this day here as an entry

1991
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,420
and then pyramid in here

1992
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,219
for a run into that

1993
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,860
using that implied dealing range an

1994
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,540
implied dealing range

1995
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,640
is not a dealing range like this whereas

1996
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,020
we have a real

1997
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:28,199
High and a real low those are actual

1998
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:30,420
we're looking for a price run from this

1999
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,540
low up to this order block on the weekly

2000
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,679
chart

2001
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,020
until it does that that's an implied

2002
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,580
dealing range we don't know if it's

2003
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,739
going there anything can happen a bomb

2004
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,719
could drop somewhere you know oh you

2005
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,000
know some kind of a hack that hits the

2006
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,400
markets I expect that's going to be used

2007
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,860
in the future by the way but that run

2008
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,500
here that is a implied dealing range it

2009
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,320
has not really manifest yet but we're

2010
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,060
seeing

2011
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,640
with anticipation that that's where the

2012
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,260
draw in liquidity is the initial one was

2013
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,640
here so now let's go and add our fib

2014
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,980
to this low I know this stuff is amazing

2015
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,659
and I could talk about this stuff all

2016
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,400
day long

2017
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,780
all right so

2018
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,239
right there

2019
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:18,179
from this low

2020
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:19,739
to that high

2021
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:21,719
which is the weekly order block what I'm

2022
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,580
showing you there is the range okay it's

2023
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,699
an implied dealing range

2024
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:28,920
if we have that

2025
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,380
look at the levels I have here

2026
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,120
75

2027
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,360
50 which is equilibrium and 25 and then

2028
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,100
here's the high the high of the run

2029
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,960
which is Terminus at the end of the run

2030
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,040
if you're going to use this as you're

2031
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,260
dealing not not the only range if you're

2032
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,659
implied dealing range it's where you

2033
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:47,820
think it's going to go so before the

2034
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,460
candlesticks even form

2035
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,340
before they even form folks you could

2036
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,659
have this in your chart like this

2037
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,500
it would look like this right here

2038
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,900
okay say it's Meandering around like

2039
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,420
this in consolidation and you you start

2040
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,179
doing your analysis you think okay what

2041
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:19,140
happens if we were to break lower in the

2042
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,760
pound I'm sorry if we were to break

2043
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,920
lower in the bond market

2044
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,380
then that would give rise to the dollar

2045
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,860
Index

2046
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,080
hi

2047
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,360
low is your dealing range

2048
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,719
weekly FVG okay that sets the

2049
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,280
stage for if we're going to go higher

2050
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,580
I'd like to see us remove this bearish

2051
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,620
you know stance that I hold on dollar

2052
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,659
during this time period if it goes to

2053
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:47,820
here and goes above it and three says

2054
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,520
support I'm not bearish on dollar

2055
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,260
go back and listen to my reviews it's

2056
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,840
there I didn't it wasn't word salad it

2057
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,600
was very specific

2058
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,719
but because we have this range here

2059
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,060
we can take the low up to that Weekly

2060
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,480
order block

2061
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,920
let me take the FIB off and show you

2062
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,360
what you're doing this is what you could

2063
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,440
do here

2064
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,120
I know some of you are brand new or much

2065
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,260
it's the first time you've seen this oh

2066
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,520
this is hindsight

2067
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,140
go back and look at the reviews folks I

2068
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,100
was talking about all this stuff before

2069
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,900
it happened I didn't give you this much

2070
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,760
of a breakdown but I'm teaching you how

2071
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,620
to create a price swing how to

2072
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,260
anticipate where the next setups are

2073
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,420
going to form before they ever come into

2074
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,500
the chart

2075
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,540
forget supply and demand supply and

2076
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,060
demand requires the candlesticks or

2077
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,580
ranges to be in the chart I'm going to

2078
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:39,239
teach you where they will form before

2079
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:42,659
they will form where do setups form show

2080
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:44,640
me how to buy and sell Michael where are

2081
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,440
these PD arrays that work how does it

2082
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,239
look in the chart before it gets there

2083
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,040
what should I anticipate how do I how

2084
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,840
can I trust this though

2085
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,239
okay let's do some time travel

2086
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,140
low to high that's terminus we have 25

2087
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,400
percent

2088
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,780
50 and 75 of the range we require bonds

2089
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,580
to do one or the other go up or go down

2090
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,260
and leave that range I showed you on its

2091
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,159
daily chart

2092
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,219
it broke lower not yet

2093
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:13,560
but now we have a

2094
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,840
let go of that Michael good grief we

2095
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,159
have a shift in Market structure right

2096
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,840
there well in the bond market we

2097
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,659
qualified it with it going lower it left

2098
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:23,340
its range going lower

2099
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,960
that's going to give

2100
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,500
momentum to the upside on longs

2101
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,780
not that that's driving price but that's

2102
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,840
setting your mindset in motion for it

2103
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,000
we're in a buy program for dollar

2104
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,620
so

2105
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,620
right away we can anticipate somewhere

2106
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,840
in here in this area there's going to be

2107
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,640
some kind of accumulation

2108
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,760
we consolidate here and then we run

2109
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,480
what does that make that right there

2110
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,159
that's a fair bag out right

2111
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:54,960
yeah it's a fair value guy

2112
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,719
more specifically it's a breakaway Gap

2113
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,580
what is it breaking away from it's

2114
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,100
breaking away from this consolidation

2115
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,800
it has a shift in Market structure so

2116
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,880
this is your Gap to trade this is the

2117
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,739
gap that you use to qualify as a

2118
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,719
breakaway Gap and then trust it's likely

2119
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,040
going to draw here which is why I

2120
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,960
communicated to you I said we want to

2121
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,060
see this traded to but I'm more

2122
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,159
interested in trading it up above it and

2123
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,360
coming back down and finding it as

2124
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,340
support which makes it an inversion Fair

2125
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,260
Vega

2126
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,760
now

2127
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,420
I know if you're new this sounds like a

2128
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,980
whole lot of stuff please just give me

2129
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,540
an overbought oversold indicator and a

2130
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,060
moving average to follow that's okay

2131
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,860
you're not ready for me

2132
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,360
that that's all that it means it doesn't

2133
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,340
mean that you can't learn this it just

2134
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,920
means that you're not ready yet go watch

2135
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,239
somebody else there's lots of other

2136
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:46,560
people that'll Entertain You and tickle

2137
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,360
your ears you want to learn how to read

2138
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,860
the markets and really know what to do

2139
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,000
come back here

2140
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,440
50 equilibrium look where that fair

2141
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,000
value got forms

2142
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,840
equilibrium

2143
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,000
what do you think's significant about

2144
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,340
that 50 level

2145
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,320
and why didn't that Gap fully close

2146
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,420
it's a measuring Gap

2147
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,280
that Fairway Gap is a measuring Gap this

2148
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,840
low this candle did not come to that

2149
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,580
candle's High

2150
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,960
uh oh

2151
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,000
we're seeing some context and narrative

2152
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,179
that just ain't in your books baby

2153
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:26,400
that means we can anticipate this price

2154
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,980
run here to here to be duplicated to the

2155
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:29,940
upside

2156
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,980
meaning

2157
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,860
let's say we have

2158
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,620
this low is lower than that low and that

2159
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,560
low and relatively equal to that one we

2160
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,820
don't need this low here we want to see

2161
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,620
the energetic price run that's this one

2162
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,960
here so where's that root that root

2163
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,739
price run begin that low right there

2164
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:53,699
so if we take that and measured up to

2165
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:56,460
the high of that fair bet you got

2166
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,380
why that because that's the highest

2167
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,060
range so you want to use that as your

2168
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,260
base Point extend it from there

2169
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,120
and you're putting it right on that same

2170
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,739
I'll show you like what I'm doing this I

2171
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:10,340
can give you one second

2172
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,900
I'm taking that high of the fair bag out

2173
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,640
here's the low of the fair value I'm

2174
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,500
I've duplicated that so we now are

2175
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,420
seeing a range that's projected to go

2176
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,060
above this Gap

2177
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,340
which is why I was saying I want to see

2178
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,980
it go through it and then treat this Gap

2179
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:28,500
as support

2180
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,020
this was the draw

2181
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,900
now it does go through it

2182
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,440
here's the upper 25 of it okay it comes

2183
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,460
back down

2184
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,260
immediate rebalance

2185
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,179
one day delay

2186
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:43,679
remember when I talked about immediate

2187
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,719
rebalance it's that next day or the very

2188
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:48,000
next day after that then you'll see the

2189
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,340
price run there it is

2190
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,500
goes into the weekly order block

2191
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,719
trades up into the daily order block and

2192
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,199
the weekly mean threshold order block

2193
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,420
trades all up into those levels each one

2194
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,580
of these targets

2195
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,280
okay you're looking for price to

2196
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,340
continuously reach for them

2197
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,620
you don't want to think that okay this

2198
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,600
is my first objective and once it trades

2199
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,760
there go try to find some other set up

2200
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,800
in another Market no you want to stick

2201
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,060
with it does it continuously keep

2202
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,980
digging into that the next level it does

2203
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,560
okay the last review I did I said okay

2204
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,880
this is the level we're looking at next

2205
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,080
we want to see if it wants to reach up

2206
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,360
in that 104.54

2207
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,340
it did

2208
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,980
every time it was digging higher I

2209
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,840
literally watched people on social media

2210
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,960
 about their long positions in Euro

2211
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,320
failing

2212
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,420
this is the reason why it kept going

2213
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,219
higher if the dollar is going to go

2214
01:24:44,219 --> 01:24:46,440
higher euro is going to fall it's going

2215
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,640
to go lower

2216
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,739
and then it drops from there down to

2217
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:51,239
some random level

2218
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:54,980
which is let me get this off here

2219
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,980
down close candle

2220
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,960
inside the weekly order block I'm sorry

2221
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,280
weekly fair value got which is now an

2222
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,100
inversion Fairway Gap this is the

2223
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,980
treatment of it on the daily chart it

2224
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,960
comes down hits it

2225
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,000
look at the reaction there do you think

2226
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,679
he could have took shorts in euro dollar

2227
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,659
on that right there and the last one to

2228
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:18,060
three days well let's go over to euro

2229
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:18,960
dollar

2230
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,000
finally get the hell off of the dollar

2231
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,800
Index get to something that makes sense

2232
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,480
we don't trade a dollar around here

2233
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,659
right

2234
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:30,000
so here is the euro dollar

2235
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,340
and this is the daily chart this is the

2236
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,560
immediate rebalance right here

2237
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,080
one Euro and this was the Fair bet you

2238
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,580
got I mentioned that we would draw down

2239
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,280
into up here we drew down into it and

2240
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,199
then we rallied one more time

2241
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:47,040
into this up close candle right here

2242
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,380
that's a bare shorter block oh here we

2243
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,260
go with the hindsight folks listen

2244
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,300
your surgeon that cut on you and did

2245
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,159
your surgery before he got his license

2246
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,620
he was cutting on cadavers that means

2247
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,560
dead people that can't sue you so that's

2248
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,480
hindsight too he's looking at something

2249
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,179
that is a safe he doesn't want to do an

2250
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:08,159
exploratory surgery on you while you're

2251
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,060
living

2252
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,639
and try to do new things they have to do

2253
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:12,900
those things

2254
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,739
clinically in cadavers you bodies that

2255
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:18,600
have been offered to science for

2256
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,159
research

2257
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,500
you need to go through these exercises

2258
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,020
yourself look at PA study not

2259
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,000
just recently go back through all of

2260
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,320
this stuff here

2261
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,960
and that's what back testing is it's not

2262
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,679
going into a Forex tester and testing

2263
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:37,020
the thing that that's a mock-up forward

2264
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,600
test without live data that's a stage

2265
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,520
you can include yeah but when I say back

2266
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,380
testing you're going through old moves

2267
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,380
and studying and breaking them down

2268
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,179
that you're really going in there in

2269
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:50,219
detail looking at what it's done what

2270
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:52,139
what it didn't do where you would have

2271
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:53,699
been stopped out and being honest about

2272
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:56,040
that how much risk would have been

2273
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,860
incurred not using the best entry use

2274
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,199
the worst potential entry then does it

2275
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,920
pay it out still okay so

2276
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,360
here's a fair bag app I told you we

2277
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,820
would gravitate down two and let's go

2278
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,199
back over the last few days here here's

2279
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:11,400
your order block here on your daily

2280
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,360
chart

2281
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:17,000
let's drop into a 60 Minute chart

2282
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,980
in this high

2283
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,080
down to that low here

2284
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,900
do you see anything that stands out I'll

2285
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:31,040
give you a minute while I'll get a drink

2286
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,699
but what did I just teach you about

2287
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,540
dealing ranges

2288
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:45,120
you break the the dealing range down

2289
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,980
if we were seeing the Dollar Tree down

2290
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,380
into that inversion Fairway you got

2291
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,300
on the daily chart

2292
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,100
the inversion pair backup is based on

2293
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,360
this weekly chart

2294
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,820
that is a discount for dollar we could

2295
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,520
likely see it rally dollar rallied that

2296
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,440
means that we're likely to see euro

2297
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,719
dollar sell off how can we anticipate

2298
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,219
that and where would it form

2299
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,940
here's your high

2300
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,219
down to that low right there

2301
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,880
where's equilibrium 50 right here in

2302
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,340
close proximity what do you see

2303
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,560
as a PD array that would be at that

2304
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,540
level or higher for a premium remember

2305
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,460
if we want to be short the highest

2306
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,860
probability shorts are occurring in

2307
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,100
premium markets above equilibrium

2308
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,719
continuation pattern or continuation

2309
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,920
premium

2310
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,560
for selling short in a

2311
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,300
bear Market it's been a bear market for

2312
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,219
a while you can sell right at the 50

2313
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:39,179
level

2314
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:41,760
but specifically

2315
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,040
in a premium we want to see it get into

2316
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,239
this range

2317
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,120
here

2318
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,679
to here

2319
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:55,580
is premium

2320
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,719
in that range

2321
01:28:57,719 --> 01:28:59,699
between this low

2322
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:02,460
and that high where is the PD array that

2323
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,980
the first one exists

2324
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,780
at a premium and that range from this

2325
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,639
high down to that low

2326
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:11,520
when we re when we retraced higher went

2327
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,380
into this area right here it went to

2328
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,340
this

2329
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,620
area which is a city south side

2330
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:19,940
imbalanced by side and efficiency

2331
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,500
so if this is what you saw

2332
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,420
congratulations you did it right

2333
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,400
and it trades up into it here

2334
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,040
dollar goes higher because it's on its

2335
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,380
inversion for your bank account

2336
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:38,360
you're a dollar sells off

2337
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,520
this area right in here also is running

2338
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,139
what

2339
01:29:43,139 --> 01:29:46,040
buy stops

2340
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:49,739
retail Traders see this run here

2341
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:51,600
in all this consolidation they see that

2342
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,920
as a bull flag

2343
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,340
so they're thinking something like this

2344
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,960
euro dollar has been going down for a

2345
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,719
long time it must have made it low

2346
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,239
and they see this right here as a flag

2347
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:04,980
pattern you see how it's like a big

2348
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,620
flagpole consolidation and they think if

2349
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,300
it can break Above This High here it

2350
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:10,860
will duplicate

2351
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:14,540
it'll duplicate that same run

2352
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,280
oops

2353
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,280
once we break the high

2354
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,659
they want to see it trade back up in

2355
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:26,699
here or something that effect I'm doing

2356
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:29,420
it very Loosely because

2357
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:32,340
bull flags and bear flags are trash but

2358
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,900
the

2359
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:37,139
the logic here is opposed to what a

2360
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:40,260
retail minded Trader would see and it's

2361
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,440
taking liquidity into account that means

2362
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,199
the market went lower we traded here and

2363
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:47,600
we started to move a little bit here

2364
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,000
nobody in their right mind keyword

2365
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,679
would have trailed their stop loss on

2366
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:55,139
shorts to that that level right there

2367
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:58,800
but on this move lower I promise you

2368
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,239
every time they can hear you out there

2369
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,400
that's trading Forex because they're

2370
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,960
Ultra scared they don't want to get

2371
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,820
stopped out they don't they don't want

2372
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:09,060
to have their profits erode in the

2373
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,620
trailer stop loss too tight and you know

2374
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,880
what I'm talking about you're not in

2375
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,199
your head thinking stop talking about me

2376
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:17,820
there's liquidity above old highs and

2377
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,739
lows that's 101 in terms of

2378
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:21,120
understanding where markets are going to

2379
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,620
reach for liquidity

2380
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,739
but if you can see that liquidity and

2381
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:28,679
pair it with some retail minded idea

2382
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:30,719
that would be opposed to what I'm

2383
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,520
teaching you

2384
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,080
remember I'm teaching you how smart

2385
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,679
money sees price and engages it I'm

2386
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,900
teaching what the algorithm does so the

2387
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,300
algorithm will deliver price Above This

2388
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,360
High to take into account for buy stocks

2389
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,860
being brought to the marketplace those

2390
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,560
Market orders are now buying at the

2391
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,460
market

2392
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,159
which is what smart money will offer

2393
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:54,179
shorts

2394
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:55,800
to the marketplace at that same time

2395
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,440
where and what price range in this fair

2396
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,719
value guy

2397
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,080
where would be the opposing draw on

2398
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,719
price once it went into here right about

2399
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:08,580
this High here is the buy stop so it

2400
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,320
trades there which is the opposite of

2401
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,000
what we saw a dollar doing at this

2402
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,620
moment right here

2403
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,699
dollar Index

2404
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:19,800
let's see here right at uh 2 A.M on

2405
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,060
third Tuesday June 6th okay 2 A.M

2406
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,199
the dollar Index

2407
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,420
was making that low here on the fair

2408
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,900
value guy

2409
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,239
see that so it's a mirror image so

2410
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,460
you're qualifying setups not just on the

2411
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,840
basis of you see it on your chart you're

2412
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,040
trading you have to use some

2413
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,480
inter-market relationships that would

2414
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,520
say the opposite for instance if we're

2415
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,560
trying to go short on Euro you want to

2416
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,760
see something that would constitute a

2417
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,920
long in dollar if you can't really see

2418
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,840
it in dollar that's opposed to your

2419
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,760
cable trade which is pound dollar or

2420
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,580
Fiber which is zero USD whatever you're

2421
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,219
trying to do in your Forex pair it needs

2422
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:02,880
to be in a setup that would be opposing

2423
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,560
in the dollar

2424
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,920
if it's a Forex pair that has a currency

2425
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,420
other than the dollar in the first of

2426
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,739
its name

2427
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:13,440
if we see this setup here that's

2428
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,420
potentially long for dollar which is

2429
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,120
we're trading in that fair value

2430
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,980
if we're expecting prices to go high for

2431
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,380
a dollar we would look for pairs that

2432
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:25,080
begin with US dollar in their name like

2433
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:29,040
dollar Yen dollar swissy

2434
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,800
those pairs would mirror what dollar

2435
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,739
Index is doing which is go higher

2436
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,659
but because the dollar is likely to go

2437
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:39,360
higher here and euro dollar

2438
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,139
being inversely related to it

2439
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:45,300
it's going to go lower but it's not

2440
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,100
randomly just going to some level and

2441
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,920
starting some you know

2442
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,719
mystery as to why it was going to go

2443
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:53,940
lower it's what I'm teaching you this

2444
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,639
range the algorithm refers back to it so

2445
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,920
it only needs to go up to equilibrium

2446
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,260
slightly higher so we measure that with

2447
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,179
the 50 level that's the only thing I'm

2448
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,800
using the Fibonacci for

2449
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,159
I'm not using Fibonacci for entries I'm

2450
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,739
using Fibonacci for premium and discount

2451
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:12,120
range

2452
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,820
delineating a specific range to know

2453
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:18,179
where a setup should likely form but in

2454
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:20,040
that range what range specifically it's

2455
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,460
this

2456
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,920
there somewhere in that portion of this

2457
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,800
price like lower I'm going to look for a

2458
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,980
premium array well which ones exist

2459
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,570
we have the FVG here

2460
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,699
[Music]

2461
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:40,320
man I should have charged money good

2462
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,540
grief this this I could have made easily

2463
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:45,560
a hundred thousand dollars on this

2464
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,360
just folks relax

2465
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,460
so that's that's the first one that's

2466
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,380
your first premium array using month

2467
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,260
Force lessons on The pdra Matrix

2468
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:01,639
so what's the next one

2469
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:05,159
are all down closed candles back and

2470
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:06,840
forth PA so all of this right

2471
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,739
here

2472
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:10,260
this is balanced we've had lots of up

2473
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,239
and down movement in here

2474
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,500
and then we go back to the little high

2475
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,360
so we have an order block

2476
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,159
which is the last up close candle with

2477
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,980
the highest close so it would be the

2478
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,900
opening price that would be Dylan needed

2479
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,540
there why would it need to go there

2480
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,440
it doesn't because it's shielded by all

2481
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,780
of this up and down movement there's no

2482
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,219
inefficiency

2483
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:35,219
none zero

2484
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:38,820
so what PD array do you use that one

2485
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:41,880
which did the market use that one

2486
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:44,159
what time of day did it occur London

2487
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,239
Kill Zone

2488
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,739
two o'clock in the morning

2489
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:49,080
that's what I teach you

2490
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,739
what's the opposing DOL

2491
01:35:52,739 --> 01:35:54,780
okay so you've got this much right how

2492
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:55,980
do I know

2493
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,540
where price is going to go to next

2494
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,920
Michael because that's what you're all

2495
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,120
wondering whenever I tell you

2496
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,199
something's going to happen I said hey

2497
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,239
here it is folks you know it it panned

2498
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:06,260
out invariably

2499
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:09,600
folks will come out and say all right

2500
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,040
what's next

2501
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,560
they're wanting me to get it wrong

2502
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,480
they want me to get it wrong so they can

2503
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,739
say ha ha

2504
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:19,920
you had 9 000 times in the recent that

2505
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,540
you got it right but look what you just

2506
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,060
did you missed on this one buddy haha

2507
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:27,440
you're a fraud scammer

2508
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:30,360
you can't win with some people but

2509
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,219
if you're looking at that as liquidity

2510
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:35,159
here okay and we're at equilibrium or

2511
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:38,639
higher that means we are truly over

2512
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,020
bought

2513
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:42,300
there's no indicator required to see

2514
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,400
that you don't need to put a Williams

2515
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,020
percent R up you don't need to put a

2516
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:48,060
stochastic up you don't need a CCI you

2517
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,739
don't need a macd you don't need ads

2518
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:52,139
though this chart is only showing you

2519
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,300
ranges being measured which is what the

2520
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,380
FIB is

2521
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,699
and then

2522
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:58,340
looking for

2523
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:01,199
inefficiencies or liquidity and I draw

2524
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,060
that out on the chart so that way you

2525
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,040
can see it it gives you like a visual

2526
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,679
eye candy that your

2527
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,260
attention is focused at a specific area

2528
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,420
on a chart and then I go and I talk

2529
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:13,860
about what that is so that way you can

2530
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:15,300
see it and understand how to use it

2531
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,040
going forward

2532
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,280
so at this moment right here

2533
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,320
if in fact the market does go higher to

2534
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,239
take the buy stops here and just trade

2535
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,739
into a short-term premium which is

2536
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:27,900
relative to this the only Range High and

2537
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,159
that low

2538
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:32,340
do you can hopefully you guys can see

2539
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,620
this run from this high down to that low

2540
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:37,500
probably that's retracement this is a

2541
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,900
significant price swing like I'm not

2542
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,280
looking at like this little thing here

2543
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,440
to here that I'm not concerned about

2544
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,500
that I want to focus on intermediate

2545
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,300
term price runs

2546
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,159
regardless of whatever time frame I'm

2547
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:53,940
looking at my eye goes to specifics

2548
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,980
in PA I'm not just taking

2549
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,080
every little micro price swing I'm

2550
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,100
looking at

2551
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,639
from here to here

2552
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,760
maybe from here to here but from here to

2553
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,920
here absolutely

2554
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,159
and whenever I see these ranges on the

2555
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:13,260
weekend or in the morning I'll go

2556
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,699
through my charts

2557
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:16,320
before the kill zones or before the

2558
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,540
sessions begin and I'm doing this with

2559
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,340
all the ranges that are

2560
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:23,580
Salient which is you daily

2561
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,580
four hour an hourly and 15 minutes so

2562
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,960
I'm looking at all the potential dealing

2563
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,940
ranges that the market May refer back to

2564
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,340
and then I weigh out whether or not like

2565
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,139
I just did with this price run here from

2566
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:36,300
high to low how many PD arrays are there

2567
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,840
so you think because I've taught you

2568
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,760
the

2569
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,380
the propulsion block

2570
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:45,380
FVG

2571
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:48,000
institutional order flow entry drill

2572
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,960
bearish order block

2573
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,800
ing block

2574
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,040
all those things

2575
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,100
you're thinking okay which one do I use

2576
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,500
here's a perfect example which occurred

2577
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,239
in that price run

2578
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:06,000
just the fair value got

2579
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,739
that's all

2580
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:09,600
and it only needed to go up to this

2581
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,159
level here at the same time it went down

2582
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,679
to its FVG on the dollar

2583
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,420
dollar went down to a discount it's

2584
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:16,320
bullish

2585
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,560
Euro went up to a premium bearish

2586
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,020
time of day two o'clock what's the

2587
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,580
candle here what's the time

2588
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:26,219
it's always local time New York you're

2589
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:28,199
you're trading view chart should always

2590
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,000
be set to New York

2591
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,679
that's the time that the algorithm runs

2592
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,080
on I don't care what anybody else says

2593
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,920
okay this is the way it's coded

2594
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,500
so it reports

2595
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,480
on time on duty at two o'clock in the

2596
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,560
morning after

2597
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:49,820
hitting this then prices allowed to run

2598
01:39:51,179 --> 01:39:54,480
higher higher higher higher then in two

2599
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,760
o'clock off the races boom what's it

2600
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,020
going to reach for

2601
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:00,719
how do I how do I Target a run like that

2602
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,580
where does it go to next

2603
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,900
well if it went off the buy side

2604
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,040
here

2605
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,100
and it went into uh inefficiency

2606
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:15,480
here it's in a premium above 50 percent

2607
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,980
and the dollar is looking to go higher

2608
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,420
it's in a short-term discount it's in a

2609
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,520
FVG

2610
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,739
nothing says the dollar topped I don't

2611
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:25,500
try to pick tops I'm trading in the meat

2612
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,940
middle

2613
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,500
you don't need the Precision highs and

2614
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,880
the Precision lows you don't need that

2615
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,340
you should you try to avoid that when

2616
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:34,620
you're using HTF charts

2617
01:40:34,620 --> 01:41:09,840
try to avoid picking tops and bottles on
hard time frame charts you absolutely
can pick tops and bottoms in the lower
time frame charts because they're going
to behave
subordinate to the HTF
what I mean by that
if we're bullish on weekly and daily
charts for dollar
it's real easy to nail down right to the
PIP
short-term lows
at
key times or kill zones for
dollar Index intraday
it's just using these types of tools
here

2635
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:13,620
but if you're going short here

2636
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,540
and you're looking for

2637
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:18,179
the opposing DOL

2638
01:41:18,179 --> 01:41:21,840
that's this low right there what what's

2639
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,460
the reason behind that

2640
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,139
what would be at that low of any

2641
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:27,060
importance and why would it want to

2642
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,460
revisit that low because it was a sharp

2643
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:32,400
rally here this induces traders that go

2644
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,739
along the pattern that they formed here

2645
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:37,199
is a pseudo bull flag I teach that in

2646
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,060
the core content where do fake bull

2647
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,340
Flags occur

2648
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:43,080
in this situation like this and what I

2649
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,699
teach in a core content

2650
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:48,179
it only goes up enough to validate the

2651
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:51,300
buyers on breakout on a bull flag

2652
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,800
but it only really goes up to where I

2653
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,780
teach you the algorithm sees this area

2654
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:57,320
right there

2655
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,880
it runs above that short-term High here

2656
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:02,699
and then because it took buy stops in to

2657
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:05,100
the marketplace smartmailing smart

2658
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:10,320
Milling smart money goes short here

2659
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,600
so they're selling short here at the buy

2660
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,560
stops so

2661
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,540
two things are being accomplished here

2662
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:36,900
Fair Vega premium it trades up into it

2663
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,600
and takes the buy stops or buy side

2664
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,139
liquidity right there this high

2665
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:44,880
so your chart would look like this for

2666
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,920
annotation purposes and for your journal

2667
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,219
entry

2668
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:05,780
I know man this is awesome

2669
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,560
you're all thinking I wish I would have

2670
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,659
known this stuff two years ago six

2671
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:12,600
months ago I know so those buy stops

2672
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,080
that buy sell liquidity has been purged

2673
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:21,659
so if smart money is selling

2674
01:43:21,659 --> 01:43:24,920
to those buyers

2675
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:28,679
what are they trying to get out at

2676
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:30,000
discount

2677
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,639
your eye goes right to where retail

2678
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:36,000
would be trying to be fortifying

2679
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,679
or protecting their position

2680
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,280
we'll be resting below that low

2681
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,179
sell sign

2682
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,820
doing a clinic today

2683
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:00,420
give me a thumbs up if you want me to do

2684
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,699
one of these every day this week

2685
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:05,159
except for Friday I got I got plans on

2686
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:05,940
Friday

2687
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:09,000
if you want to see me do this

2688
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,699
every day this week

2689
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:14,460
Live on YouTube

2690
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,619
and teach you stuff that will knock your

2691
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:18,119
socks off

2692
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:21,239
thumbs up this video or this live stream

2693
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:23,340
I like that it's pretty fair

2694
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,540
request

2695
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:27,719
so the market drops precipitously

2696
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:29,940
and goes right to where the sell side

2697
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,320
liquidity is

2698
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,760
see that

2699
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:33,900
now

2700
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,179
what you want to study is because we

2701
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:38,760
have that Gap this old Gap here that's a

2702
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:40,199
daily let's go back to the Daily road

2703
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:41,580
trip real quick

2704
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:44,159
that's this FVG right there

2705
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,020
okay

2706
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:49,320
because we're inside that range

2707
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:52,139
and

2708
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:53,699
we're here

2709
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:56,280
we have a gap that's outside of it you

2710
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,600
see that here

2711
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,000
we have that right there and we have

2712
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,560
this up close candle right there so

2713
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,060
that's a this is a bearish order block

2714
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,920
and it's also right in the middle of

2715
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,600
that shaded area which is the daily fair

2716
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,100
that you got so this is consequent

2717
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,800
encroachment essentially right there

2718
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,340
so in my mind if we want to take

2719
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,159
this low here out where another level of

2720
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:20,239
sell side would reside

2721
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,880
how I'm doing that in case you're

2722
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,980
wondering I highlight it by clicking it

2723
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,420
when they have the little balls on each

2724
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:29,040
end

2725
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,400
you go anywhere where the ball isn't

2726
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,020
and you hold down control and drag it

2727
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:35,520
away from it and you can create a

2728
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,000
duplicate

2729
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:40,739
and then drag this over hold down shift

2730
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:42,480
and it'll make your line straight I

2731
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,400
learned that from my students so I'm

2732
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,320
very appreciative of that oh every time

2733
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,820
I do a live stream

2734
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:50,040
or do a video and people watch me do

2735
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,840
things on trading view I always get

2736
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,960
emails messages or whatever same here's

2737
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,460
a tip for trading View and I love that

2738
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,500
thank you so much

2739
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,420
so you'd be watching this

2740
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,540
there's your order block

2741
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,179
foreign

2742
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:12,600
I would want to see it stay below this

2743
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,860
candle

2744
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:15,900
more specifically using that level here

2745
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,880
but if it trades Above This

2746
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,340
candle here I would be sitting still one

2747
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:21,719
euro

2748
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:23,520
I'm not saying it's a short

2749
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,639
but for me if it wants to go lower it

2750
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,920
would need this see that Candlestick

2751
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,199
keep it at Bay and not trade back to the

2752
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,460
high end of the Fair makeup on the daily

2753
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:35,100
chart it doesn't need to do that

2754
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:37,320
because if it does it means something

2755
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:40,080
all together something else and it's not

2756
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,940
a trading environment for me to do if I

2757
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,619
was to look at it that way

2758
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:45,480
and it's already fulfilled a role here

2759
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,880
it took buy stops and then sell stops so

2760
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,440
in my mind it can consolidate but if it

2761
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,179
wants to go lower it would need to stay

2762
01:46:51,179 --> 01:46:53,040
in the lower half of this shaded area

2763
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,900
right in here okay all right so that is

2764
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:00,480
the business on that

2765
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,960
um I talked about

2766
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,420
Breakaway gaps I talked about uh

2767
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,179
pdra Matrix and how you shouldn't be

2768
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:10,560
worrying about

2769
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,840
which PD array

2770
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,880
um you trade the one that the market

2771
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,260
gives you

2772
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,300
not all of my PD arrays are going to

2773
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,300
exist in every price run

2774
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,159
I mean that that's that's an epiphany

2775
01:47:23,159 --> 01:47:25,020
right there for some of you because you

2776
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,360
think that every single one of those PD

2777
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,520
arrays exist in every fractal of price

2778
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,080
action

2779
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,580
it doesn't

2780
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,980
so when I'm looking at price and the

2781
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,780
people that don't like me or they sell

2782
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,300
something they view me as a competitor

2783
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,820
they try to derail your studies and put

2784
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,380
nonsense about me out there and make up

2785
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:46,320
lies and new whatever Photoshop stuff

2786
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,119
they can't erase the fact that I'm

2787
01:47:48,119 --> 01:47:49,619
calling it before it happens

2788
01:47:49,619 --> 01:47:51,179
and they can't erase the fact that my

2789
01:47:51,179 --> 01:47:52,500
students are now making fortunes with it

2790
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,760
with real money

2791
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,219
in leading the pack and profitability

2792
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:58,920
so we are the cult of profitability you

2793
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,320
want to be a cult member to sign up

card number you don't have to do any of

2798
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,239
that stuff I don't run Discord channels

2799
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:11,520
I am not teaching you crypto if anybody

2800
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,719
says anything

2801
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,659
that I'm touching crypto they're a fraud

2802
01:48:15,659 --> 01:48:17,699
they're a scammer I am not doing any of

2803
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,199
that I'm not running some private little

2804
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,000
area drawing people in you're never

2805
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,440
going to hear me say you want to join my

2806
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,179
private mentorship for money if they're

2807
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:27,179
telling you that I am

2808
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:30,420
offering that that's not me

2809
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,420
drop it don't do it I'm not charging you

2810
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:36,179
I'm doing I'm gladly doing this

2811
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:38,699
I'm enjoying this

2812
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:40,380
and it doesn't cost you anything but

2813
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,520
your attention

2814
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,080
and then you have to study it after we

2815
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,060
spend time together

2816
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,500
so I've covered what I want to cover

2817
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,000
here on

2818
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,100
Forex but let me just uh

2819
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,560
drop into cable real quick I haven't

2820
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,340
looked at her for a while

2821
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,619
yeah I would have preferred uh

2822
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:04,440
Euro over Cable cable doesn't have all

2823
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,960
that much clean run in here it's this is

2824
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,260
too muddy muddy meeting it's got like a

2825
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:13,320
smaller Gap here another Gap here and I

2826
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,460
don't like that

2827
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,440
it's not as clean and obvious enough

2828
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,480
take a look at this chart in this area

2829
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,920
here

2830
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,440
okay look at this area here on cable

2831
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,960
which is pound the versus US dollar

2832
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,639
pound dollar

2833
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:29,820
look at that and compare it to Euro I'll

2834
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:33,179
toggle back and forth for a second

2835
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:35,580
you see how obvious that is that that

2836
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,920
Gap really stands out and it's singular

2837
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,840
one

2838
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,560
one of them versus same area look you're

2839
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,139
looking there uh cable chart

2840
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:48,960
got Gap

2841
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,679
what's cleaner PA Euro so if I

2842
01:49:52,679 --> 01:49:55,139
were trading last night in London

2843
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,600
session which one would I have traded I

2844
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,400
would have traded the euro

2845
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,320
I would have not taken any trade in

2846
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,659
cable even though cable did in fact run

2847
01:50:03,659 --> 01:50:06,719
lower it didn't go down to take out its

2848
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:07,980
sell side because it only needed to go

2849
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:10,199
down into this imbalance here

2850
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:12,719
and that's where we saw a trade to so I

2851
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,639
wouldn't touch cable here the euro

2852
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,560
dollar last night was really nice

2853
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,360
and let's take us into

2854
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:22,739
the weekly chart

2855
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:26,040
and let's look at ES

2856
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,679
and then bring this discussion today to

2857
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:29,940
a close

2858
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:32,159
I know I know can't you make it one of

2859
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,020
those four hour sessions nah not really

2860
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:35,460
because if I want to do this every day I

2861
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,960
want to kind of preserve my

2862
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,239
release

2863
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:42,420
so here is the business on the weekly

2864
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,840
chart for e-mini s p so for all you die

2865
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,520
hard Forex folks that don't think you're

2866
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,080
ever going to learn anything from me by

2867
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,500
teaching Forex Concepts in es trading

2868
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,080
because it's not limited to just Forex

2869
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,600
in my stuff that I teach in

2870
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,780
yes unless specifically stated

2871
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:02,699
its price delivery

2872
01:51:02,699 --> 01:51:05,219
so smart money Concepts

2873
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:06,900
SMC

2874
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,580
that's my work

2875
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:12,119
these are my Creations this is my stuff

2876
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:14,580
if you want to learn how to do this I'm

2877
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:16,380
showing you it

2878
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:19,260
doesn't have barriers by asset

2879
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:20,820
it's not limited

2880
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,280
so because my focus has been primarily

2881
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,480
on index features

2882
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,000
all of the all the teachings obviously

2883
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,639
are being seen in this medium or asset

2884
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,040
it doesn't mean that it can't work in

2885
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,040
Forex or that it stopped in Forex it

2886
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:39,600
just means that my attention is in this

2887
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,860
market here

2888
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:43,199
all right so now think about what we

2889
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,540
were talking about in relationship to

2890
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,820
the bond market okay now we're going to

2891
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,980
take a little bit of a step back

2892
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,560
and think

2893
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,619
if the bond market is signaling that it

2894
01:51:55,619 --> 01:51:57,239
wanted to go lower recently out of that

2895
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:59,100
range then I'll I'll take you back to

2896
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,480
that chart in a second when we get to

2897
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,639
the daily chart with e-mini s p

2898
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,940
but that bond market moving lower

2899
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:08,219
sets the tone for

2900
01:52:08,219 --> 01:52:10,080
a market

2901
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,560
that will see movement because we left a

2902
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,139
range in bonds so therefore all other

2903
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:18,600
asset classes are free to move

2904
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,639
they're free to move

2905
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:24,360
and they leave the consolidation

2906
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:27,600
so once we are in that profile

2907
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,199
the profile being we're in a trending

2908
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:33,000
environment not consolidation

2909
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,760
or in trending that means that price

2910
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:38,760
swings can now evolve and allow daily

2911
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,679
charts to start booking

2912
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:43,440
sustained runs not just intraday

2913
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,540
volatility only and that's your that's

2914
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,820
your you know Cuisine you have to eat

2915
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,500
from it's a little bit more of a

2916
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,060
sustained price run when the bond

2917
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,040
markets are trending if the bond market

2918
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,960
is consolidating

2919
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,920
that is a true testimony to anticipate

2920
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,840
consolidation in your in your specific

2921
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:03,179
Market whether it be bonds or whether it

2922
01:53:03,179 --> 01:53:05,040
be index Futures whether it be

2923
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,420
Forex

2924
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:10,020
it is a precursor to tell you what type

2925
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,719
of environment we are in from a macro

2926
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:13,739
stance

2927
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:16,199
it does not mean that you can't make

2928
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:18,300
money within that or outside of it only

2929
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,159
it just means that from a market

2930
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:23,040
profiling stance that I call profile

2931
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,960
it's not the volume

2932
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,780
profile where you see all these little

2933
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:29,880
horizontal volume you know communicators

2934
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,820
and such none of that is necessary V WAP

2935
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,400
is not necessary level two data not

2936
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:38,280
necessary in all those PA uh

2937
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,560
junkies that use the ladders you know on

2938
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,520
the right side of the truck it looks

2939
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:42,780
cooled on it seeing all that stuff

2940
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:44,520
flashing around that's distracting you

2941
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,600
don't need that

2942
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:48,000
everything you need is in the chart a

2943
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,920
time-based chart will give you

2944
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,960
everything you'll be able to forecast

2945
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,659
where and when they're going to form and

2946
01:53:54,659 --> 01:53:56,520
now guys those folks are waiting for

2947
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,360
something

2948
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,280
they needed to go to those levels and

2949
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,659
sometimes they don't work

2950
01:54:00,659 --> 01:54:02,699
when I'm teaching you how to anticipate

2951
01:54:02,699 --> 01:54:05,400
where and when these things will form

2952
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,619
and by doing it over time you

2953
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:09,179
desensitize yourself

2954
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:11,159
to the uncertainty where it's paralyzing

2955
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:12,420
fear right now and you're like I don't

2956
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:13,380
know what I'm doing this is so

2957
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,580
complicated

2958
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:16,199
go slow

2959
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:17,820
there's nobody I'm not telling you you

2960
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:18,780
should be trading with real money in

2961
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,400
your first year so why are you insisting

2962
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,780
that you should

2963
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:23,219
just because everybody else out there is

2964
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:24,780
doing it you don't know how long they've

2965
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,520
been studying you know how long they've

2966
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,199
worked very hard

2967
01:54:28,199 --> 01:54:29,580
and

2968
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:32,520
nobody comes out here you know Johnny on

2969
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,739
the spot first time never failed and as

2970
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:37,560
a superstar nobody nobody has ever done

2971
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,960
that okay they've always had some

2972
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,940
measure of learning that's required and

2973
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,100
some are faster than others and give

2974
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,020
yourself permission to grow at your own

2975
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,360
pace I'm not grading you onion speed at

2976
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,619
which you find continuity and

2977
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:52,980
consistency so don't you do it either

2978
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:54,600
now

2979
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,239
we are I'm sure I'm looking at the chart

2980
01:54:57,239 --> 01:55:01,440
from right weekly chart on ES e-mini s p

2981
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,179
uh when we were down here in this Gap

2982
01:55:03,179 --> 01:55:05,159
year I said we're gonna look to trade up

2983
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:06,540
into this volume and balance which is

2984
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,100
the Shaded area in white

2985
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,860
the volume of balance is the opening on

2986
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:13,199
this candle here and the closing on that

2987
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:16,080
candle here there's no body

2988
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,400
by any

2989
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,020
candlestick

2990
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:22,860
ever since that formation there until

2991
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:25,199
this candle in this candle which was

2992
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,940
last week and the week prior

2993
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,260
notice that

2994
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,600
so this was the DOL and

2995
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,820
then I said inside of you want to see

2996
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:34,980
the real sweet spot would be that little

2997
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:38,780
separation right there this separation

2998
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:41,699
there with the blue lines that my

2999
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:43,260
friends

3000
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,560
is a real liquidity void

3001
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:50,219
that's an absence of any trading new

3002
01:55:50,219 --> 01:55:54,360
book price no delivery no trades were

3003
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,639
engaged no stocks were taken no entries

3004
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:58,080
were given

3005
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,639
there's no trading between those two

3006
01:55:59,639 --> 01:56:01,980
price points so while this was enough

3007
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,900
for the draw which is the volume and

3008
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:04,980
balance

3009
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,440
because we only had this little Wick

3010
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,119
between this closing price and this

3011
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:11,580
opening price my eye jumps to that and

3012
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,540
you can see the other one that I'm

3013
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,860
looking for if we continue on the upside

3014
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:16,080
it's here

3015
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,420
that's where I see it right here that

3016
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:20,400
same thing this right here look like

3017
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,800
that here when we were down here I said

3018
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,739
watch this FVG in this order

3019
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:27,360
block the opening price extended down

3020
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,880
don't take my word for it I have it in

3021
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,800
recording go look at it it's on the

3022
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,960
YouTube channel I do not delete tweets I

3023
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,000
do not change anything on my videos once

3024
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,920
they're up there you can't edit them

3025
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,719
they're there

3026
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:43,380
so we did in fact draw higher now here

3027
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,719
is one of those things that's making

3028
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,219
a lot more sense for the Die Hard

3029
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:52,139
students here that really want to know

3030
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:54,540
what it is that makes price behave a

3031
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,580
specific way

3032
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:58,679
bonds move lower

3033
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,420
out of the consolidation freeing up the

3034
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,219
markets to behave in a manner that's

3035
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:04,380
trending

3036
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,500
causing dollar to go higher

3037
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,920
dollar going higher is what risk on or

3038
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:13,260
risk off

3039
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,480
risk off

3040
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,139
meaning foreign currencies go lower

3041
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:22,800
meaning that the rallies in equities

3042
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,020
while they still can manifest and

3043
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:27,239
materialize they're going to be held at

3044
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:28,760
Bay they won't be

3045
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,320
explosive types of runs they're usually

3046
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:33,420
going to be like that keep on creeping

3047
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,159
higher small little retracements

3048
01:57:35,159 --> 01:57:37,860
creeping higher so that's profiling

3049
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,560
that's Market profiling understanding

3050
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,780
the behavior of how price will deliver

3051
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:45,300
now let me make a distinction in

3052
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:48,000
contrast it with something like this

3053
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,760
let's say for instance that

3054
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,159
we did not need

3055
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:55,679
to come back up to here

3056
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:57,659
say all this didn't exist as a volume

3057
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,520
and bounce and we didn't have this Gap

3058
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,280
here okay

3059
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,199
then

3060
01:58:04,199 --> 01:58:08,960
e-mini s p NASDAQ Dao could

3061
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,560
accelerate

3062
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,260
lower in shorts

3063
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:16,219
but because it is being manipulated

3064
01:58:16,219 --> 01:58:18,719
heavily the stock market should not be

3065
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:19,860
where it's at folks I'm gonna be real

3066
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,719
honest with you this thing should not be

3067
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:22,980
here

3068
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:26,460
but I have to follow the the breadcrumbs

3069
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:28,679
that the algorithm is laying out there

3070
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:31,380
this is what the smart money entity the

3071
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:32,820
people out there that's not making video

3072
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,920
courses and not on YouTube or not on

3073
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:37,260
Twitter they're not on TV Talking Heads

3074
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,400
they're not out there telling you what

3075
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,020
to do with your money because they're

3076
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:43,020
out there actively fleecing large funds

3077
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:45,000
they're trading against them they're

3078
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,159
their counterparty they're the people

3079
01:58:47,159 --> 01:58:49,199
that are inside the measurement of net

3080
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:52,260
net Trader position chart when you see

3081
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:54,480
the large Traders

3082
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:57,599
when they're trading they're

3083
01:58:57,599 --> 01:58:59,520
opposed to them they're providing the

3084
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,020
liquidity

3085
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,820
that's smart money

3086
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:06,300
and they're constantly in a dance with

3087
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:09,599
large funds constantly you learn how to

3088
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,460
place your stop loss

3089
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:13,679
with the same logic that they do

3090
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,440
and that's why you fall victim to it so

3091
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,880
while smart money is not out there

3092
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:22,080
looking for your one micro lot on Forex

3093
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,099
or your mini contract in s p they don't

3094
01:59:26,099 --> 01:59:28,440
see you they don't see your one contract

3095
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:30,480
that you're trading okay they don't see

3096
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,340
your micro contract your you know your

3097
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:33,800
little tiny insignificant anything

3098
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,060
they're not looking at you

3099
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:38,580
they're looking at the large pools of

3100
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:41,699
liquidity that large funds bring to the

3101
01:59:41,699 --> 01:59:44,940
marketplace and just like a

3102
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:48,060
a large fishing boat that drags a net

3103
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,980
okay they're out there trying to catch

3104
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:54,239
fish but sometimes these innocent

3105
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:57,060
dolphins and sea turtles get caught up

3106
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,340
in that net you're that dolphin and or

3107
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,400
sea turtle you just are a casualty of an

3108
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,420
event that's going to happen whether

3109
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:06,300
your stop was there or not

3110
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:09,659
so they're not out there to get you

3111
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:11,219
they're out there to get

3112
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:13,500
the large fish

3113
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:16,020
and if you're in the wake or in close

3114
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:18,540
proximity to where they are you're

3115
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:20,820
getting scooped up in that net too

3116
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:23,219
so it's imperative you understand how

3117
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:26,219
they go after that crowd of large

3118
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:27,840
liquidity

3119
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,159
and you have to learn how to navigate

3120
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:31,440
certain markets are going to behave in a

3121
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,420
behavior

3122
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:36,480
that is explosive sometimes

3123
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,820
and other times it's just something you

3124
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,340
you just can't you shouldn't be fighting

3125
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:42,300
it

3126
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:45,840
we've been calling es higher we've been

3127
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,000
looking for these very specific levels

3128
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,179
and it delivered like gangbusters

3129
02:00:51,179 --> 02:00:54,119
I told you that NQ or NASDAQ was the

3130
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:56,040
stronger to the upside

3131
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,719
why didn't you do all your trading in a

3132
02:00:57,719 --> 02:01:00,179
NASDAQ because I'm teaching that if you

3133
02:01:00,179 --> 02:01:03,659
use one medium one market

3134
02:01:03,659 --> 02:01:06,840
you can use even the stronger Market to

3135
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,780
trade this slower Market in sympathy

3136
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:12,119
it'll move with it meaning look at

3137
02:01:12,119 --> 02:01:13,340
NASDAQ

3138
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:16,739
nqm2023 on the weekly chart which one

3139
02:01:16,739 --> 02:01:18,360
was more explosive

3140
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:22,139
clearly NASDAQ you were told that NASDAQ

3141
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:24,000
was the stronger one to the upside so

3142
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,580
the sixth sister is what

3143
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,960
yes

3144
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:31,380
so es will move slower

3145
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:33,960
it'll still go higher

3146
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:38,960
but this imbalance over here

3147
02:01:40,139 --> 02:01:42,239
strongly and quickly

3148
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:47,239
reached to for NQ back to ES

3149
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:50,280
we have not even made its way up to that

3150
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:52,080
respective in Balance this volume

3151
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,340
balance

3152
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,020
see that

3153
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:56,699
still

3154
02:01:56,699 --> 02:01:59,099
es has moved higher but it does what

3155
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:02,460
performs lethargically as I told you it

3156
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,099
would because NQ was stronger I'm

3157
02:02:05,099 --> 02:02:07,080
teaching you visibility I'm teaching you

3158
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,360
how even if you were only following es

3159
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,699
and you never wanted to touch the NASDAQ

3160
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:13,560
because NASDAQ is a little bit Wilder

3161
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:15,420
it's thinner

3162
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:20,119
and because it's thinner it moves faster

3163
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:24,179
it runs for liquidity faster because

3164
02:02:24,179 --> 02:02:26,219
there's less contracts in close

3165
02:02:26,219 --> 02:02:28,139
proximity to market price so it will

3166
02:02:28,139 --> 02:02:30,599
quickly run farther away it will run 100

3167
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:34,500
handles faster than es will

3168
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,360
it doesn't need much to do 100 Handles

3169
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:38,340
in NASDAQ which is why you shouldn't be

3170
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,960
doing a lot of contracts in ignorance

3171
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:41,580
not knowing what you're doing

3172
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:44,280
that thing will roast you rip your face

3173
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,360
off and cremate you right there and

3174
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,920
restand

3175
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:48,239
but

3176
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:50,159
I can teach you how to find when it's

3177
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:52,219
going to be an outperformer sometimes

3178
02:02:52,219 --> 02:02:55,020
NASDAQ will be lethargic and it'll be

3179
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:57,599
reversed es will outperform it

3180
02:02:57,599 --> 02:02:59,880
somebody that's new or recently started

3181
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,139
trading they would think there's no way

3182
02:03:01,139 --> 02:03:02,639
that's like that listen I've been around

3183
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:05,219
here for 30 years I've seen it

3184
02:03:05,219 --> 02:03:06,960
but to know what it's going to do

3185
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,880
beforehand that's visibility that's

3186
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,800
experience you're learning that you

3187
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,599
experience that real time with me over

3188
02:03:12,599 --> 02:03:14,820
the last few weeks

3189
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:18,300
the benefit is now knowing what it did

3190
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:20,340
you can see that we have tools I have

3191
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:22,739
Concepts I have logic that can be

3192
02:03:22,739 --> 02:03:23,760
transferred to you and your

3193
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,440
understanding and you can take that

3194
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,639
going forward

3195
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,639
and also to relieve the people that are

3196
02:03:29,639 --> 02:03:30,659
new

3197
02:03:30,659 --> 02:03:34,940
and when they hear me say just follow ES

3198
02:03:35,099 --> 02:03:37,920
they're not upset because es didn't

3199
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,119
perform

3200
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,860
now if you're looking at saying you told

3201
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:43,020
me to follow yes I'm studying yes and

3202
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,580
even though you did say NASDAQ was going

3203
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,860
to be the upside leader and stronger I'm

3204
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:49,440
studying es and I'm regretful because I

3205
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,360
could have took live trades before you

3206
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,679
should have

3207
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:55,080
and made money in NASDAQ you're a jerk

3208
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,820
you're a terrible mentor

3209
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,560
well that's a student that's not really

3210
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,300
trying to learn that's somebody that you

3211
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:02,040
know is going to look for Fault In

3212
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:05,219
anything external apart from them

3213
02:04:05,219 --> 02:04:06,599
the reason why they didn't make them

3214
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:09,179
make money or more money is because of

3215
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:10,320
somebody else

3216
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:11,760
the reason why they lost money is

3217
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,619
because somebody else calls that they're

3218
02:04:13,619 --> 02:04:15,540
never going to be responsible and you

3219
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:17,880
have to be responsible you are in a

3220
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:20,280
driver's seat nothing I tell you should

3221
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:21,480
be a reason for you to press a button to

3222
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:23,940
get in Risk real money nothing not one

3223
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:24,719
thing

3224
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:27,420
which is why sometimes I'll say like I

3225
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:29,159
mentioned when the senators were all

3226
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:31,020
given Sally phones ahead of the more

3227
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:33,000
Memorial weekend I said anything can

3228
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,860
happen folks don't bet the farm on it be

3229
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:36,719
careful because I know there's a small

3230
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,159
group of you probably larger than I

3231
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,260
realize that are taking what I'm saying

3232
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,580
and going out there and trading with it

3233
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,500
with real money so I want to remind you

3234
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,780
there are real risks here

3235
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:47,880
I'm never painting this and you're going

3236
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,639
to get rich I'm never doing that but I'm

3237
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,440
teaching you and promising you that

3238
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,699
you're going to read PA better

3239
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:55,560
than any book course or Educators ever

3240
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,239
going to take you to they're never going

3241
02:04:57,239 --> 02:04:58,500
to get this they're never going to get

3242
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:01,020
like this there's so many facets to this

3243
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:04,320
stuff that helps you become a freak

3244
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,960
a Precision freak

3245
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:09,000
and when you are understanding the

3246
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,940
markets to this degree in this depth

3247
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:14,219
there's no reason you you never are

3248
02:05:14,219 --> 02:05:17,219
scared you're never fearful you respect

3249
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:19,199
the risk that the markets provide

3250
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,119
and offer many times

3251
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:23,340
but you're not paralyzed by uncertainty

3252
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,320
you know exactly what you're looking for

3253
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:27,239
you know what you're going to wait for

3254
02:05:27,239 --> 02:05:30,000
and when it forms you take the trade you

3255
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,500
take the entry you know where your

3256
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,880
Stop's going to be you know where your

3257
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,440
first partial you know you're second

3258
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,000
partial and where your Target's going to

3259
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,619
be

3260
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:40,080
you're not worrying about it

3261
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,840
because you understand yourself and you

3262
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:44,159
understand what the Market's likely to

3263
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:46,080
do because you've been studying it with

3264
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,540
great detail not just let me watch a

3265
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,099
couple videos of ICT I got this lick

3266
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:54,480
let's go no that's not how this works

3267
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,280
so

3268
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,199
yes

3269
02:05:58,199 --> 02:06:00,420
we had a real Gap here and that was

3270
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:01,920
where I took your attention to very

3271
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,840
specifically look here that's going to

3272
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,699
be the draw

3273
02:06:05,699 --> 02:06:09,119
imbalance whatever you got rallied right

3274
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,400
in there so in between here

3275
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,840
and here

3276
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:15,780
let's do the same thing we just did

3277
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,639
there's our low

3278
02:06:17,639 --> 02:06:20,520
that's where our price point started

3279
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,480
up to here

3280
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,179
in that run right there

3281
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,619
you can go into LTFs for

3282
02:06:34,619 --> 02:06:35,940
your own homework I'm not going to do it

3283
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:38,639
here this is for your study

3284
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,320
from here

3285
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,179
to here

3286
02:06:42,179 --> 02:06:44,340
on your FIB let me help you also because

3287
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:45,719
I know some of you are probably saying

3288
02:06:45,719 --> 02:06:48,179
can you open up your settings he read my

3289
02:06:48,179 --> 02:06:51,000
mind here's what my Fibonacci settings

3290
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,080
are

3291
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,340
okay

3292
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:54,540
so I'll leave that up here for a second

3293
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:57,199
so you can get it

3294
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:00,420
and these levels down here

3295
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:06,000
the 0.25 and the 0.75 with 0.50

3296
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,880
that is going to give you your

3297
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,040
gradient levels for grading a price

3298
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,320
swing which we're going to go into next

3299
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,239
okay but on the LTFs like

3300
02:07:15,239 --> 02:07:16,920
one minute and five minute charts look

3301
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:21,000
at that range around the 25 I'm sorry

3302
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,520
for around the 75 the 50 and the 25

3303
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,060
respectively and see if you don't see my

3304
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:30,659
PDA race manifesting there

3305
02:07:30,659 --> 02:07:35,219
we have this run down here

3306
02:07:35,219 --> 02:07:36,900
same thing you're going to do this is

3307
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,400
for homework

3308
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,800
from this low up to the high of that Gap

3309
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,719
right there that's the draw

3310
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:45,480
so if you were a swing Trader or a

3311
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,340
short-term Trader or a day trader

3312
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,980
working within this profile

3313
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:53,520
trying to find Longs where do they form

3314
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,300
price wise it's around this gradient

3315
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,159
the 50 percent

3316
02:07:59,159 --> 02:08:01,020
and the 25 percent

3317
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,880
go into your LTFs I could

3318
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,980
make this a five hour long video which I

3319
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:07,020
don't want to do but I promise if you go

3320
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,099
into your LTFs you're going

3321
02:08:08,099 --> 02:08:10,380
to see these levels there's PD arrays

3322
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,060
and setups that form there

3323
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:15,659
study that okay this will help you see

3324
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:18,060
algorithmic price delivery and that you

3325
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:20,580
can anticipate them where

3326
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:22,139
everybody else out there is waiting for

3327
02:08:22,139 --> 02:08:24,420
something let me ask you a question okay

3328
02:08:24,420 --> 02:08:26,880
for the folks that trade market uh

3329
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,900
profile and trade with v-wop

3330
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:35,159
where's B walk gonna be on Thursday at

3331
02:08:35,159 --> 02:08:37,639
10 A.M

3332
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:41,099
right

3333
02:08:41,099 --> 02:08:43,980
I can tell you where price is going to

3334
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:46,380
be and then I have elements in time that

3335
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:48,060
I use where I know they're both going to

3336
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:48,719
meet

3337
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:51,119
see you're a victim

3338
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,639
you're a casualty to uncertainty and you

3339
02:08:53,639 --> 02:08:55,080
have to wait around for something to

3340
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,460
react to

3341
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:58,260
just like an overbought or sold you

3342
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:00,060
can't do anything until that overbought

3343
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:02,099
or oversold indicator tells you you

3344
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:03,540
can't do anything directionally until

3345
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:05,940
your macd says it's sloping down or it's

3346
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:08,639
sloping up I don't have that my students

3347
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:10,920
don't have that and when I talk to you

3348
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,020
this way I'm not trying to be arrogant

3349
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:15,360
I'm not trying to be condescending I'm

3350
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,159
telling you what I'm doing is light

3351
02:09:17,159 --> 02:09:18,719
years ahead of everything that you're

3352
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:20,340
doing right now

3353
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,139
that's why when my results are being

3354
02:09:22,139 --> 02:09:23,520
shown to you it looks like it's

3355
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:25,980
cherry-picked but what do you do when

3356
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,780
when I'm doing it with weekly charts now

3357
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:30,060
in Daily charts and it's delivering

3358
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:32,040
how many things did I say in addition to

3359
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:33,900
this that didn't happen that it was only

3360
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:35,760
this

3361
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:37,800
and I say these types of things so I

3362
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,300
want people that are on the fence that

3363
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,340
listen to these goobers that just don't

3364
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,599
like the fact that I'm doing this for

3365
02:09:42,599 --> 02:09:44,880
free and I'm that good

3366
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,679
they want to take your attention away

3367
02:09:46,679 --> 02:09:47,699
from it

3368
02:09:47,699 --> 02:09:50,280
and I'm trying to be respectful to them

3369
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:51,239
because I could literally go ahead and

3370
02:09:51,239 --> 02:09:52,560
smash all of them

3371
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,480
but I don't want to do that that's not

3372
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,940
why I'm here I want to leave in November

3373
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:59,219
you know on a high note a good note

3374
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:02,639
where I'm not adversarial to anybody and

3375
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:03,780
I want even the people that don't like

3376
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:06,300
me and are selling other courses I want

3377
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,219
them whether they openly say they did it

3378
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:10,139
or not they can secretly add all the

3379
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:12,060
stuff I'm teaching if it makes their

3380
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,099
product better that makes them better

3381
02:10:14,099 --> 02:10:15,960
and that makes their patrons better

3382
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:18,360
that's all I care about I don't want to

3383
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,980
hurt anybody I don't want to make

3384
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:21,840
anybody you know lose their business

3385
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,619
okay I want to help that's all I'm doing

3386
02:10:25,619 --> 02:10:28,980
this for I Love It I enjoy it and I'm

3387
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:31,199
passionate about it and it's not limited

3388
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,239
this is the people that like me

3389
02:10:33,239 --> 02:10:34,380
I have a lot of people that are

3390
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:36,300
long-term followers and that were haters

3391
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:38,099
of me in the beginning

3392
02:10:38,099 --> 02:10:40,560
so let's go into a LTF

3393
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:43,739
discussion on ES let's go down into a

3394
02:10:43,739 --> 02:10:45,239
well let's let's just drop down to four

3395
02:10:45,239 --> 02:10:47,360
hour

3396
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:51,800
thank you

3397
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:58,679
so here's that daily discount fair value

3398
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:00,659
in the market rallied

3399
02:11:00,659 --> 02:11:03,719
Consolidated worked inside of this

3400
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:06,540
imbalance and into

3401
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:08,460
this breaker

3402
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:12,060
we have a low high lower low less up

3403
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:13,560
close candle extend that in the future

3404
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:17,219
hits it here hits it here

3405
02:11:17,219 --> 02:11:19,139
my eyes don't

3406
02:11:19,139 --> 02:11:21,780
I gotta look at it see

3407
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:23,580
I'm not sure if that one hit it too

3408
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:26,460
you did so it hits it here multiple

3409
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:30,599
times okay now this breaker is not a

3410
02:11:30,599 --> 02:11:32,219
supply and demand Zone

3411
02:11:32,219 --> 02:11:35,340
okay uh Sam seiden and those who follow

3412
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,599
him

3413
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:39,300
if they were to say that as a demand

3414
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,820
Zone okay

3415
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:44,159
now it's no longer fresh it's definitely

3416
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:48,300
stale bread now it's a it's a crouton

3417
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,540
they would never use that logic okay

3418
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:53,580
my PD arrays as long as the narrative

3419
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:55,679
stays intact looking for higher prices

3420
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:58,520
these PD arrays can be

3421
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:01,800
reused okay their their sponsorship

3422
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:04,199
doesn't expire simply because it's

3423
02:12:04,199 --> 02:12:06,920
traded to it before

3424
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,320
we're in a large consolidation here buy

3425
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,659
side here the market rallies up creates

3426
02:12:12,659 --> 02:12:14,219
another area of

3427
02:12:14,219 --> 02:12:16,440
equal highs it drops back down where is

3428
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:19,199
it dropping down into inefficiencies

3429
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:20,219
here

3430
02:12:20,219 --> 02:12:22,860
and look real close you see that right

3431
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:23,940
there

3432
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:26,659
what is that

3433
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:28,739
what is this little thing right there

3434
02:12:28,739 --> 02:12:32,780
I'll give you a second to think about it

3435
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:40,380
okay

3436
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:50,340
what did I tell you es was gonna do

3437
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:52,920
go higher right up into that Gap that's

3438
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:55,139
what this two blue lines are up here

3439
02:12:55,139 --> 02:12:57,480
okay that real liquidity boy which is

3440
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,040
the highest portion of that volume

3441
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,800
imbalance on the weekly chart

3442
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:03,540
so if the Market's going to gravitate up

3443
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,739
to there

3444
02:13:04,739 --> 02:13:07,079
we're not looking for shorts folks so we

3445
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:08,639
wouldn't look at this as a rally up

3446
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:10,020
until it to go short

3447
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:12,420
we don't want to see that so if we can

3448
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:14,520
see it go above it and close above it it

3449
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,380
does it on this candle here but we're on

3450
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:18,179
a four hour chart so it's definitely

3451
02:13:18,179 --> 02:13:19,320
going to do

3452
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,900
a close on an hourly chart or a

3453
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:23,699
15-minute chart but we're going to just

3454
02:13:23,699 --> 02:13:25,260
do a top down

3455
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:27,659
this fair value guy

3456
02:13:27,659 --> 02:13:29,760
would be treated the same way I told you

3457
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,400
I wouldn't want to see the dollar Index

3458
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,159
FVG to be an inversion

3459
02:13:35,159 --> 02:13:37,139
failure fair value yeah

3460
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:39,360
that means that we don't see it go above

3461
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,099
it

3462
02:13:41,099 --> 02:13:43,380
and then treat it as support

3463
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,179
look at the bodies of the candles that's

3464
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:47,880
the narrative that's the the real story

3465
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:50,520
is in the the bodies the Wicks do the

3466
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,560
damage yes we Wicked through it but look

3467
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,699
where it closed

3468
02:13:53,699 --> 02:13:55,619
we traded down look at the body's closed

3469
02:13:55,619 --> 02:13:57,000
right there that's consequent

3470
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,320
encroachment that's the midpoint of that

3471
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:00,060
Gap right there

3472
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:02,960
here I mean

3473
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,320
make it nice and obvious

3474
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,599
so 41.82 and a quarter

3475
02:14:14,599 --> 02:14:18,480
the open on this is 41.82 and a quarter

3476
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,099
oh look at that

3477
02:14:20,099 --> 02:14:21,659
now you're gonna tell me you're gonna

3478
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:23,099
argue with me

3479
02:14:23,099 --> 02:14:26,940
okay uh dollar menu mentor gonna tell me

3480
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,560
that that's buying and selling pressure

3481
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,179
that this happened to make that lineup

3482
02:14:30,179 --> 02:14:32,639
exactly right there really

3483
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:33,900
really

3484
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:37,199
I'm sorry I'm sorry that nobody told you

3485
02:14:37,199 --> 02:14:39,540
in books before me I'm sorry that you

3486
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:41,940
can't find it on your own I'm sorry

3487
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:44,400
but you have it now so stop wrestling

3488
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,739
with me you guys you make arguments

3489
02:14:46,739 --> 02:14:48,420
against me

3490
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:50,460
when I'm telling you something it works

3491
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:52,320
phenomenally and how these markets

3492
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,980
really Book price

3493
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,159
inversion for your bag

3494
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:04,020
if you ever have an inversion fair value

3495
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:08,239
Gap and here's for your notes folks

3496
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:10,560
I was gonna say this for the book but

3497
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,599
I'll give it here today if you have an

3498
02:15:12,599 --> 02:15:15,000
inversion Fairbank yet like that

3499
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,040
and you have a FVG

3500
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:20,280
that's just below that level inside of

3501
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:23,460
your dealing range meaning you have this

3502
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,780
low

3503
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:27,739
to that high

3504
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,599
this inversion fair value got we would

3505
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:31,679
want to see it trade through that

3506
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:33,960
because we're bullish buy side

3507
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,520
this later on we don't know that's going

3508
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,020
to form yet because we're here

3509
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:39,179
it rallies through it

3510
02:15:39,179 --> 02:15:41,099
we expect

3511
02:15:41,099 --> 02:15:43,199
ICT tell me how to know when the fair

3512
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:45,360
Bay gaps shouldn't close in here's one

3513
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,400
of those signatures

3514
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,560
inversion Fair bag you got

3515
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,840
all this area should stay open

3516
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,300
for a portion of it should stay open

3517
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:55,500
okay so in other words it would look

3518
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:57,360
like this this is what you would

3519
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:59,099
anticipate

3520
02:15:59,099 --> 02:16:02,179
as a fair value guy

3521
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:05,699
some of you would see this entry in this

3522
02:16:05,699 --> 02:16:07,260
shaded area here

3523
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,260
some of my students would see this as

3524
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:12,060
their multiplier meaning that they would

3525
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:14,159
go long when price dropped into it right

3526
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:15,960
there

3527
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,880
other students would see this and say

3528
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:22,020
okay I want to see it show me proof with

3529
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:25,139
the bodies respecting either consequent

3530
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:27,000
encroachment or the high of the fair

3531
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,500
value got

3532
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:32,580
is there anybody closing at the high no

3533
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:35,160
we do have a body close right here on

3534
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:36,299
this candle at the consequent

3535
02:16:36,299 --> 02:16:38,519
encroachment as soon as it does that we

3536
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:41,580
now can trust that this area here

3537
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:44,879
should not be traded down into

3538
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:47,638
technical science baby take notes take

3539
02:16:47,638 --> 02:16:50,040
notes Goldman Sachs okay because this is

3540
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:53,099
the real so this rum here goes for

3541
02:16:53,099 --> 02:16:55,500
what it takes out the by side liquidity

3542
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,019
now folks that just simply watch one of

3543
02:16:58,019 --> 02:16:59,939
my videos and they see the relative

3544
02:16:59,939 --> 02:17:01,558
equal highs and relatively close that we

3545
02:17:01,558 --> 02:17:03,660
like to Target we don't look at this as

3546
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:06,120
we can trust this as a short typical

3547
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,820
retail idea we want to see something

3548
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:11,040
that's going to be at a later time

3549
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,320
uses a long to go right back there and

3550
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:15,058
Target those individuals

3551
02:17:15,058 --> 02:17:19,279
so this area here would be a

3552
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:23,120
buy side liquidity pool

3553
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:39,939
[Music]

3554
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:51,179
okay so that will be a first partial if

3555
02:17:51,179 --> 02:17:53,340
a student would use this entry on this

3556
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:55,260
if everybody got they could they could

3557
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:57,780
use this as what specifically what kind

3558
02:17:57,780 --> 02:18:00,179
of Entry would that be

3559
02:18:00,179 --> 02:18:04,460
right in here what entry would that be

3560
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,780
institutional order flow entry drill

3561
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:09,380
meaning

3562
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:12,718
that you're only needing it to go to

3563
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:15,058
that level or just below it of this fair

3564
02:18:15,058 --> 02:18:16,679
value Gap trusting because we have an

3565
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:18,478
inversion FVG here that's

3566
02:18:18,478 --> 02:18:19,978
going to support price if we get a

3567
02:18:19,978 --> 02:18:22,200
signature showing that either one of

3568
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:26,340
these conditions occur a body closes at

3569
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,420
the High

3570
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:30,959
or closes at the constant encroachment

3571
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:33,780
as soon as that happens as soon as that

3572
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:36,058
happens the algorithm will immediately

3573
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:39,120
spool and go the other direction and aim

3574
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,398
for delivery to the upside going after

3575
02:18:41,398 --> 02:18:45,240
buy side or inefficiency above old highs

3576
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,040
buy sides here

3577
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,660
did it look like it wanted to go in a

3578
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:49,740
hurry higher

3579
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:51,179
I mean my chart looks like this does

3580
02:18:51,179 --> 02:18:53,899
yours look like that

3581
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,179
it draws to this area here

3582
02:18:57,179 --> 02:19:00,000
right in here and then what do we get

3583
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,240
open immediate rebalance bang hits it if

3584
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:05,040
you get an immediate rebalance you know

3585
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,718
where it's going to go I told you weeks

3586
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:08,459
ago that was going to go up here

3587
02:19:08,459 --> 02:19:10,200
it's on YouTube it's in Twitter it's all

3588
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:11,638
over the place

3589
02:19:11,638 --> 02:19:13,978
we were going long we were focusing on

3590
02:19:13,978 --> 02:19:18,000
Longs Longs bullish buying long

3591
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,179
where to right here

3592
02:19:21,179 --> 02:19:23,459
right up here

3593
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:25,679
immediate rebalance even though we took

3594
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:27,540
out by side here

3595
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:29,580
guys out there trying to teach Fu

3596
02:19:29,580 --> 02:19:32,099
Candles there are no Fu candles okay

3597
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:34,320
that's not my stuff you want to pretend

3598
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,939
there's a mythological creature out

3599
02:19:35,939 --> 02:19:37,620
there called a Fu candle it's your

3600
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:39,959
business but they'll say okay look at

3601
02:19:39,959 --> 02:19:41,340
this it's running up here now they took

3602
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:44,760
the stops now it's gonna sell off

3603
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,740
no

3604
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,058
how do you know when it's going to take

3605
02:19:48,058 --> 02:19:50,220
out relative equal highs in Reverse or

3606
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:52,320
when it's going to keep continuing when

3607
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,120
you have a HTF PD array

3608
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:56,460
that has yet to be traded to so I'm not

3609
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:57,960
going to look at these equal highs being

3610
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,820
traded to and then reject and go lower

3611
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:02,939
that's just a partial and I'm holding on

3612
02:20:02,939 --> 02:20:05,040
looking for higher prices

3613
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,899
and running into you know higher prices

3614
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:09,240
still

3615
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:11,100
now what happens if it's trading like

3616
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:14,520
this on going into a Friday or Thursday

3617
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:16,200
and we're getting into this area here

3618
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:19,080
but doesn't quite get to the high it

3619
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:21,479
could wait until the next week's Monday

3620
02:20:21,479 --> 02:20:24,240
or if it's a holiday into Tuesday okay

3621
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:26,040
wherever we open up at

3622
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:28,020
all these things have to be weighed out

3623
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:30,780
when you're reading and are trading it's

3624
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:32,340
not to Simply get in there and just hold

3625
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:33,899
it over the weekend because over over

3626
02:20:33,899 --> 02:20:36,060
the weekend there is enormous

3627
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:37,859
Gap risk

3628
02:20:37,859 --> 02:20:44,340
Gap risk is the likelihood of a

3629
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:47,100
opening that is unfavorable to your

3630
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,000
position

3631
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,160
for instance say you're long and you're

3632
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,200
up 80 Handles in a position you're

3633
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,580
holding for ES

3634
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:55,620
it could open up where you're now only

3635
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:57,479
up 40 handles

3636
02:20:57,479 --> 02:21:00,720
or in better scenarios it can open up

3637
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:03,300
and now you're up 120 handles right from

3638
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:04,560
the opening

3639
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,939
and if you get something like that you

3640
02:21:05,939 --> 02:21:07,140
should just take your profits there

3641
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:09,060
because it's likely to come in and close

3642
02:21:09,060 --> 02:21:11,100
in that Gap and you don't know because

3643
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:12,540
you're probably just now learning you

3644
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:13,439
don't know if it's going to fill that

3645
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:15,120
Gap and continue higher or close that

3646
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:16,080
Gap

3647
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:17,640
sputter higher a little bit and then

3648
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,979
Korean lower even still

3649
02:21:19,979 --> 02:21:21,540
so

3650
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:23,340
there's lots of things that you have to

3651
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:27,180
know and by the long drawn out boring

3652
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:29,520
stuff I'm teaching you I'm giving you

3653
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:32,939
all that experience in my dialogue

3654
02:21:32,939 --> 02:21:34,859
that you haven't encountered the reason

3655
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:38,160
for requiring that or leaning on the

3656
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:39,720
necessity of having that information in

3657
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:40,920
the beginning

3658
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,500
most of you have no idea

3659
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:46,680
so and that's why that that effect if

3660
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:49,260
you watch my videos multiple times it

3661
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:51,120
feels like you're watching a brand new

3662
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,220
video when you're paying attention it

3663
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:54,960
sounds like I didn't hear him say that

3664
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:56,160
the first time when the video is the

3665
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:58,200
same one but now it's more meaningful to

3666
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,479
you because you're not trading or you're

3667
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:01,740
doing back testing you have more

3668
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:03,899
experience and you're like oh that's why

3669
02:22:03,899 --> 02:22:06,120
he said that now I understand it you

3670
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,680
can't just watch my videos one time and

3671
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:09,720
I promise you that that is not a reason

3672
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:12,420
for you to run my ad Revenue up okay I

3673
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:13,920
don't care if you watch my videos I

3674
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:15,540
really don't I only put them up there

3675
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:16,920
and I'm not taking them down when I stop

3676
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:19,200
in November they're there to keep people

3677
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:20,700
from wanting to buy it from Jokers out

3678
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:22,380
there trying to sell it because they're

3679
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:24,479
still trying to they're on my YouTube

3680
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:26,939
channel stop trying to fish around for

3681
02:22:26,939 --> 02:22:28,560
the videos the videos that you need are

3682
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:31,319
those and I'm teaching you even more my

3683
02:22:31,319 --> 02:22:32,760
charter members the people that pay me

3684
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:33,960
they're in the audience right now

3685
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:35,580
learning just like you are and the

3686
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:36,540
things I'm talking about right here

3687
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:38,580
they've never learned that

3688
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:41,340
they've never learned this

3689
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:43,500
this is all fresh right from the oven to

3690
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:46,740
buy CT and it's not in your books

3691
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:49,680
so let's go into uh

3692
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,960
let's go into a 15 minute time frame

3693
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:54,140
foreign

3694
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:57,600
but you'll have plenty of things to

3695
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,260
study when I'm going

3696
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:03,120
so we have

3697
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,720
here's today Tuesday Monday okay so

3698
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:07,979
Monday

3699
02:23:07,979 --> 02:23:10,680
Monday was the day we traded up into the

3700
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:13,620
high end of that gap on the weekly chart

3701
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:16,439
okay the Gap is defined by this level is

3702
02:23:16,439 --> 02:23:18,780
the high and this level is the low okay

3703
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:21,780
and

3704
02:23:23,939 --> 02:23:26,880
all through here

3705
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:28,920
see how we ran up in here

3706
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:31,859
this is all non-farm payroll garbage

3707
02:23:31,859 --> 02:23:35,340
this is trashy you know delivery then we

3708
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,300
rally

3709
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:38,700
see how we fell short of that gap on the

3710
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:39,540
weekly

3711
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:41,520
chart it didn't get to the low of it

3712
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:43,740
here and then careened all the way back

3713
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:46,800
down into this down closed candle

3714
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:49,859
and then back and forth

3715
02:23:49,859 --> 02:23:51,660
back and forth

3716
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:55,319
open down one more time this low right

3717
02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:56,040
there

3718
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:58,380
is constical encroachment or just below

3719
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:01,319
it of this Wick

3720
02:24:01,319 --> 02:24:04,800
then it wrong uh rally strongly up into

3721
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,560
the low that Weekly got And Trades up to

3722
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:10,020
consequent encroachment or midpoint of

3723
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:11,040
that

3724
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:15,120
range high and low of the weekly Gap so

3725
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:17,640
think about it like this you ever played

3726
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:21,319
uh the game Who horseshoes

3727
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:25,020
in the U.S we have a game that we take

3728
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:29,340
two steel posts little metal poles and

3729
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:30,960
we beat them down under the ground

3730
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:33,660
and we have real horseshoes

3731
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:35,700
and you stand over there and you got

3732
02:24:35,700 --> 02:24:39,300
typically two horseshoes a player and

3733
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:41,640
you try to toss the Horseshoe and try to

3734
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,920
get it to ring around that that little

3735
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,520
metal post

3736
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,859
think about your trades and where you're

3737
02:24:49,859 --> 02:24:52,859
trying to see price go to okay whether

3738
02:24:52,859 --> 02:24:54,240
or not

3739
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:56,640
you get that horseshoe on that post or

3740
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:58,080
not

3741
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,479
is irrelevant you're aiming for it to go

3742
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:02,399
to that post so you're tossing

3743
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:04,800
horseshoes in that vicinity with the

3744
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,600
expectation that it's going to get a

3745
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,939
ringer okay

3746
02:25:08,939 --> 02:25:11,880
a ringer in this case on that Gap would

3747
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,200
be getting to the high which is what we

3748
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,120
see it trade to on Friday

3749
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:17,460
but is it a losing trade if you got long

3750
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:19,080
and you got out in here

3751
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:23,040
and left it thinking that okay it might

3752
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,260
not trade

3753
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:27,780
you know Friday's afternoon session

3754
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,280
into that high it might leave it till

3755
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:30,420
the next week

3756
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:32,640
I don't think it would be a losing trade

3757
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:33,899
I don't think it would be illusion trade

3758
02:25:33,899 --> 02:25:35,100
at all

3759
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:36,899
and if you stick with that narrative

3760
02:25:36,899 --> 02:25:39,300
that as long as you're tossing trades in

3761
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:42,479
with the expectation that the the

3762
02:25:42,479 --> 02:25:44,220
direction you're aiming your horseshoes

3763
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,140
or your trades or you're trying to take

3764
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:48,420
partials you're trying to reach for

3765
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:51,840
these levels to get paid at you don't

3766
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,819
need a ringer

3767
02:25:53,819 --> 02:25:55,859
to be profitable

3768
02:25:55,859 --> 02:25:59,340
that's this is the right

3769
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:01,319
expression in

3770
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:03,660
your equation for

3771
02:26:03,660 --> 02:26:06,720
successor uh failure you think success

3772
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,399
is only if it goes to the Target you

3773
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:09,720
called for

3774
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:11,280
that's not true

3775
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:15,560
success is making money

3776
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:17,340
success

3777
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:20,160
is being profitable how profitable you

3778
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,420
got more money in your pocket than you

3779
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:23,760
had last week you got more money in your

3780
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,500
account than you had yesterday

3781
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,399
that's success it's modular

3782
02:26:28,399 --> 02:26:31,260
long-term consistency or longevity in

3783
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:35,100
trading is long-term profitability that

3784
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:36,960
will absolutely have periods of drawdown

3785
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,479
where you're losing trades and that's

3786
02:26:39,479 --> 02:26:40,920
okay you

3787
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,899
limit your risk cut your business size

3788
02:26:42,899 --> 02:26:44,939
in half each time you take a loss and

3789
02:26:44,939 --> 02:26:46,920
you try to get 50 of the previous loss

3790
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:49,080
you got and once you get that they can

3791
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:51,540
go back to a little bit higher risk a

3792
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:53,340
little bit higher risk

3793
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:56,760
going slow in the beginning is important

3794
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:59,160
but keep in the proper perspective and

3795
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:00,780
what you're looking for in PA

3796
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:02,760
where is it going how should you expect

3797
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:04,680
price to deliver I've covered all that

3798
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,760
today

3799
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,859
I covered how how a price should deliver

3800
02:27:07,859 --> 02:27:10,080
I showed you where it was going to go I

3801
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,340
told you specifically where I was going

3802
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:12,960
to go weeks ago

3803
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:15,120
and we got it here Friday

3804
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,680
now is it

3805
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:23,240
okay I'm on a 15. is it

3806
02:27:25,050 --> 02:27:28,110
[Music]

3807
02:27:30,859 --> 02:27:33,540
today let's go into

3808
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:36,620
Thursday Friday

3809
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,319
okay so here's

3810
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:45,960
current new week opening Gap very very

3811
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:50,479
small little tiny little opening Gap

3812
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:57,540
did it gravitate back to it

3813
02:27:57,540 --> 02:28:00,140
yes

3814
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:02,399
new week opening gaps are like that

3815
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:05,760
little Post in the game of horseshoes

3816
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,399
you don't need it to be a ringer

3817
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:11,280
but it's your everybody in smart money

3818
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:13,080
is aiming for that

3819
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,479
okay we're consolidating consolidating

3820
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:17,160
consolidating and then we broke lower

3821
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:19,920
trapping Traders going short why because

3822
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,899
they think it's gone up too long it has

3823
02:28:21,899 --> 02:28:24,180
to be going lower so sell side has been

3824
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:26,819
taken the Trap Traders short rallies

3825
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:29,220
small little Gap trades down into it

3826
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:31,380
here but we gravitate back to that new

3827
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:33,600
week opening Gap

3828
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:35,640
go back over here

3829
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:37,080
you see this little section of price

3830
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:38,520
action here

3831
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:41,040
if this stays open

3832
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,319
and we take out that low then we're

3833
02:28:43,319 --> 02:28:45,660
going lower until that I'm staying

3834
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,280
bullish on ES

3835
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:49,439
simple as that

3836
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:51,780
very simple right it's not complicated

3837
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:55,020
it's not you know making something

3838
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:58,340
bloated with uh

3839
02:28:58,439 --> 02:29:00,840
assuming moving parts

3840
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:03,359
and we don't need this level and you're

3841
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:05,280
probably saying what is that level

3842
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,420
to be honest I don't remember off the

3843
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:07,859
top and hit what it is I don't have my

3844
02:29:07,859 --> 02:29:09,300
notes next to me so

3845
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:11,160
the uh

3846
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:13,020
below the Gap and the high of the Gap

3847
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:15,240
here

3848
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:18,500
and new week opening Gap

3849
02:29:27,479 --> 02:29:29,640
all right so here's the third uh was it

3850
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:30,840
Thursday

3851
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:33,660
Friday Friday

3852
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:34,920
post

3853
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:37,140
non-farm payroll

3854
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:40,979
we have a gap in here

3855
02:29:40,979 --> 02:29:43,140
if we're bullish

3856
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:46,080
okay if we're bullish

3857
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:48,180
are we looking for premium fair value

3858
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:51,120
gaps to sell short from

3859
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:53,460
hopefully you've been watching this

3860
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:55,979
live stream close to nothing though that

3861
02:29:55,979 --> 02:29:57,479
that's not what we want

3862
02:29:57,479 --> 02:30:01,859
so how do I know when to anticipate a

3863
02:30:01,859 --> 02:30:03,359
FVG to perform as an

3864
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:05,280
inversion Fair Vega you have to have

3865
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:06,899
narrative

3866
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:08,939
where are you

3867
02:30:08,939 --> 02:30:11,819
are you looking for bullish or bearish

3868
02:30:11,819 --> 02:30:14,880
is the market has the market traded to

3869
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:18,120
your HTF DOL

3870
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:21,120
that's this here that's that gap on the

3871
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:23,220
weekly chart

3872
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:27,740
so if we see a gap like this here

3873
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,319
right here

3874
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:39,600
[Music]

3875
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:43,140
everybody else would see that as a

3876
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:45,060
return into that let's go short and go

3877
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:45,780
lower

3878
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:47,640
now

3879
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:50,460
if we see things like this

3880
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:53,220
that already should tell you no

3881
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:55,439
because this drop down here was this get

3882
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:57,420
sell stops taken

3883
02:30:57,420 --> 02:31:00,420
and either put Traders short

3884
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:02,880
or take them out of their lungs

3885
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:04,740
then we have a market structure shift

3886
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:07,040
here

3887
02:31:07,740 --> 02:31:10,560
we have a gap here and I love seeing

3888
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,720
gaps that would look like some kind of

3889
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:14,040
uh let me change the color here it's

3890
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:16,760
sponky

3891
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:24,920
all right so

3892
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:30,899
everything we have this Gap in here

3893
02:31:30,899 --> 02:31:33,840
that Gap when it trades up into it there

3894
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:36,600
if you are just a casual viewer Netflix

3895
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:39,840
and chill type of uh ICT student you're

3896
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,040
going to get tripped up and you're gonna

3897
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:42,960
be like the Joker I just blocked on my

3898
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:44,580
YouTube channel that was posting stuff

3899
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:47,040
saying this stuff doesn't work it only

3900
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,920
works sometimes this is nonsense folks

3901
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:53,700
listen okay if you can't make it work

3902
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,859
that's where it stops where you can't

3903
02:31:55,859 --> 02:31:57,600
make it work you haven't done enough

3904
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:00,540
study to learn it yet but it's always

3905
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,300
there the Silver Bullet is every day

3906
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:06,359
in the times I've told you and the

3907
02:32:06,359 --> 02:32:07,200
things I'm teaching with Market

3908
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:09,000
structure shifts and draws on liquidity

3909
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,859
which is the most Paramount lesson

3910
02:32:10,859 --> 02:32:13,620
that's the thing you need to know up in

3911
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:15,240
here

3912
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,399
halfway point

3913
02:32:17,399 --> 02:32:19,500
consequent approach between the high and

3914
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:21,600
the low of that Weekly Gap

3915
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:23,460
think about that analogy I just gave you

3916
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:26,460
with the game of horseshoes okay

3917
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:29,340
midpoint is a real good Target

3918
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:31,200
real good Target

3919
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:34,080
best a perfect ringer would be at the

3920
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,220
high end

3921
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:37,979
but we're consolidating in here

3922
02:32:37,979 --> 02:32:40,620
and we closed on Friday right around

3923
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:43,080
here so we're consolidating at 4 30.

3924
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,640
what's the likelihood of it getting up

3925
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,160
into that high

3926
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:49,500
to close that Gap in

3927
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,180
very very low

3928
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:53,700
very very low because we're going into

3929
02:32:53,700 --> 02:32:55,140
the close and we're going into the

3930
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:56,580
Friday close

3931
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:58,140
so they're going to leave that portion

3932
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:01,200
open and trade it in Monday indoor

3933
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:03,240
Tuesday

3934
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:05,340
so you would stay bullish until it hits

3935
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:08,100
this level then once it happens

3936
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,960
you go neutral

3937
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:12,540
you sit still

3938
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:15,180
not what do we do next what do we trade

3939
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:18,060
next you trade sidelines

3940
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:20,160
that wins all the time you can't lose

3941
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:22,140
money on the sidelines that is a

3942
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:24,960
position not trading is a position not

3943
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,000
being long not being short neutral on

3944
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,580
the sidelines no risk incurred that is a

3945
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:32,399
position and it always always is

3946
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:33,720
profitable it means you have the same

3947
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:34,859
amount of money in your account on the

3948
02:33:34,859 --> 02:33:37,500
day ends that you had when you started

3949
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:39,240
I don't know why it's such a hard thing

3950
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,160
for people to sit still they always have

3951
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:42,300
to be doing something because day

3952
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:43,800
trading is everyday trading to them and

3953
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:46,800
it's not to a professional it's not it's

3954
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:49,140
absolutely not

3955
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:50,960
thank you

3956
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:54,420
so when you see things like this and you

3957
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,760
anticipate that a FVG would

3958
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:58,800
become a inversion Fairbank

3959
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:00,240
weaning we would not we would want to

3960
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,800
see price

3961
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:05,040
trade above come back down in and then

3962
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:07,560
rally we want to see that

3963
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:09,540
and if we don't see that

3964
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,800
we do nothing

3965
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,660
because the bullish narrative that we're

3966
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:15,479
holding see in your mind

3967
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:18,000
or in my mind

3968
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,220
we fell short of that low of the gap on

3969
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:21,600
the weekly chart which is this level

3970
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:23,640
here and this is where I'm thinking

3971
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:26,399
price is going to gravitate towards it's

3972
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:28,260
going to go up there so all smart

3973
02:34:28,260 --> 02:34:30,060
money's doing is keeps throwing

3974
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:32,340
horseshoes until it gets up in this area

3975
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:35,880
here every retracement every discount is

3976
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,740
an opportunity for a high frequency

3977
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:41,040
trading algorithm to go long

3978
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:44,060
what did I just say yes

3979
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:47,880
every single short term discount

3980
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:51,540
PD array is utilized by high frequency

3981
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:54,960
trading algorithms to go long and then

3982
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:57,960
throw their orders into this Abyss

3983
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:00,660
up in here in this area up here because

3984
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:03,180
that inefficiency that the average bear

3985
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:04,800
the average Trader I shouldn't say bear

3986
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:06,500
because I'm not saying difference to

3987
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:08,760
 bears but the average person

3988
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:10,800
the average Trader doesn't think like

3989
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:12,240
I'm teaching you they're not even aware

3990
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,160
of that volume and balance they weren't

3991
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:15,780
even looking at that they're arguing

3992
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:17,819
with me why are you looking at gaps when

3993
02:35:17,819 --> 02:35:19,439
the trade when trading during that time

3994
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:20,760
that wasn't the front month contract

3995
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:22,260
blah blah blah that's exactly the reason

3996
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:24,000
why it works

3997
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,680
wake up

3998
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:27,899
what are you doing arm wrestling me when

3999
02:35:27,899 --> 02:35:29,040
I'm telling you what works and it

4000
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:29,880
happens

4001
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:32,160
like I don't agree with this so

4002
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:33,899
therefore let me argue about it instead

4003
02:35:33,899 --> 02:35:35,399
of saying wow this works let me

4004
02:35:35,399 --> 02:35:37,439
just keep doing what he's showing

4005
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:39,540
that's what I'm trying to convey

4006
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:42,180
but it's like there's a number of you

4007
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:44,220
that don't want to learn you want to

4008
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:46,500
argue you want to debate I'm not here to

4009
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:48,000
 debate I'm here to show you how

4010
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,140
to make money and get the out of

4011
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:50,760
Dodge in November I'm getting back to

4012
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:53,040
enjoying my life

4013
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,840
but you're wasting time all this

4014
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:56,880
nonsense of arguing and saying this

4015
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:57,960
doesn't work that doesn't work because

4016
02:35:57,960 --> 02:36:01,140
you did five examples casually you got

4017
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:02,939
to put your yourself in from these

4018
02:36:02,939 --> 02:36:05,040
charts and really dig into it

4019
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,200
you have to really make an effort to

4020
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:09,180
learn this and give yourself permission

4021
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,380
and notice it's going to take you longer

4022
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:11,939
than you probably thought

4023
02:36:11,939 --> 02:36:15,000
but there are people out there that are

4024
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,479
absolutely murdering it

4025
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:20,280
murdering it they've never made this

4026
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,560
kind of money in their life before ever

4027
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:24,000
and they had the same thoughts you're

4028
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,479
holding right now what if I can't do it

4029
02:36:27,479 --> 02:36:30,300
what if I can't make this work for me

4030
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:32,760
I've done all this study what happens if

4031
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:35,220
I fail what happens if you just keep

4032
02:36:35,220 --> 02:36:36,540
going

4033
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:38,939
because that's what happened for them

4034
02:36:38,939 --> 02:36:41,580
they did the work they stayed at it they

4035
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:42,780
didn't talk themselves out of it they

4036
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:43,920
didn't let other people on the internet

4037
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:45,899
talk them out of it

4038
02:36:45,899 --> 02:36:47,520
you roll your sleeves up say you know

4039
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:49,439
what this stuff works it only feels

4040
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:50,880
complicated right now because I'm brand

4041
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:51,660
new

4042
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:53,220
and now I'm going to sit down and be

4043
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:54,840
disciplined I'm gonna put myself in

4044
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:58,020
there and show myself that I can do this

4045
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:59,100
okay

4046
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:02,760
uh the rage right now is the the funded

4047
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:05,120
accounts of 50 what was it 150 000

4048
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:08,040
funded accounts okay

4049
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:09,240
um

4050
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:11,040
Trading

4051
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:12,600
let's just say for instance let's play

4052
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:15,300
devil's advocate for a moment okay

4053
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:17,100
let's say for instance that you've done

4054
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:19,020
the work you spend the full calendar

4055
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:21,540
year doing everything I tell you to do

4056
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:23,340
I mean think about it some of you are in

4057
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:24,840
college or you went to college you

4058
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:27,020
submitted to four years of

4059
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:28,859
ninety percent of the things you learned

4060
02:37:28,859 --> 02:37:30,479
in college you don't even use in your

4061
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:32,640
career that's just the truth okay I

4062
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:35,040
don't care where you are

4063
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,080
the fact that you were willing to put

4064
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:39,060
that much time into something and

4065
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:41,040
probably paid for it and probably still

4066
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:42,780
paying the loan payments that you can't

4067
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:45,000
even file bankruptcy for if you go broke

4068
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,460
you you are having to pay that whether

4069
02:37:47,460 --> 02:37:49,740
you're doing that job or not

4070
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:51,960
all that effort and time that you were

4071
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:53,640
willing to put yourself through for four

4072
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,140
years with no certainty that you're even

4073
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:56,280
gonna love what you're going to school

4074
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,840
for

4075
02:37:57,840 --> 02:37:59,880
if you don't love the opportunity that

4076
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:01,380
these markets present

4077
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:03,540
don't touch them

4078
02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:05,700
don't trade don't learn the trade don't

4079
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:08,640
do it if you are not 100 convinced that

4080
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:11,000
this is for you

4081
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
do not touch these these markets period

4082
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,100
don't let anybody entice you into

4083
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:18,300
thinking that you can learn their easy

4084
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:20,520
Black Box this that no thing if you're

4085
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:22,560
not absolutely convinced that this is

4086
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:26,939
for you do not go any further stop you

4087
02:38:26,939 --> 02:38:30,300
will save so much pain misery probably

4088
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:32,720
money

4089
02:38:33,479 --> 02:38:36,359
if you're not 100 convinced that this is

4090
02:38:36,359 --> 02:38:38,520
what you see yourself doing

4091
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:40,620
don't touch it

4092
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:42,600
because you can't be lukewarm half-ass

4093
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:44,280
go in here and think I'm going to try to

4094
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:46,319
dabble with it dabbling always gets your

4095
02:38:46,319 --> 02:38:48,979
fingers burned

4096
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:52,680
you're gonna lose money

4097
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:54,660
you're gonna make money if you stay with

4098
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:56,399
it long enough but it's always going to

4099
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:58,260
be a give and take

4100
02:38:58,260 --> 02:39:00,359
you're never going to be perfect you

4101
02:39:00,359 --> 02:39:02,280
don't have to be perfect you just need

4102
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:04,680
to be profitable and I teach with a demo

4103
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:06,300
account to desensitize yourself about

4104
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,040
being right or wrong

4105
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:09,960
no other Mentor out there stands out

4106
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:11,640
there championing the fact that it's

4107
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:14,160
demo but everybody else has to sell

4108
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,140
they have a problem with me because they

4109
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:18,840
think that that reduces the efficacy the

4110
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:20,399
what does I do and teach and my students

4111
02:39:20,399 --> 02:39:22,560
are making money with it

4112
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,420
what would you do if you made three

4113
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:25,680
hundred thousand dollars in the last

4114
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,660
three months do you think that you would

4115
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:29,460
believe anything anybody else has to say

4116
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:31,740
about what you're doing that would be

4117
02:39:31,740 --> 02:39:34,080
contrary to it hell no you ain't gonna

4118
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:35,700
give a you ain't gonna care what

4119
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:37,800
anybody says nobody in your family

4120
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:40,080
nobody at your job nobody that you know

4121
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:42,540
nobody on the Internet is ever going to

4122
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,280
be able to talk you out of what you have

4123
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:46,800
now masked for yourself and that's a

4124
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,300
skill set that you carry with you as

4125
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:50,040
long as the days are long and you can

4126
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:50,880
breathe

4127
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:53,040
and your mental faculties are there you

4128
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:54,899
have that skill set nobody can take it

4129
02:39:54,899 --> 02:39:57,540
from you nobody

4130
02:39:57,540 --> 02:40:00,000
and you're gonna let some Tom Dick or

4131
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,640
Harry on the internet tell you don't do

4132
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:04,740
that it's a scam when you're seeing

4133
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:06,120
people being interviewed by funded

4134
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:07,319
companies I don't own these

4135
02:40:07,319 --> 02:40:09,120
companies I have no affiliation with

4136
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:10,620
none of them and they're all saying that

4137
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:12,240
the number one group of traders that are

4138
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:14,280
making money at their places are my

4139
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,200
students that should be your testimony

4140
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:17,700
right there if you've ever been sitting

4141
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:19,500
on the fence and thinking should I do

4142
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:21,060
this should I put the effort in these

4143
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:22,319
people are convinced they did the right

4144
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:24,500
thing

4145
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:26,520
these funded companies

4146
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:31,040
love my students they love them

4147
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:34,020
who's next who's next

4148
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:36,600
you sit down you learn a skill set okay

4149
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,180
you learn this skill set

4150
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:40,800
you get comfortable in yourself you're

4151
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:42,359
not recklessly trying to go out and take

4152
02:40:42,359 --> 02:40:43,740
a trade

4153
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:45,060
one of the questions that came up that

4154
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:47,580
let me cover it how do I know when I can

4155
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:49,680
go for a funded account challenge when

4156
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,359
should I transition into live fund

4157
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:52,979
trading

4158
02:40:52,979 --> 02:40:55,080
minimum expectation

4159
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:58,580
and threshold is for you to be

4160
02:40:58,580 --> 02:41:02,520
completely devoid of any kind of bubbly

4161
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:03,960
feeling when you're when you do it right

4162
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:06,240
and you made money in your demo or

4163
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:07,200
whatever

4164
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,800
if you don't feel any kind of emotion

4165
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:13,500
like it's just I mean I've been doing

4166
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:16,319
this for months it's the same stuff I

4167
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:19,080
don't feel any attachment to the outcome

4168
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:21,479
I don't care that it was right I don't

4169
02:41:21,479 --> 02:41:24,000
care that it would exactly like I

4170
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,280
expected to

4171
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:28,319
if you're not in a rush to do something

4172
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:30,540
every single day look at the live

4173
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:31,920
streamers on YouTube

4174
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:33,720
they're out there pressing all the time

4175
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:35,580
they have to perform

4176
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:37,680
like dancing bears they got to do

4177
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:39,540
something for Their audience

4178
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:42,600
if you can sit still and say I don't

4179
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:44,640
need a trade right now and you let the

4180
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:46,979
market pan around and it moves a lot and

4181
02:41:46,979 --> 02:41:49,380
you feel no regret

4182
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:51,660
all the things I just said

4183
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:54,479
and you're consistent in a demo minimum

4184
02:41:54,479 --> 02:41:55,680
six months

4185
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,840
minimum six months

4186
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:59,640
better traders that have been doing for

4187
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:01,560
a longer time if they're consistent like

4188
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:02,580
for instance say you're a profitable

4189
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:06,060
Trader and you learn from me and now you

4190
02:42:06,060 --> 02:42:08,340
you supercharge your Trading

4191
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:10,979
practice in a demo for three months but

4192
02:42:10,979 --> 02:42:12,840
if you are not profitable trading in

4193
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:15,060
general before coming to me

4194
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:16,680
you have to do at least six months in

4195
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:19,560
demo but at the end of that six months

4196
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:21,780
you need to be completely desensitized

4197
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:23,880
to the outcome you don't care

4198
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,920
you don't care you don't feel no there's

4199
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:27,180
no rush that you got to get in there

4200
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:29,040
you're not salivating on Saturday you

4201
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,380
can't wait till Monday

4202
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:33,000
that means you're an action Hound you're

4203
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,100
you're you're all hopped up on goofballs

4204
02:42:35,100 --> 02:42:36,540
because you're gambling

4205
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,939
you're not trading you're gambling and

4206
02:42:38,939 --> 02:42:40,800
you just want to have that outcome to

4207
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:42,600
make you feel significant again

4208
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:44,100
you don't want to have that if you're

4209
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:45,300
thinking like that or feeling like that

4210
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,460
do not do a combine challenge don't try

4211
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:48,899
to do a funded account because you're

4212
02:42:48,899 --> 02:42:52,620
emotionally charged you will fail it

4213
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:55,319
and it will set you back that's mental

4214
02:42:55,319 --> 02:42:58,080
scar tissue and it builds into a callus

4215
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:00,240
and eventually you won't want to do this

4216
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,920
because it's too painful

4217
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:05,040
when all of it is available to you every

4218
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:06,240
single one of you that are listening to

4219
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,680
me right now whether it's recorded and

4220
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:09,300
you've watched it later on down the road

4221
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,040
or right here live

4222
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,439
you can do this

4223
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:16,319
you absolutely can do it

4224
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:19,260
I'm telling you you can do this if I

4225
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:21,780
didn't believe it I wouldn't tell you

4226
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:23,399
and you're now seeing other people

4227
02:43:23,399 --> 02:43:26,460
around the world doing extremely well

4228
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:30,300
and I'm so proud I'm proud to be a small

4229
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:33,000
conduit to the bridge where they were

4230
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,620
and their Newfound success and I'm

4231
02:43:34,620 --> 02:43:35,580
excited to see where they're going to go

4232
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:36,780
I'm excited to see where you're going to

4233
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:38,520
go

4234
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,560
but if you're not passionate about this

4235
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:42,840
if you don't absolutely I mean listen

4236
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:45,300
I'm not selling you a timeshare folks

4237
02:43:45,300 --> 02:43:48,420
okay there's no upsell later on you're

4238
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:50,520
never going to send me any money

4239
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:52,080
and I have more faith than you

4240
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,340
succeeding than you probably do in

4241
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:55,520
yourself

4242
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:58,920
don't sell yourself short

4243
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:00,300
it's going to take work it's going to

4244
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:01,859
take effort but let's assume for a

4245
02:44:01,859 --> 02:44:03,420
moment let's just save her argument's

4246
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:04,979
sake that you did everything I told you

4247
02:44:04,979 --> 02:44:06,000
to do

4248
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,280
and we're at that six month threshold

4249
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:11,100
and you've spent time trading and you

4250
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:11,939
don't feel like you have to be in front

4251
02:44:11,939 --> 02:44:13,020
of the charts every single day you just

4252
02:44:13,020 --> 02:44:14,399
know what you're looking for you know

4253
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:15,720
your model you know what you're trying

4254
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:17,160
to trade on and it just happens to be

4255
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:19,920
there and you take those trades

4256
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:22,920
you're at the funded portion okay you

4257
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:24,780
don't need any money like big big

4258
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:27,000
account size money and you went the

4259
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,979
route that the shoestring budget you can

4260
02:44:28,979 --> 02:44:30,899
afford the funded account stuff

4261
02:44:30,899 --> 02:44:34,319
and you got a 150 000 account

4262
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:37,560
okay 150 000 account you're funded

4263
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:38,640
you're doing the things that I'm

4264
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:40,260
teaching you to do and you're using the

4265
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:42,800
logic I'm showing you here

4266
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:46,560
this is Friday okay inversion fair value

4267
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,520
got

4268
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:50,640
trading and tossing the orders up into

4269
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:54,240
this Gap that Weekly Gap and then every

4270
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:55,500
discount

4271
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:57,479
every short term discount what does that

4272
02:44:57,479 --> 02:44:58,979
mean

4273
02:44:58,979 --> 02:45:02,180
what's this level right here

4274
02:45:02,399 --> 02:45:06,300
this took 25 level of this range from

4275
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:08,280
high to low these two levels again are

4276
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:11,460
that Weekly Gap

4277
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:12,840
so we can

4278
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:15,479
throw gradient levels in there

4279
02:45:15,479 --> 02:45:18,020
25

4280
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:22,500
75. look at the beautiful reaction there

4281
02:45:22,500 --> 02:45:25,500
look out hovered around equilibrium see

4282
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:27,660
that and then closing on the week

4283
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:30,000
two positions

4284
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,560
scaling

4285
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:36,000
long another longs partials

4286
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,939
partial and then stop down

4287
02:45:38,939 --> 02:45:41,399
all of this

4288
02:45:41,399 --> 02:45:43,979
idea of I'm trying to make a lot of

4289
02:45:43,979 --> 02:45:46,140
money in a short period of time

4290
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,140
that needs to go away too

4291
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:51,120
I want to get a better payout than the

4292
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:53,100
last guy I saw on the leaderboard of

4293
02:45:53,100 --> 02:45:54,560
ftml

4294
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:59,340
or my funded Trader or TOP Step or

4295
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:01,680
whatever I don't know all the companies

4296
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:03,300
I guess I have no affiliation with none

4297
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:04,920
of them but

4298
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:06,660
foreign

4299
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:09,540
you're doing this to make money you're

4300
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:11,520
following the logic you're doing all the

4301
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:13,560
things that you're expected to do based

4302
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:15,600
on the things I'm teaching you

4303
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:16,740
if

4304
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:18,840
you do those types of things and you

4305
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:21,000
stick within the narrative that I share

4306
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,040
with my experience when I sit down with

4307
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:25,859
you either on Twitter or in these videos

4308
02:46:25,859 --> 02:46:28,020
where I do analysis or I show you where

4309
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:30,000
I think it's going to go next right now

4310
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,880
we're at a point where I'm neutral

4311
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:35,939
I'm neutral my targets have been met

4312
02:46:35,939 --> 02:46:38,700
so I sit still and I let let the market

4313
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:41,700
then dictate to me what I want to do

4314
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:43,620
next because it's already done it's

4315
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:45,840
quarterly moved for me

4316
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:48,060
it might continue higher or it might

4317
02:46:48,060 --> 02:46:50,760
reverse at this point I don't have an

4318
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:53,160
opinion that's Hardline enough for me to

4319
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:54,600
say I'm going to take a trade in this

4320
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:57,240
direction I don't have a Target next

4321
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:00,180
and I want you to grow comfortable in

4322
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:02,040
those periods

4323
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:03,840
because these periods here where

4324
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,120
everybody blows their account

4325
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:09,180
the folks that go out and say all right

4326
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:11,939
now what next what what next

4327
02:47:11,939 --> 02:47:13,740
they are the ones that will absolutely

4328
02:47:13,740 --> 02:47:15,720
fail they're blowing their

4329
02:47:15,720 --> 02:47:18,240
demo accounts they will never pass a

4330
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:19,859
funded account challenge

4331
02:47:19,859 --> 02:47:21,479
they won't hold a funded account

4332
02:47:21,479 --> 02:47:24,300
challenge in profit you know wherever

4333
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:25,800
the stage is where you whatever you do

4334
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:28,319
in the future you can do a profit split

4335
02:47:28,319 --> 02:47:30,359
if they get to that point they will blow

4336
02:47:30,359 --> 02:47:32,939
it they're they're constantly trying to

4337
02:47:32,939 --> 02:47:34,979
do something else they are not

4338
02:47:34,979 --> 02:47:37,080
comfortable in between trades they're

4339
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:40,979
not and if that's how you feel

4340
02:47:40,979 --> 02:47:43,380
you have to work that out and these are

4341
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:45,359
the periods where I sit still I'm

4342
02:47:45,359 --> 02:47:47,100
content

4343
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:49,140
I'm content I murdered it on a higher

4344
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:50,460
time frame weekly and daily chart for

4345
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:51,899
you and for the folks that want to see

4346
02:47:51,899 --> 02:47:53,939
swing trade ideas where it's going to go

4347
02:47:53,939 --> 02:47:55,500
in the HTFs well there you

4348
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:57,899
go over a thousand handles

4349
02:47:57,899 --> 02:48:00,120
in NASDAQ

4350
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:02,040
and however many Hunter handles or so

4351
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,660
and uh

4352
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:06,620
e-mini s p

4353
02:48:06,660 --> 02:48:08,640
what did you do with the information

4354
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:09,899
how did you use it what are you going to

4355
02:48:09,899 --> 02:48:10,979
do with it now at the end of this live

4356
02:48:10,979 --> 02:48:13,560
stream in five minutes

4357
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:15,780
and like oh I watched this and he could

4358
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:17,100
have said some things in five minutes

4359
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:18,960
and not wasted my time you're never

4360
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:20,520
going to be a profitable Trader if

4361
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:21,720
you're thinking like that

4362
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:23,640
because I'm telling you I would have

4363
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:26,160
paid money to sit in something like this

4364
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:28,319
today when I first started

4365
02:48:28,319 --> 02:48:33,479
I would have gladly spent money for this

4366
02:48:33,479 --> 02:48:35,460
because it wasn't ever in any of the

4367
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:37,439
books and courses I bought it was not

4368
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:39,479
there none of this stuff was out there

4369
02:48:39,479 --> 02:48:41,220
none of these things

4370
02:48:41,220 --> 02:48:42,960
you're hearing it from The Source these

4371
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:45,000
These are these are Concepts that were

4372
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,120
never meant to be in your hands they

4373
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:49,560
were never meant to be understood by the

4374
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:51,600
public

4375
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:53,220
that's why they work so good because

4376
02:48:53,220 --> 02:48:57,500
it's the market it's the market

4377
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:07,979
if you had a hundred 150 000 or 100 000

4378
02:49:07,979 --> 02:49:09,780
account so you did the threshold of a

4379
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:13,200
hundred thousand whatever that is okay

4380
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:15,359
and you did the work

4381
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:17,880
of following the logic

4382
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:20,520
doing what is necessary and you traded

4383
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:22,680
when the setups were there not during

4384
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:25,080
non-farm payroll okay and I'm answering

4385
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:28,080
this too because people say ICT says

4386
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,180
don't trade on non-farm payroll Fridays

4387
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:31,740
and I made this much money and I made

4388
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:33,720
that much money and blah blah

4389
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:35,040
no

4390
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:39,120
I say that new students new Traders new

4391
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:42,479
developing Minds in these markets should

4392
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:47,060
absolutely not trade on non-farm payroll

4393
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:50,399
nobody should be trading during the hour

4394
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:54,240
of non-farm payroll period

4395
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,520
you can and I've done this before I've

4396
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:58,560
shown you executions and recorded did a

4397
02:49:58,560 --> 02:49:59,340
whole thing

4398
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:02,220
I did live sessions I've done sessions

4399
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:04,620
with my private group everybody knows I

4400
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:07,020
can trade on non-farm payroll okay I

4401
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:08,340
don't need to be out here dancing for

4402
02:50:08,340 --> 02:50:09,840
the people that want me to dance for

4403
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,819
them I don't owe you anything

4404
02:50:11,819 --> 02:50:13,740
what I'm giving you is the Insight on

4405
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:15,300
how to do it so if you want to trade on

4406
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:18,660
non-farm payroll Friday say you want to

4407
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:20,280
you do the things I just talked about

4408
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:22,200
here you wait

4409
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:24,899
you wait until it

4410
02:50:24,899 --> 02:50:26,939
gets all the initial volatility in the

4411
02:50:26,939 --> 02:50:29,399
marketplace and as long as the objective

4412
02:50:29,399 --> 02:50:30,840
that you're looking for on a higher time

4413
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:32,880
frame chart the daily

4414
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:34,680
whether it be buy side liquidity or sell

4415
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,840
side liquidity or a premium fair value

4416
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:38,280
or a discount for everybody you got

4417
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:40,979
they're the only four outcomes

4418
02:50:40,979 --> 02:50:43,979
and you're saying that's a complication

4419
02:50:43,979 --> 02:50:45,899
really

4420
02:50:45,899 --> 02:50:47,760
what do you use to get into a trade

4421
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:49,859
right now that's made you lose money

4422
02:50:49,859 --> 02:50:51,300
consistently but you're still holding on

4423
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:53,640
to it thinking it's going to turn around

4424
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:55,560
to turn into some

4425
02:50:55,560 --> 02:50:57,300
Golden Goose for you that lays golden

4426
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,520
eggs because I did all that stuff when I

4427
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:00,540
was younger

4428
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:03,660
I did all that same stuff folks

4429
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:06,240
and I learned by losing lots of money

4430
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:08,700
losing lots of accounts I've blown

4431
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:10,859
dozens of accounts

4432
02:51:10,859 --> 02:51:14,760
I've done that okay and it took lots of

4433
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:16,859
them for me to realize that I was not

4434
02:51:16,859 --> 02:51:19,680
going to Beat It by being tenacious

4435
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:21,899
I had to stop doing all these retail

4436
02:51:21,899 --> 02:51:23,220
things that I kept buying books and

4437
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:24,600
courses with

4438
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:26,520
when I took myself away from all that

4439
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:29,340
stuff and said okay

4440
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:31,260
somebody's winning

4441
02:51:31,260 --> 02:51:33,899
every time I'm losing somebody is

4442
02:51:33,899 --> 02:51:36,000
winning what would they be seeing in

4443
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,100
price and that was the start of what I

4444
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:40,380
was setting myself up for to be who I am

4445
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:42,180
today and a circle Trader

4446
02:51:42,180 --> 02:51:44,760
when you have an understanding of that

4447
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:46,920
statistical probabilities state that the

4448
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:49,260
average Trader you know is probably in

4449
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:51,180
ill-informed they have no idea what

4450
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:52,800
they're doing and I apologize my dogs

4451
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:54,180
are going crazy

4452
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:55,680
they probably see something outside of

4453
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:57,660
like a deer or something

4454
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:59,220
you sort of Saw Bailey this morning she

4455
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:00,899
was freaking out we opened her pool up

4456
02:52:00,899 --> 02:52:02,640
yesterday because it's been really cool

4457
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:03,800
in Maryland

4458
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:06,720
unseasonably cool but there's two toads

4459
02:52:06,720 --> 02:52:07,859
swimming around and I had to fish them

4460
02:52:07,859 --> 02:52:10,439
out I can't run it to the bottom and she

4461
02:52:10,439 --> 02:52:12,240
doesn't like getting baths but she was

4462
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:13,979
really looking like she wanted to jump

4463
02:52:13,979 --> 02:52:15,540
in there so

4464
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:17,760
anyway Bella's doing better thank you

4465
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,439
for your concern

4466
02:52:19,439 --> 02:52:21,479
but here's an example

4467
02:52:21,479 --> 02:52:23,399
of if you know what you're doing you

4468
02:52:23,399 --> 02:52:24,840
know what you're looking for

4469
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:26,880
and you just want to have one trading

4470
02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:29,279
opportunity where you work your magic

4471
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:31,380
one day and stop

4472
02:52:31,380 --> 02:52:33,899
do nothing else but you're staying with

4473
02:52:33,899 --> 02:52:35,399
the ideas that I'm teaching you from a

4474
02:52:35,399 --> 02:52:37,380
HTF basis

4475
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:40,279
using the idea of liquidity and

4476
02:52:40,279 --> 02:52:42,600
inefficiencies sticking with a higher

4477
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:44,220
time frame bias

4478
02:52:44,220 --> 02:52:47,779
only trading in that model looking for

4479
02:52:47,779 --> 02:52:49,859
inefficiencies on HTF

4480
02:52:49,859 --> 02:52:53,700
charts where large pools of buying and

4481
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:56,580
selling will occur from the aspect of

4482
02:52:56,580 --> 02:52:59,580
smart money which isn't in books you

4483
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,859
know the logic that they use to buy and

4484
02:53:01,859 --> 02:53:03,540
sell I'm not talking about Goldman Sachs

4485
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:05,520
okay Goldman Sachs doesn't know this

4486
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:08,580
 okay they don't they don't know it

4487
02:53:08,580 --> 02:53:10,800
the things that you're learning

4488
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:14,160
every high frequency trading algorithm

4489
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:17,399
they Implement these ideas

4490
02:53:17,399 --> 02:53:19,260
what constitutes a high frequency

4491
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:21,720
trading algorithm buy or sell

4492
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:24,600
isn't on the basis of a pattern

4493
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:26,520
it's not on harmonics

4494
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:28,020
has nothing to do with anything

4495
02:53:28,020 --> 02:53:30,120
supplying a man has nothing to do with

4496
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:30,960
that

4497
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:33,899
there is a draw that price will stay

4498
02:53:33,899 --> 02:53:37,439
within a buy program it'll Buy

4499
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:40,140
as long as this criteria is in in play

4500
02:53:40,140 --> 02:53:41,700
or in existence

4501
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:44,040
and there will be a sell model

4502
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:46,080
that they'll only shorten when these

4503
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,540
specific things are met and there are a

4504
02:53:48,540 --> 02:53:51,660
there are many chaos high frequency

4505
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:53,520
trading algorithms where they trade both

4506
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:54,779
directions

4507
02:53:54,779 --> 02:53:57,779
all day long all day long up and down up

4508
02:53:57,779 --> 02:53:58,620
and down

4509
02:53:58,620 --> 02:54:01,920
that's the part I can't teach you

4510
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:06,720
I can't I can't create a language

4511
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:09,300
where

4512
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,279
I just can't there you go I'm just going

4513
02:54:11,279 --> 02:54:13,260
to leave it that I can't so therefore

4514
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:16,500
what I can teach I have

4515
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:18,540
and any one of the things I've already

4516
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:20,100
taught and I have more things I want to

4517
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:22,140
teach between now November

4518
02:54:22,140 --> 02:54:24,359
but any one of these one

4519
02:54:24,359 --> 02:54:28,260
things these PD arrays okay if you apply

4520
02:54:28,260 --> 02:54:30,540
it with where the Market's going to go

4521
02:54:30,540 --> 02:54:32,460
where is it likely to go

4522
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,960
and you stay with that in that model and

4523
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:35,160
you trade around specific times of the

4524
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:36,600
day

4525
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,939
you can find profitability and it's not

4526
02:54:38,939 --> 02:54:40,319
hard

4527
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:42,479
just Silver Bullet there's another model

4528
02:54:42,479 --> 02:54:44,160
I just gave out and I told you you can

4529
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:45,180
use it in every one of the kill zones

4530
02:54:45,180 --> 02:54:46,800
London

4531
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:50,819
New York am New York P.M

4532
02:54:50,819 --> 02:54:52,920
every single day you have three solid

4533
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:54,300
opportunities

4534
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:56,279
really good opportunities I taught you

4535
02:54:56,279 --> 02:54:59,240
how to trade the lunch hour

4536
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:03,000
I mean think about it folks you have so

4537
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:04,979
many ways to choose from but which one

4538
02:55:04,979 --> 02:55:06,359
makes the most sense to you which one

4539
02:55:06,359 --> 02:55:08,399
can you use

4540
02:55:08,399 --> 02:55:10,500
here's an example right here of using

4541
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:15,120
the logic your baby brand new spanking

4542
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:17,460
new right off the showroom floor you got

4543
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:20,100
your 100 000 account you're funded now

4544
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:21,479
okay

4545
02:55:21,479 --> 02:55:24,000
using the logic there you go nineteen

4546
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,500
thousand dollars one day

4547
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:31,140
would that be enough

4548
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:34,380
would that be enough if half of that was

4549
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:36,359
done by you

4550
02:55:36,359 --> 02:55:38,340
would that be enough

4551
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:40,680
if one tenth

4552
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:43,260
of this was done

4553
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:45,779
would that be enough for you I don't

4554
02:55:45,779 --> 02:55:47,760
know what's going to be enough for you

4555
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:49,560
but many of you look at this is this

4556
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:51,359
isn't good enough

4557
02:55:51,359 --> 02:55:52,979
because you watch somebody else do

4558
02:55:52,979 --> 02:55:54,600
something folks literally I could sit

4559
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:57,180
down here every single day enroll these

4560
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:58,560
accounts up hundreds of thousands of

4561
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:00,600
dollars in days

4562
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:03,359
it's no effort for me to do it okay but

4563
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:05,640
that doesn't communicate a realistic

4564
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:08,220
objective for students

4565
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,380
because if I show you these things all

4566
02:56:10,380 --> 02:56:11,760
the time

4567
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:13,200
you're going to think when you make five

4568
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:15,000
thousand dollars over a month that's not

4569
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,100
enough and you're gonna press harder and

4570
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:19,620
you're gonna wreck yourself

4571
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:26,399
hi reward trading or really big results

4572
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:29,160
that's for people that are trading with

4573
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:30,720
the expectation of trying to fleece you

4574
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:32,460
to sell you something I don't need to

4575
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:33,960
sell anything to you

4576
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:35,760
I don't want you to buy my books how's

4577
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:38,279
that how's that work for you I saw a guy

4578
02:56:38,279 --> 02:56:40,260
tweet to me ICT is thinking about all

4579
02:56:40,260 --> 02:56:41,279
the money you want to make from the book

4580
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:43,859
sales I'm trying to put so much into

4581
02:56:43,859 --> 02:56:45,720
this YouTube channel that you don't feel

4582
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:47,520
inspired about

4583
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:50,160
how's that work for you I don't care if

4584
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:52,380
it sells a lot I don't care I only want

4585
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:55,380
it in print because everybody out there

4586
02:56:55,380 --> 02:56:57,180
that has pretended they found this stuff

4587
02:56:57,180 --> 02:56:59,939
on their own there's no way none

4588
02:56:59,939 --> 02:57:01,439
of you Jokers would have ever learned

4589
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:02,819
this stuff by looking at charts or

4590
02:57:02,819 --> 02:57:04,260
studying it you never would have learned

4591
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:06,000
it because I'm telling you I was

4592
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:09,240
influenced by people you'll never meet

4593
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:11,840
sorry

4594
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:14,340
and you hear these guys out there yeah

4595
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:15,600
you know I figured this out you didn't

4596
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:17,460
figure out you figured out where my

4597
02:57:17,460 --> 02:57:18,660
YouTube channel was and you found out

4598
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:20,160
where the telegram channels had my

4599
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:21,840
leaked mentorship videos that's what you

4600
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:22,859
figured out

4601
02:57:22,859 --> 02:57:26,000
that's the only thing you did

4602
02:57:27,420 --> 02:57:29,279
the books will only be there for the

4603
02:57:29,279 --> 02:57:32,040
purposes of concreting it in history

4604
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:34,560
that it came from me and that's it

4605
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:36,600
that's all that's the only reason why

4606
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:37,920
I'm doing it

4607
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,779
but I'm putting so much into these

4608
02:57:39,779 --> 02:57:42,420
YouTube videos in the content that you

4609
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:44,520
really won't need to buy it

4610
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:47,279
you won't need to so stop listening to

4611
02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:48,660
the from other people out there

4612
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,040
saying oh he's trying to get your money

4613
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:52,140
I don't want you to buy the books period

4614
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:55,200
don't buy them let them be

4615
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:57,720
barely profitable for Amazon if you do

4616
02:57:57,720 --> 02:58:00,479
this I don't care

4617
02:58:00,479 --> 02:58:03,300
it's just the record of this is what

4618
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:05,399
this is what it is this is what it came

4619
02:58:05,399 --> 02:58:08,340
from and this is how you use it and then

4620
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:09,600
when people want to take that book and

4621
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,160
rewrite it in their own language and

4622
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:13,920
create courses I don't give a

4623
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:15,840
I don't care because it's going to go on

4624
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:17,520
forever it's always going to go on like

4625
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,620
that okay I don't care I'm not losing

4626
02:58:19,620 --> 02:58:21,420
any sleep I'm not getting poor because

4627
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:23,580
of it okay I'm not gonna diminish

4628
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:24,960
because other people have taken my

4629
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:27,120
and rebranded I don't care I'm confident

4630
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,920
that they will now start putting things

4631
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:30,899
in people's hands even if they do that

4632
02:58:30,899 --> 02:58:32,700
it's not classy

4633
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:36,060
it doesn't have any any uh ethics behind

4634
02:58:36,060 --> 02:58:37,979
it

4635
02:58:37,979 --> 02:58:39,779
but people are still going to do it but

4636
02:58:39,779 --> 02:58:41,399
I know the end result will be the people

4637
02:58:41,399 --> 02:58:43,800
that buy it from them won't get hurt

4638
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:45,660
because they'll know the real even

4639
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:47,279
they call it something different I don't

4640
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:48,960
care but none of this stuff I'm teaching

4641
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:50,760
you existed in anything else and it's a

4642
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:53,160
million dollar Bounty folks one million

4643
02:58:53,160 --> 02:58:56,160
dollars of my my cash in your

4644
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,380
hands I'll drive it to your house give

4645
02:58:58,380 --> 02:59:00,479
you a cashier's check if you can prove

4646
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,700
that all the stuff I'm teaching existed

4647
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:05,520
anywhere in print prior to 1996. folks

4648
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,500
it just doesn't exist

4649
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,420
and this is the bottom line because

4650
02:59:09,420 --> 02:59:11,880
believe me a million dollars is a lot of

4651
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:12,899
people out there could use a million

4652
02:59:12,899 --> 02:59:15,060
dollars and I'm telling you they all say

4653
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:16,800
it oh it's replanted where the it

4654
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:17,880
come from

4655
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:19,979
where did it come from where did I

4656
02:59:19,979 --> 02:59:22,380
Rebrand nothing

4657
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,700
you guys talked and talked to talk

4658
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:25,260
instead of rebranded Chris Laurie I had

4659
02:59:25,260 --> 02:59:27,359
Chris Laurie come out there on Twitter

4660
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:30,740
and say nope that's not my

4661
02:59:31,380 --> 02:59:33,359
now you're saying Al Brooks I'm waiting

4662
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:35,040
for Al Brooks because he didn't talk

4663
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:37,620
about her fair value guy

4664
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:39,359
he didn't teach no invarian inversion

4665
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:40,979
fair that he got he didn't teach as an

4666
02:59:40,979 --> 02:59:42,600
entry none of that none of that

4667
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:45,000
 even holds water I blow holes

4668
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,560
through all that there's nothing

4669
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:48,300
out there like this and when you

4670
02:59:48,300 --> 02:59:49,800
understand it you're gonna appreciate

4671
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:51,720
that because you're holding something

4672
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:53,180
that

4673
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:56,399
99.9 of the people out there have no

4674
02:59:56,399 --> 02:59:59,640
idea even exists

4675
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:02,939
and I've been hiding in plain sight

4676
03:00:02,939 --> 03:00:05,580
behind a demo account the whole time out

4677
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:08,760
there hiding in plain sight

4678
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:10,859
because it's a demo oh don't listen to

4679
03:00:10,859 --> 03:00:12,359
that guy

4680
03:00:12,359 --> 03:00:14,220
my kid my students are killing it

4681
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:16,200
they're beating the out of

4682
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:19,140
everybody else's students

4683
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:21,660
they're murdering it I got people that

4684
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:23,640
are doing so well they don't give a

4685
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:26,840
about being on social media

4686
03:00:27,960 --> 03:00:29,460
what are you gonna do when you get the

4687
03:00:29,460 --> 03:00:30,660
skill set are you gonna go out there and

4688
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:32,760
flex on social media I'm gonna go out

4689
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:34,680
there and show the trolls are you gonna

4690
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:36,420
live your life

4691
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:38,640
and do what you want to do live how you

4692
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:40,439
want to live

4693
03:00:40,439 --> 03:00:41,880
there's going to be people doubting you

4694
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:43,680
all the time

4695
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:45,359
who gives a

4696
03:00:45,359 --> 03:00:48,420
who cares none of that stuff means

4697
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:49,560
anything

4698
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:51,660
if they got the time and interest to do

4699
03:00:51,660 --> 03:00:53,220
that kind of stuff that means they're

4700
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:55,500
miserable leave them there

4701
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:58,260
leave them in that you can't fix them I

4702
03:00:58,260 --> 03:00:59,880
tried many years I tried to do that kind

4703
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:01,319
of stuff for people

4704
03:01:01,319 --> 03:01:03,120
and I'm at that point man this is the 50

4705
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:04,920
year old kicking in I just don't get it

4706
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:06,660
either you subscribe to the ideas

4707
03:01:06,660 --> 03:01:08,760
because you've seen the effort the

4708
03:01:08,760 --> 03:01:10,500
efficacies of it and you've seen the

4709
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:12,600
background of the logic I'm sharing and

4710
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:14,399
how it's in the charts every day it

4711
03:01:14,399 --> 03:01:16,979
repeats over and over and over again

4712
03:01:16,979 --> 03:01:18,960
but is it for you

4713
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:20,460
because I'm gonna be honest it's not for

4714
03:01:20,460 --> 03:01:21,720
everybody

4715
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:23,040
it's not

4716
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,540
for some of you you need a moving

4717
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:26,220
average crossover you need to break out

4718
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:27,660
strategy and as long as you have good

4719
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:29,399
sound money management folks that can

4720
03:01:29,399 --> 03:01:31,260
make you money I'm not saying you can't

4721
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:33,180
do that I'm not saying people that trade

4722
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:35,279
with v-wop can't be profitable I watch

4723
03:01:35,279 --> 03:01:37,319
people on YouTube do it

4724
03:01:37,319 --> 03:01:39,000
they do it live

4725
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,580
that's no problem I don't care

4726
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:42,779
but that's

4727
03:01:42,779 --> 03:01:46,080
that's grade school level

4728
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:49,880
to what's really going on in price

4729
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,260
you're not going to get any closer than

4730
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:53,760
perfect

4731
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:55,380
I'm sorry

4732
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:57,720
but that's just the way it is

4733
03:01:57,720 --> 03:01:59,700
and when I talk like this it sounds

4734
03:01:59,700 --> 03:02:02,700
arrogant it sounds like I'm I'm a

4735
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:05,640
conceited prick I promise you I know I

4736
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:08,220
was one in my 20s

4737
03:02:08,220 --> 03:02:09,600
but I'm just talking to you like a

4738
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:10,439
friend

4739
03:02:10,439 --> 03:02:13,859
I'm trying to intervene because you're

4740
03:02:13,859 --> 03:02:17,060
holding yourself back

4741
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:19,319
you're holding yourself back you are the

4742
03:02:19,319 --> 03:02:21,180
one holding yourself back it's not me

4743
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,680
I've already taught you how to trade

4744
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:23,819
I've already taught you how to read

4745
03:02:23,819 --> 03:02:25,500
price I taught you models I told you

4746
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:27,479
entry strategies and and how to take

4747
03:02:27,479 --> 03:02:28,979
partials and where to move a stock I've

4748
03:02:28,979 --> 03:02:30,660
taught you now again why certain

4749
03:02:30,660 --> 03:02:32,399
imbalances will stay open

4750
03:02:32,399 --> 03:02:34,560
how do I know that go back and look at

4751
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:36,180
the examples when I'm doing it it's

4752
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:37,620
there

4753
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:39,600
but I'm not obligated now and I wasn't

4754
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:41,520
obligated in the past to prove anything

4755
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:44,120
to you

4756
03:02:44,340 --> 03:02:46,859
I started out this whole thing on baby

4757
03:02:46,859 --> 03:02:50,460
Pips as a social experiment to see if I

4758
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:52,920
created the same laboratory conditions

4759
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:57,000
that I went through would I get an ICT

4760
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,279
it never happened

4761
03:02:59,279 --> 03:03:01,560
I put all the things I taught in the

4762
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:03,420
order to put I put them in all the

4763
03:03:03,420 --> 03:03:05,520
lectures all the video series all them

4764
03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:08,520
before I even did paid memberships

4765
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:11,100
all those things that was the way I came

4766
03:03:11,100 --> 03:03:14,100
up in that order from my journals these

4767
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:15,779
are the things that I did where I was

4768
03:03:15,779 --> 03:03:17,760
spending my attention and not one person

4769
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,800
out of this entire community

4770
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:22,859
came out looking like me

4771
03:03:22,859 --> 03:03:25,260
and that was the reason why I did it it

4772
03:03:25,260 --> 03:03:27,479
was a selfish reason I wanted to see

4773
03:03:27,479 --> 03:03:30,660
could I as a laboratory scientist mad

4774
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:32,939
scientist try to create the same

4775
03:03:32,939 --> 03:03:35,880
scenario and with another ICT pop out

4776
03:03:35,880 --> 03:03:38,040
and they didn't

4777
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:40,680
and because I got the feedback from

4778
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:42,420
people that they were enjoying the

4779
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:44,779
things I was putting out

4780
03:03:44,779 --> 03:03:47,819
the understanding they were gaining the

4781
03:03:47,819 --> 03:03:49,920
confidence they were getting

4782
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:52,140
I fell in love with the idea of helping

4783
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:53,520
more people

4784
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:54,960
because originally

4785
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:56,819
it was just a self-centered just

4786
03:03:56,819 --> 03:04:00,380
experiment to see if I could create it

4787
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:02,939
and because I wasn't able to do it

4788
03:04:02,939 --> 03:04:04,500
I was pissed off

4789
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:06,300
in my obsessive compulsive kicked in as

4790
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:08,040
I get well then I'm going to put the

4791
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:11,160
work in to try to create one

4792
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:13,319
and then when more people started giving

4793
03:04:13,319 --> 03:04:14,760
me feedback

4794
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:17,520
it became like a like a rocket fuel and

4795
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:19,979
I was like wow this I really like this I

4796
03:04:19,979 --> 03:04:22,859
I love it I only would sell my

4797
03:04:22,859 --> 03:04:24,660
one-on-one mentorship

4798
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:27,479
in the 90s you wouldn't even like you

4799
03:04:27,479 --> 03:04:28,859
would never I would have never gone on

4800
03:04:28,859 --> 03:04:30,660
the internet and shared this stuff then

4801
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:33,240
never I would have never done it

4802
03:04:33,240 --> 03:04:35,220
I was selfish

4803
03:04:35,220 --> 03:04:37,920
and at the time I then believed if I

4804
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:39,120
talked to everybody it would fail

4805
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:40,979
everybody would do it and as I learned

4806
03:04:40,979 --> 03:04:42,300
more and more and more and learned how

4807
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:43,680
the markets really book

4808
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:45,420
yeah I don't give a I could

4809
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,680
literally put commercials on the

4810
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:49,380
internet and on the TV that had no sales

4811
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:51,000
pitch and say come to this YouTube

4812
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:52,859
channel and learn how to do this I

4813
03:04:52,859 --> 03:04:54,000
promise you you want to spend any money

4814
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:55,200
but you'll be better than you ever

4815
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:56,819
thought you could as a Trader stop

4816
03:04:56,819 --> 03:04:58,620
buying people's courses

4817
03:04:58,620 --> 03:05:00,779

I make all kinds of AD Revenue

4820
03:05:06,779 --> 03:05:08,520
I don't need it

4821
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:11,220

to do

4831
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:30,600
everyone wants to know what I'm going to

4832
03:05:30,600 --> 03:05:31,439
do next

4833
03:05:31,439 --> 03:05:33,620

humdrum but me again

and that's all I want

4836
03:05:38,279 --> 03:05:40,620
but in my absence I want to be able to

4837
03:05:40,620 --> 03:05:42,240
look in on all of you

4838
03:05:42,240 --> 03:05:44,760

4839
03:05:44,760 --> 03:05:45,479

03:05:56,340 --> 03:05:59,340
I'm always interested in that I have a

4847
03:05:59,340 --> 03:06:01,200
lot of emails I'll always get to you you

4848
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:04,500
know in a real timely manner

4849
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:06,000
that's not the uh

4850
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,779
mode of contact it is optimal but um

4851
03:06:09,779 --> 03:06:12,300
Twitter is while I'm on it but in

4852
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:15,779
November I will no longer tweet but my

4853
03:06:15,779 --> 03:06:16,859
Twitter's

4854
03:06:16,859 --> 03:06:19,439
space in my Twitter account will be

4855
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:20,640
active

4856
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:23,340
and my YouTube videos will stay up

4857
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:25,200
I just won't be doing any more of them

4858
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:28,319
okay I'm confident when I'm done with

4859
03:06:28,319 --> 03:06:29,460
you all

4860
03:06:29,460 --> 03:06:32,760
come November you will have had the best

4861
03:06:32,760 --> 03:06:35,160
learning experience from me as a mentor

4862
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:36,779
the best I can do

4863
03:06:36,779 --> 03:06:38,340
and I don't claim to be the best Mentor

4864
03:06:38,340 --> 03:06:39,660
I'm not

4865
03:06:39,660 --> 03:06:40,560
um

4866
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:42,180
I know invariably

4867
03:06:42,180 --> 03:06:44,580
some of you will do very very well with

4868
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:45,720
this information

4869
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:47,399
and you'll probably write books and

4870
03:06:47,399 --> 03:06:48,660
you'll probably make courses and you'll

4871
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:51,000
probably do whatever and actually teach

4872
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,640
it better once I'm done divulging what

4873
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:56,100
it is of not you know made available to

4874
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:57,120
people

4875
03:06:57,120 --> 03:07:01,020
my only request is is you credit me

4876
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:02,880
I don't I don't give a what you do

4877
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:04,380
with it after that because if I cared I

4878
03:07:04,380 --> 03:07:06,660
wouldn't put it out here

4879
03:07:06,660 --> 03:07:08,880
but I want you to give me the

4880
03:07:08,880 --> 03:07:11,640
opportunity to give God the glory for it

4881
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:13,439
that's what I don't want you to rob me

4882
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:15,300
from I don't care if you make because

4883
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:16,740
I've made millions of dollars for people

4884
03:07:16,740 --> 03:07:19,020
in the Middle East I've made millions of

4885
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:21,420
dollars for people in Africa that

4886
03:07:21,420 --> 03:07:23,220
they've sold my okay these people

4887
03:07:23,220 --> 03:07:25,620
have made lots of money selling my

4888
03:07:25,620 --> 03:07:27,899
videos okay one of my biggest trolls

4889
03:07:27,899 --> 03:07:29,460
have been selling my videos but pretends

4890
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:31,200
he hates me his whole channel is about

4891
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:34,020
me okay but he sold my and I know

4892
03:07:34,020 --> 03:07:35,520
and I don't give a I don't care

4893
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:37,380
he's got kids let him feed him the point

4894
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:41,160
is this I don't care

4895
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:42,600
I don't care

4896
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:45,479
eat from my table for free I have plenty

4897
03:07:45,479 --> 03:07:48,180
you're not going to starve me I can do

4898
03:07:48,180 --> 03:07:49,920
this stuff on my own

4899
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:52,140
and I want to see what you all do with

4900
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:53,580
it

4901
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:55,979
and I don't mean I bought a Lamborghini

4902
03:07:55,979 --> 03:07:58,080
that's not what I'm looking for I want

4903
03:07:58,080 --> 03:08:00,000
to see what you do with this in terms of

4904
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:01,260
helping other people how are you

4905
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:02,939
impacting other people

4906
03:08:02,939 --> 03:08:05,460
and I don't mean by teaching people

4907
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:08,279
I'm talking about how you impacted their

4908
03:08:08,279 --> 03:08:09,180
lives

4909
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:11,100
what did you do for them did you buy him

4910
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:13,680
a house did you pay off their student

4911
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:15,840
debt for them did you help them out when

4912
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:17,819
they needed a car and they just can't

4913
03:08:17,819 --> 03:08:19,920
afford to get one

4914
03:08:19,920 --> 03:08:22,859
do you support families financially that

4915
03:08:22,859 --> 03:08:24,600
are destitute

4916
03:08:24,600 --> 03:08:25,920
and you're not trying to get a reward

4917
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:27,660
for it I promise I will never ever ever

4918
03:08:27,660 --> 03:08:29,880
share that publicly I will never say

4919
03:08:29,880 --> 03:08:31,439
this person told me this this because

4920
03:08:31,439 --> 03:08:34,080
that's your reward then

4921
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:37,380
but I'm asking you I I know I've put

4922
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:40,200
people on the rich end with my content

4923
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,819
and they rebranded and made mentorships

4924
03:08:41,819 --> 03:08:43,680
and that's how they made their money

4925
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:46,020
that's not what I wanted to do that's

4926
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:49,380
not my target my target is to transform

4927
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:51,060
the lives and the minds and the thought

4928
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,979
processes of all of you as students to

4929
03:08:52,979 --> 03:08:54,779
not just simply listen to me as a mentor

4930
03:08:54,779 --> 03:08:56,939
about markets but how to live your life

4931
03:08:56,939 --> 03:08:58,979
better because I did not do the right

4932
03:08:58,979 --> 03:09:00,120
things

4933
03:09:00,120 --> 03:09:02,819
and I want you to know that I did not do

4934
03:09:02,819 --> 03:09:04,800
the right things I was not there for my

4935
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:06,240
wife as much as I should have been I've

4936
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:08,760
failed as a dad I should have been at

4937
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:09,960
their games I should have done all these

4938
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:11,040
things that's why I give you those

4939
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:13,700
lectures

4940
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,140
so that way you don't make those same

4941
03:09:16,140 --> 03:09:18,779
mistakes in the process of finding your

4942
03:09:18,779 --> 03:09:20,640
success and living in your success

4943
03:09:20,640 --> 03:09:25,399
because you you can succeed into failure

4944
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:27,840
I did

4945
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:29,760
lots of money

4946
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:31,439
the ability to live however you want to

4947
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:34,220
live and buy stuff

4948
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:36,779
and you have a deficit in the emotional

4949
03:09:36,779 --> 03:09:42,080
category for fatherhood and husbandry

4950
03:09:42,840 --> 03:09:45,180
it's not all about the money folks right

4951
03:09:45,180 --> 03:09:47,460
now it does feel like that

4952
03:09:47,460 --> 03:09:49,620
but there has to be a purpose for all of

4953
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:51,779
it and how you live your life and what

4954
03:09:51,779 --> 03:09:53,100
you do with it

4955
03:09:53,100 --> 03:09:55,319
that's impactful not only to yourself

4956
03:09:55,319 --> 03:09:59,220
but the people that you're helping

4957
03:09:59,220 --> 03:10:02,100
and as a 20 year old when I had this

4958
03:10:02,100 --> 03:10:04,620
information it was all about me

4959
03:10:04,620 --> 03:10:06,840
and I've wanted it to be about me

4960
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:09,060
I don't want to be the center of

4961
03:10:09,060 --> 03:10:11,640
attention I don't want to be at it all

4962
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:14,100
and

4963
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:17,040
I hope that you understand that when I

4964
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:20,279
do depart in November

4965
03:10:20,279 --> 03:10:22,319
I have all of your best interests in

4966
03:10:22,319 --> 03:10:25,319
mind and I'm all rooting for you I I'm

4967
03:10:25,319 --> 03:10:27,140
always rooting for you I'm

4968
03:10:27,140 --> 03:10:29,640
constantly in prayer that you all

4969
03:10:29,640 --> 03:10:30,660
receive

4970
03:10:30,660 --> 03:10:32,220
what it is I'm trying to convey and

4971
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:33,960
sometimes when I've listened to

4972
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:36,899
recordings or whatnot

4973
03:10:36,899 --> 03:10:38,520
I wish I could go back in time and add

4974
03:10:38,520 --> 03:10:39,779
something else

4975
03:10:39,779 --> 03:10:41,220
okay

4976
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:41,819
um

4977
03:10:41,819 --> 03:10:44,819
it would have been much more

4978
03:10:44,819 --> 03:10:46,920
helpful if I would have said this or

4979
03:10:46,920 --> 03:10:49,439
that so like I said I'm not the best

4980
03:10:49,439 --> 03:10:52,859
mentor and

4981
03:10:54,060 --> 03:10:57,000
if I don't do it for you come November

4982
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,340
don't give up

4983
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:01,080
don't give up

4984
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,180
keep working towards it

4985
03:11:03,180 --> 03:11:04,979
because if you see just a little bit of

4986
03:11:04,979 --> 03:11:07,020
evidence that you can do it once in a

4987
03:11:07,020 --> 03:11:09,000
while that's okay

4988
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,279
because long term consistently

4989
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:14,760
profitable has a period of hit and miss

4990
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:16,740
Break Even if you can get to that point

4991
03:11:16,740 --> 03:11:18,420
where your break even where you make a

4992
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:19,620
little bit but then you lose it but you

4993
03:11:19,620 --> 03:11:22,380
don't blow out that's progress

4994
03:11:22,380 --> 03:11:24,300
that's progress and you'd be surprised

4995
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:26,460
how many people come to me in that stage

4996
03:11:26,460 --> 03:11:28,319
they've done all this stuff they make a

4997
03:11:28,319 --> 03:11:29,399
little bit of money then they lose it

4998
03:11:29,399 --> 03:11:30,960
and they can't they don't blow their

4999
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:32,279
account but they just can't find

5000
03:11:32,279 --> 03:11:34,680
profitability you are the best student

5001
03:11:34,680 --> 03:11:36,300
in my hands

5002
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:39,620
you are the best one

5003
03:11:39,960 --> 03:11:42,420
so don't think that that's a reason for

5004
03:11:42,420 --> 03:11:44,460
you to feel like you know I'm feeling as

5005
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:45,779
I'm doing this because I can't be

5006
03:11:45,779 --> 03:11:47,160
profitable I'm not going to waste any

5007
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:48,720
more time with this stuff

5008
03:11:48,720 --> 03:11:50,939
come into these lectures

5009
03:11:50,939 --> 03:11:52,500
and do the things I'm telling you to do

5010
03:11:52,500 --> 03:11:54,359
and just sit back and watch the

5011
03:11:54,359 --> 03:11:56,100
transformation

5012
03:11:56,100 --> 03:11:57,479
it'll happen

5013
03:11:57,479 --> 03:12:00,380
it will happen

5014
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:03,420
the ones that don't do well under me are

5015
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:05,939
the brand new never learned how to trade

5016
03:12:05,939 --> 03:12:08,340
don't know anything and they have no

5017
03:12:08,340 --> 03:12:09,600
reason

5018
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:11,880
to have that velcro effect

5019
03:12:11,880 --> 03:12:14,819
that I can I can't cling to them or they

5020
03:12:14,819 --> 03:12:16,380
can't cling to me long enough to let

5021
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:18,600
them have this logic seep into their

5022
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:20,160
understanding and then they see it for

5023
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:21,540
themselves it's too easy for them to

5024
03:12:21,540 --> 03:12:23,840
walk away

5025
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,620
it's too easy

5026
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:27,479
because they don't have anything to to

5027
03:12:27,479 --> 03:12:30,240
lean on as experience or Reason to see

5028
03:12:30,240 --> 03:12:33,479
well let me stick with this

5029
03:12:33,479 --> 03:12:36,720
if I did signals if I said you know I'm

5030
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:38,700
buying here I'm selling here the only

5031
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:41,160
thing that's going to do is grow a

5032
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:43,740
dependency in me

5033
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:45,420
and I don't want any of my students to

5034
03:12:45,420 --> 03:12:47,399
be dependent on me I want to be

5035
03:12:47,399 --> 03:12:49,380
independently minded so they go out and

5036
03:12:49,380 --> 03:12:50,700
they do their own thing and they're

5037
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:53,340
confident they they say ICT it's been

5038
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:56,040
great I learned from you but I don't

5039
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:57,960
need you anymore babe I'm gone

5040
03:12:57,960 --> 03:13:01,080
Watch Me Fly and I want to watch you fly

5041
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:03,899
I want to see that

5042
03:13:03,899 --> 03:13:06,120
but you have to put some work in and you

5043
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:08,340
got to let the information

5044
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:10,140
be presented in the manner that I'm

5045
03:13:10,140 --> 03:13:11,279
presenting because I don't know how to

5046
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:13,620
do it any better

5047
03:13:13,620 --> 03:13:15,060
I don't know how to do it better than

5048
03:13:15,060 --> 03:13:17,420
I'm doing

5049
03:13:18,899 --> 03:13:20,880
but I know it's working for a lot of

5050
03:13:20,880 --> 03:13:21,899
people

5051
03:13:21,899 --> 03:13:24,120
and all you have to do is keep showing

5052
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:27,960
up keep studying and fall in love with

5053
03:13:27,960 --> 03:13:29,880
this part of it because this is what

5054
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:30,899
you're going to do the rest of your life

5055
03:13:30,899 --> 03:13:33,120
so you might as well love it

5056
03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:34,979
you might as well fall in love with it

5057
03:13:34,979 --> 03:13:37,920
it's just like your second spouse

5058
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:40,560
okay I mean you're gonna have to love

5059
03:13:40,560 --> 03:13:42,000
doing this

5060
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,340
if you're miserable if you hate Trading

5061
03:13:44,340 --> 03:13:46,740
this ain't for you

5062
03:13:46,740 --> 03:13:49,080
it ain't for you but if you know that

5063
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:50,640
you're going to lose once in a while

5064
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:52,439
but it's okay nothing changes anything

5065
03:13:52,439 --> 03:13:54,960
this means that you gotta fix that to go

5066
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:57,300
to a new Equity high it's fine that's

5067
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:59,040
the right mindset and you're not in a

5068
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:00,359
hurry to get there

5069
03:14:00,359 --> 03:14:02,819
regardless of how old or young you are

5070
03:14:02,819 --> 03:14:06,840
just relax let it happen it took me six

5071
03:14:06,840 --> 03:14:09,120
years to find myself

5072
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:11,100
many of you probably already have what

5073
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:12,600
is you're going to be trading with but

5074
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:13,800
you're wrestling because every time I

5075
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:15,540
bring out something new you want that to

5076
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:17,460
be the thing oh wow that's new let me

5077
03:14:17,460 --> 03:14:18,300
try that

5078
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:19,560
if you already got something you're

5079
03:14:19,560 --> 03:14:22,020
seeing results with stay with that

5080
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:25,020
stay with that find some consistency

5081
03:14:25,020 --> 03:14:27,180
with that and then once you've done it

5082
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:28,680
for a few months if you want to

5083
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:30,600
supplement your understanding Del Ventus

5084
03:14:30,600 --> 03:14:32,040
you know supplementary studies with

5085
03:14:32,040 --> 03:14:33,600
other things that you are interested in

5086
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:36,060
but you only need one thing

5087
03:14:36,060 --> 03:14:38,580
one thing

5088
03:14:38,580 --> 03:14:39,899
and you can make all the money you'd

5089
03:14:39,899 --> 03:14:42,200
ever want

5090
03:14:42,240 --> 03:14:44,100
so

5091
03:14:44,100 --> 03:14:46,819
hopefully hopefully you guys have

5092
03:14:46,819 --> 03:14:49,020
learned something today I had a lot of

5093
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:51,660
fun spending some time with you

5094
03:14:51,660 --> 03:14:52,500
um if

5095
03:14:52,500 --> 03:14:54,420
you know like I said if you like this

5096
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:55,920
stuff and you want to see me do it again

5097
03:14:55,920 --> 03:14:58,859
on uh tomorrow

5098
03:14:58,859 --> 03:15:00,899
and a Thursday I guess it would be so

5099
03:15:00,899 --> 03:15:03,960
Wednesday and Thursday I'm heading out

5100
03:15:03,960 --> 03:15:06,420
with my wife on Friday for the weekend

5101
03:15:06,420 --> 03:15:09,840
and I'll be home on Tuesday so I won't

5102
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:13,160
be doing anything on Monday so

5103
03:15:13,979 --> 03:15:16,380
I think that'll be it for this one

5104
03:15:16,380 --> 03:15:18,600
until I'll talk to you next time

5105
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:21,200
be safe
