00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,800
welcome back

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,439
folks this is the last

3
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
teaching lecture on the inner circle

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
Trader YouTube

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
channel before get into this one just

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
let you know that uh this is one of the

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
closest viewpoints to how I actually

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,800
trade now when I say that don't gloss

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
over at thinking well you know that's

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,199
all well and good what what does that

11
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,399
mean it means that you have to

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,640
understand all the PD

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,600
arrays you have to be familiar with them

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,199
because what you may or may not realize

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,519
is a market maker model

16
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,480
is relying on your understanding of

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,438
every PD I've made

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,240
available so if you're looking at price

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
you're going to see things in price that

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,360
are going to be Salient to your

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,479
understanding if you don't know what a

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
breaker is if you don't know what a

23
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,400
mitigation block is if you don't know

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,320
what a inversion fair value Gap

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
is the

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
observation of seeing it real time as a

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,400
market maker buy or sell model May

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,079
Escape you at the time when you're

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,880
looking at Price action live so one of

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,520
the things I've seen throughout teaching

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,600
this is that some of my students can see

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
a market maker model really really quick

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,520
and it's because they have been familiar

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
with a multitude of PD arrays not just

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
simply an order block or a breaker so

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,320
they can see things and have a better

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
understanding about price action and

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,079
that's what I mean by graduating in your

39
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,880
understanding and not rushing this

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,240
so while this is the last Model I'm

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,200
teaching

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,160
publicly

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,758
the I guess the the disclaimer going in

44
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,640
should be that this is going to be very

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,440
difficult for a lot of you and I'm not

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,879
going to Sugar Cod that um when I taught

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,239
my private mentorship students I told

48
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,599
them that you these are things that are

49
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,480
going

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,840
to require you to know all the things

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,000
that I taught in mentorship there's

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,280
going to be multitudes

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
of Market maker sell and buy models that

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,239
are going to escape you you won't see

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,440
them until after the fact but don't

56
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,760
discount that as wasted opportunity log

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,000
them Journal them mark them up okay and

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
then annotate them in a way where it

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,360
looks like you seen it coming in journal

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,599
just like that so that way when you look

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,159
at your Journal it'll be in your own

62
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,000
words that you saw it coming it's all

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,840
pseudo experience it's it's conditioning

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
your brain to see it as a positive thing

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
so that way when you see it again it's a

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,680
rewarding experience and your

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,720
subconscious is not trying to distract

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,799
you from a painful experience whereas if

69
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,120
you don't journal and you only have bad

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,879
experiences by trying to trade with real

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,159
money or try to do something where

72
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,159
incurred risk is real versus trying to

73
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,480
read price action and there's no

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
monetary risk or gain there's no ego

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,959
there's no Pride there's no pain all

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,680
these things are going to

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,159
help getting you closer to understanding

78
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,439
a market

79
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,000
model

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
but for the sake of brevity everything I

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
disclose in this teaching just reverse

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
it for a market maker buy model Okay

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,159
because I'm going to focus primarily on

84
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,920
a market maker sell model everything

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
here is shown in Reverse if you were

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,159
applying it to a market maker Bond model

87
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,640
now I do have lectures and teachings on

88
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,360
this in the YouTube channel so this

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,840
isn't meant to be a be all end all I'm

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
leaning on

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
the assumptions that you have already

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,560
studied a lot of the things I'm going to

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,120
talk about so if this is one of the

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,760
First videos you've ever watched by me

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
or if you're a relatively new student

96
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,640
this is probably going to go over your

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,560
head and that's a normal thing okay it's

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,199
it would be considered a little

99
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,399
Advanced and and that's why I'm saying

100
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,880
it's it's the closest thing to how I

101
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,000
internalize price action when I'm

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,680
engaging it so 99% of the time when I'm

103
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
taking a

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,759
trade it's usually something like this

105
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,639
that's the framework behind it okay and

106
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,960
I may or may not have the time or

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,080
interest even to disclose the model that

108
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,639
I'm actually trading inside of that

109
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,840
would be the market maker buy or sell

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,400
model but when you look at it

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,680
conceptually you can

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
fragmentize these price swings and make

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680
one segment of the market maker model

114
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,520
whether it be a buy or sell model and

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,880
that in itself may be your unique model

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
that you trade not that you're trying to

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
trade the bottom of a market maker buy

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
model to the

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,880
top or vice versa for a sell you it's a

120
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
matter of preference what you want to do

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,560
because there's a buy and sell curve buy

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,600
side of the curve and the sell side of

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
the curve and we'll discuss that in here

124
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,280
now but uh this teaching is my market

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,560
maker models it's algorithmic price

126
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,960
delivery in institutional price

127
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,560
swings all right so I guess in a lot of

128
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,039
ways this is just basically my

129
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,280
interpretation and creating a language

130
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,680
around swing Trading

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,479
now when I say swing trading what I'm

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
referring to is if I'm bullish I'm

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,280
trading from discount to

134
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,080
premium riding the code tailes of buy

135
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,840
side

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,120
delivery if I'm bearish I'm trading from

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,759
premium to Discount writing the coat

138
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,360
Tales of sside

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,880
delivery now when I mentioned buy side

140
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,080
and sside you're thinking liquidity and

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm going to draw a distinction between

142
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,479
the liquidity and the

143
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
delivery

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
all right so imagine if you will that

145
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,400
you were looking at price and those

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,360
relative equal highs right here that

147
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,560
we're looking at

148
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
conceptually uh we would

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,240
anticipate a run above

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
that now if you can get that far in your

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
understanding from what I've taught you

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
have the beginning building blocks of

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,360
understanding how to look for a market

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
maker sell

155
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,080
model but I want to flesh this out a

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,759
little bit because it's not just simply

157
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,520
understanding where relative equal highs

158
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
and relative equal lows are you have to

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
understand what the Market's trying to

160
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,319
do and gravitate to and for the premise

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,319
of doing it to go higher longer term or

162
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,160
to go up just to trick people into being

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,639
long and then going lower longer term

164
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,560
that's narrative so that's going to be

165
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,800
outside the scope of this teaching so

166
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
again it's going to be very frustrating

167
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
for you if you think this is going to be

168
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
like a really Elementary model like the

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,720
Silver Bullet which is relatively simple

170
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,680
or model 2022 which is relatively simple

171
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,879
uh this one's going to have a whole lot

172
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,840
of talking in it because I'm reminding

173
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
you of the things that going to be

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,599
supportive for you to understand how to

175
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,000
trade these

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,520
things if you're trying to trade like me

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
you're going to have to learn to do what

178
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm talking about here if you're not

179
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,199
inspired to try to trade like me and you

180
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,720
just want to trade a silver bullet or a

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,479
model 2022 and that's all that you're

182
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,400
interested in and you're content with

183
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,080
being successful with that wonderful you

184
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,000
do not need to have this level of

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,199
understanding it is helpful to try to

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,639
look at Price action every day every

187
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,039
week every month and go through and see

188
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,840
if you can find these types of models in

189
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,080
price action and by collecting them

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,479
you'll have a better understanding of

191
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,520
what they look like in the future

192
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,440
because you've seen lots of examples of

193
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,800
it that you've fited out of price action

194
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,759
not me pointing to it or someone else

195
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,639
pointing to it after the fact you want

196
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,759
to be able to do this this on your own

197
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,080
but for the sake of this

198
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,520
discussion the understanding is we

199
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,199
should be able to see those relative

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,759
equal highs and that

201
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,879
being this here and this here now I'm

202
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:20,319
I'm using a a close line chart so it's

203
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,360
going to be a rather crude depiction of

204
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,960
a general idea okay we'll transition to

205
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,039
actual charts in a moment but for now I

206
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,360
want you to just think conceptu how if

207
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,959
the Market's going to run

208
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,440
eventually up above that and if we could

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,279
hold a bearish

210
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,760
stance meaning that we look at every

211
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,159
rally as a suspect rally if we're

212
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,560
bearish and then we're going to be

213
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,320
looking for some measure of reversal and

214
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,600
then once that reversal is qualified

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,399
that meets the criteria for a market

216
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,519
maker sell model then we can go in and

217
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,880
engage it now an advanced interpretation

218
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,279
of this would be

219
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,519
anticipating the Run above these

220
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,920
relative equal highs here and being long

221
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,560
prior to it and the most advanced form

222
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
of it would be to buy it during the buy

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
side of the curve and then short it

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
during the cells side of the curve that

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
is very Advanced and while I do have

226
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,640
students that can do that like me not

227
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,800
many of them can they can either trade

228
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,240
the long side of the side of the curve

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
or they can sell short on the cell side

230
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,000
of the curve so it's a matter of them

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,560
picking what they can see clearly based

232
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,440
on their present understanding and their

233
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
experience and don't try to rush it

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
don't try to keep up with me don't try

235
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,920
to keep up with my other students that

236
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,200
are doing well it's at your own pace

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,079
that you learn this that's the best Pace

238
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,040
to learn it at so don't try to feel like

239
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
you're you're behind or you're trying to

240
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
catch up with the class because I have

241
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,360
students that go back to 1996 so you're

242
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
never going to catch up to them

243
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
so I want you to take a look at that

244
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,680
price movement here if this is a market

245
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,279
that you'd be trading or interested in

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,120
learning uh these ideas are Universal so

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,880
it's not a matter of it only applies

248
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
to futures or it only applies to index

249
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
futures or Forex it's it's Universal

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,959
okay so as long as there's a price feed

251
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,920
attached to it and it can be traded

252
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
these conceptual ideas can be applied to

253
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,440
it okay

254
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,920
this whole idea from this run up to that

255
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
level there this is what I refer to as

256
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
buy side delivery okay so when price is

257
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,519
running higher it's offering buy

258
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,200
side it's giving the marketplace buy

259
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,079
side as it's running higher now for the

260
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,639
purposes of running Above This high and

261
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,680
this high it's running up to engage the

262
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
liquidity that would be resting above

263
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,600
these relative equal highs so the

264
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,320
distinction here is the directional

265
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,279
movement when it's going higher prices

266
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,920
in a buy side

267
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,519
delivery liquidity above a single or a

268
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,880
group of

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
highs that is buy side liquidity that's

270
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,800
orders that are pending whether they be

271
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,839
a buyer to break out and go long or to

272
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,240
protect a short position so liquidity is

273
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,959
a stagnant price level or

274
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,839
levels where stops would be reside buy

275
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,440
side delivery is the actual animated

276
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,880
movement of price moving higher and as

277
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,720
you probably would have guessed when

278
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,880
we're looking at Price going

279
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,079
lower this here is what I refer to as

280
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,120
sside delivery so the express purposes

281
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,200
of running above these relative equal

282
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,040
highs that function has been performed

283
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,200
so now price could if we're bearish move

284
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,519
lower and then trade back back below the

285
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,959
previous rally

286
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,320
low so it's buy side delivery to the

287
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,079
upside to engage

288
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,160
liquidity trap traders

289
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,320
[Music]

290
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,480
long and smart money would go short here

291
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
and write it back down to stop out any

292
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
individuals that were lucky enough to be

293
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,519
long in this but kept a stop loss here

294
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
or inside this run up during the buy

295
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,040
side delivery their stop loss will be

296
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,360
tagged

297
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,560
out and again with the premise of

298
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,079
reaching for the new

299
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,079
engineered cell side liquidity which

300
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
would be the cell stops on Longs that

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
anyone would have been going long here

302
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
their stop loss would be priced right

303
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,760
below

304
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,519
here so it's the rally up to take buy

305
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,959
side and then rip rate back down to take

306
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,760
the sell side on those individuals that

307
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,519
were trying to go long and weren't

308
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
astute enough to reverse or at the very

309
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,079
minimum close out in a profitable

310
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,839
position

311
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,079
now as I promised we're going to look at

312
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,800
it through the lens of open high low

313
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Clos

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
candlesticks

315
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,079
so take a couple minutes look at this

316
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,360
before I continue pause the video before

317
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,000
I start talking and make observations

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,519
about what you think you see here what's

319
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,240
Salient to you and when you're ready

320
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
unpause the

321
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,079
video all right so what we're looking at

322
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,360
here is basically the same idea of price

323
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,720
action instead of a line close chart

324
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,880
where every fluctuation is only noted by

325
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,720
where the interval will be utilizing

326
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,959
that closing price only not the highest

327
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,279
high and the lowest load but the closing

328
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,160
price here we're looking at the highest

329
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,360
high and lowest low and the open and

330
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,240
close of every individual Candlestick of

331
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,079
this respective time frame so we see the

332
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,759
relative equal highs here with this high

333
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,440
and this High here

334
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,839
and the M the market rallies up here so

335
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,320
all of this is the buy side delivery and

336
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
the subsequent sell-side delivery

337
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
attacking the cell side that was created

338
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,120
after the run higher and this run higher

339
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,399
attacks the relative equal highs here

340
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,079
where liquidity is so markets go up for

341
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,839
two primary reasons one it goes up to

342
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,959
engage buy stops which is buy side

343
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,120
liquidity or it goes up to an

344
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,920
inefficient

345
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,680
what is that well if you look right here

346
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,959
that's an

347
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,000
inefficiency we have this small little

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
segment of price action where the

349
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,040
previous candle's low stops here the

350
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,279
next candle opens trades up a little bit

351
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,440
goes

352
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,600
lower the next candle we open trade up

353
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,519
stop here and then we move

354
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,279
lower this separation between these

355
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,920
three candles here one candle in the

356
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,839
middle this is what I call a fair value

357
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,040
Gap it's a very specific price level

358
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
that we look for and it's one of the

359
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
most visual things you can see from my

360
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,920
repertoire and the things I teach your

361
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
eye should jump right to it when you see

362
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
it and in this case if you missed it you

363
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,759
can see clearly now it's highlighted so

364
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,600
because it's a down closed

365
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,320
candle what kind of inefficiency is it a

366
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,759
fair value Gap classified as a CBI sibi

367
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,560
sells side inbalance buy side

368
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,720
inefficiency meaning when these form the

369
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
Market's algorithm that produces the

370
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
fluctu in price not because it's buying

371
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,880
and selling pressure but the market

372
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,720
rallies to these predetermined levels

373
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,920
because it has to offer what here this

374
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,519
one single candle went lower so what

375
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
does it need to do if it's going to be

376
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
an efficient market it needs to trade up

377
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
back in between these two price points

378
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
this candle's low this candle's High we

379
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,519
see that here this candle trades up to

380
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,600
it where does the close stop right at

381
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,079
the high of it the next candle we open

382
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,120
and we trade back down yes yes there was

383
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,759
a small Wick here yes there was a small

384
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,839
little Wick here that is acceptable

385
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,000
that's permissible but the bodies tell

386
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,519
us the narrative so all of this rally up

387
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,120
here was under the pretense that we

388
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,959
would see it just simply trade back to

389
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,000
this little area

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,199
here above the buy side above this high

391
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,399
and this high so ICT how far can it go

392
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,000
above these relative equal highs you'd

393
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,519
have to look to see if there's any close

394
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,680
proximity in efficiencies in this case

395
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,839
we have one right here notice this

396
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,680
candle's tail goes way lower then we

397
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,399
open trade back up making the low of the

398
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,319
fair value Gap and then we trade here

399
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,000
lower then the next candle we open went

400
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,199
lower so all of these three candles here

401
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
we've had a lot of back and forth price

402
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,680
action there's no fair value Gap here we

403
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,000
can clearly see there's a gap because

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
there's only one candle making that

405
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,160
defined range of that low of that candle

406
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,440
and that candle's high so that small

407
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,880
little area here is a fair value Gap the

408
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,040
algorithm will go back to that and repic

409
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,560
to it how by going back up to it and

410
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,599
offering a patch filling in this Only

411
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,280
One Singular down closed candle now we

412
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,199
have an up Clos candle laying directly

413
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
right over top of it so it patches over

414
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
the inefficiency here in price

415
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,079
so right away you can see while this

416
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,280
discussion is primarily Market maker

417
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,400
models to understand what my market

418
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
maker model is you have to understand a

419
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,400
plethora of other supporting studies

420
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,480
so while it may be one of those things

421
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
that you're all going to try to

422
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,799
gravitate to over time just understand

423
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,160
it's going to take a lot of time to

424
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,039
understand the the

425
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,400
full magnitude of what's available in

426
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,679
terms of deciphering and reading price

427
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,200
it's not to Simply here is a time of day

428
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,919
here is a fair value Gap and where's the

429
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,240
draw on liquidity when you're using a

430
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,440
market maker sell and buy model you're

431
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
looking at multiple draws on liquidity

432
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,039
and you have to be more Nimble so I'm

433
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,440
saying this not to discourage you but to

434
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,159
remind you that it's going to take a

435
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,760
whole lot more effort than you probably

436
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,799
realize going into this I've made

437
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
available very very simple

438
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
straightforward Elementary models using

439
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
the concepts I've created so if you get

440
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
discouraged after this just know that

441
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,240
you can always revert back to the silver

442
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,360
bullet or the 2022 or optimal trade

443
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
entry models they're very

444
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
simple so let's go into greater detail

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
here how the market ran up into this

446
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,799
area here and focus on how it went down

447
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,240
not just simply below the cell side of

448
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,919
that original rally up but it went down

449
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,440
to this old low right here look real

450
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
close you'll see that it went just below

451
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
that that's not

452
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
random this right here is a bid balance

453
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
cellid efficiency it's the opposite of

454
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,520
this singular candle here it's an

455
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,280
upclose candle so it wouldn't be a Cy it

456
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,640
would be a bissy bidon balance cellid

457
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,159
efficiency so it digs into this just by

458
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:08,760
a little bit but specifically right

459
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,679
below that low again that's not random

460
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,799
these are things I like to look for you

461
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,400
can also see how we had that same thing

462
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,320
occurring here this is a b balance

463
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,440
efficiency again the opposite of

464
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,760
this up closed candles that create a

465
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,320
fair value gap or inefficiency is

466
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,240
referred to as a

467
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,520
bissy the classification by PD aray is

468
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,400
fair value Gap but it's an up close

469
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,440
candle so it's a buy side IM balance

470
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
sell side and efficiency meaning the

471
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,799
price will want to go back down to it

472
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,039
eventually and in here we have that

473
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,799
inbalance and then trades where down

474
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,360
once it gets into there reprices to the

475
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
order block then it rallies back up

476
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,080
creating the initial stage of what a

477
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,559
shift in Market structure Above This

478
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,159
High here so now we can look for a

479
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,000
retracement back down in so is as it's

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
retracing we're anticipating the price

481
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,559
doing what eventually reaching for the

482
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,360
high here and here so we can look for a

483
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
lower time frame to give us a scenario

484
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,280
where if we think it's going to go above

485
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,559
these relative equal highs and we can

486
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,120
see that this Fair B Gap wasn't hiding

487
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,919
it's in plain view it should stand out

488
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,679
on your chart that's why it you're

489
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,640
encouraged by me to annotate them when

490
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,720
you see them so if you see a draw on

491
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,240
liquidity that's setting up above or

492
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
below the marketplace don't just limit

493
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,760
your focus to that look in close

494
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,559
proximity just above these buy side

495
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,880
liquidity highs here that are relatively

496
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
equal how far can it go above it well

497
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
looking over here there's no

498
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,720
inefficiency here but there is one right

499
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,559
there so how far can it go above these

500
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,000
relative equal High there and look where

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,120
the body stop okay so that's not

502
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,919
random

503
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,000
all right so we're going to zoom in here

504
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
a little

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,600
bit drop down into a lower time frame

506
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,760
chart here and don't worry I'll let you

507
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,880
know what this is as we get to the close

508
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,600
of the lecture but just stick to what

509
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
I'm showing you

510
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
here we

511
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,880
have the

512
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,720
low buy side delivery trading up

513
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,679
into the fair value Gap that was on a

514
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,360
time frame that was 60 minutes but now

515
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,480
we're on a

516
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,440
15minute so this time frame here is a

517
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,840
15-minute time frame it's one quarter of

518
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,480
what was shown as the previous chart so

519
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,360
there's four times the number of

520
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,120
candles and I've given you a reference

521
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,799
point that it was based on a 60 Minute

522
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,799
or hourly fair value Gap in the form of

523
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,360
a Cy sell sign and balance byy sign

524
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,400
efficiency and still you can see the

525
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,320
body is respecting and only the

526
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,080
candlesticks Wicks are piercing it see

527
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,480
see that so that's very very indicative

528
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,880
of qualifying the fact that we've went

529
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
up to a specific level and therefore we

530
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,480
can trust that the algorithm is kind of

531
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,400
like broadcasting to those that know how

532
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,880
to look at it and see it that it's

533
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
likely to now reic lower repic to where

534
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,440
below this low and any accelerated run

535
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,640
below this low how far can it go is

536
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,120
there any efficiencies over here don't

537
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,679
look at this one because that's above

538
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,200
that low we would already be

539
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
anticipating retracement back below that

540
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
where will we look the rejection block

541
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
which is the lowest down close and then

542
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,640
we have these relative equal lows here

543
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
and you see it just goes a little bit

544
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,480
below that low rate there we're going to

545
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,799
get into this in a moment for now just

546
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,000
notice that we have ran above that buy

547
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,320
side that old high here that old high

548
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,720
here shift in Market structure on the

549
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,360
hourly chart Above This High here so

550
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,840
it's retracing what's it retracing back

551
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,840
down into the fair value got order block

552
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,960
right there so now does the market offer

553
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
a

554
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
consolidation that's what we would be

555
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
expecting here is it consolidating is it

556
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,919
offering a small little pause in price

557
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,320
where it goes sideways for a little

558
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,480
while which would be accumulating long

559
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
positions that's allowing smart money to

560
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
accumulate

561
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,919
longs

562
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm going to zoom in this is the same

563
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
time frame okay so it's 15

564
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,320
minute here's that low you can see how

565
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,919
we just went below it right here see

566
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
that here's that low inside the fair

567
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
value Gap with the order block which is

568
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,440
a down Clos candle again we would be

569
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,039
anticipating some measure of

570
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,840
consolidation not dropping

571
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
lower

572
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
consolidation because that means we

573
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,960
would be anticipating a run above the

574
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,480
buy side here and the previous height is

575
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,760
to the left outside the scope of what

576
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm zoomed in on now but you can see

577
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,760
it's still being highlighted and then

578
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,640
that 60 Minute fair value got in the

579
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,000
form of a cell sign and balance byid

580
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,919
efficiency that's here okay so what

581
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:13,919
we're going to do is we're going to drop

582
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,400
down to a even lower time frame and see

583
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,720
if there's any more detail in here with

584
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,480
a f minute

585
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,279
chart so now we're inside of a lower

586
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,919
time frame five minute chart and I've

587
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,000
highlighted

588
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,760
now this little area right down here I

589
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,520
told you we would talk about that in

590
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,440
here we're looking at a balanced price

591
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,360
range a balanced price range is where

592
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,120
the market has both a

593
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,919
downside and upside or sells side

594
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,440
delivery and buy side delivery that

595
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,840
overlap one another in the same relative

596
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,279
range in price so you can see how this

597
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,440
candle's

598
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,919
high that candles low that would

599
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,399
normally be what a sell sign balance byy

600
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,880
side and efficiency but look what's

601
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,720
happened over here we have a high a big

602
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,559
up closed candle and this candle's low

603
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,919
so what does that make

604
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,520
this a bid balance cell efficiency so

605
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,320
there's an overlapping between a CBI and

606
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
a bissy within the general area of the

607
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,320
same price range so I'm using the low

608
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,919
here and the high here so that way we

609
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,640
can see how this becomes a balanced

610
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,880
price range these are trapped Traders

611
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,960
okay this in here is a trap Trader or

612
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,799
trap traders that would have been caught

613
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,200
short in the classic days of commodity

614
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,720
trading if you were

615
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,679
to see old patterns like what would be

616
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,080
considered an island reversal okay uh

617
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,960
this is the closest thing that I can

618
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
kind of use to describe what's occurring

619
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,399
when there is a balanced price range

620
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,360
when it's extreme like this so when we

621
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,520
have a big decline large range candle

622
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,320
that's down and then eventually not like

623
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,200
months later not weeks later but when

624
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,679
it's a big drop and a handful of

625
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
candlesticks like this it's not a whole

626
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,360
lot of candles then eventually you know

627
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,520
rip back higher that means that this was

628
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,159
someone that's been caught their short

629
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,120
and they quickly repriced and leave them

630
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,039
down there so when I see that I look to

631
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,399
see where those two reference points are

632
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,960
where the market drops quickly for sells

633
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,720
side delivery and then when it rallies

634
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,279
back up

635
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,200
quickly those one big candles down one

636
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,960
big candle's up all the price ACS and

637
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
below it I would view that as trap

638
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,200
Trader so that means by itself that

639
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,799
gives me narrative that it's probably

640
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,200
going to go higher so now cue up the

641
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,240
idea of what would it be reaching for

642
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,960
well we see it was dropping back down

643
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,000
into an inefficiency here the buy side

644
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,440
here and old high back to the left and

645
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,440
that 60 Minute fair value Gap that's a

646
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,320
Cy up

647
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,360
here we're still in a 15-minute time

648
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
frame by the way I'm I miscued it

649
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
earlier calling a five

650
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,600
minute see the idea of the market

651
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,320
consolidating that's what we're showing

652
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,880
here now how am I referencing this

653
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,840
consolidation this is the part of it

654
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,039
that becomes like a knack okay um you

655
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,679
might not have the exact candles framed

656
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,120
like this

657
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,039
when you see an original consolidation

658
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,320
so when I call a original consolidation

659
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,640
that is where the market is accumulating

660
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,799
so what I did here I seen these two

661
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,559
candles here and then the body of this

662
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,559
one and the body of this one so right

663
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,080
away my eye jumps to that because it's

664
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,399
what it's a smooth

665
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,320
edge so I want to use that as the high

666
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,519
of the original consolidation what's the

667
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,000
low the lowest low see how easy that was

668
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,279
so when I'm looking at the original

669
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,519
consolidations I'm looking for a

670
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,279
repetitive overlapping or reoccurrence

671
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,960
of a level that's being constantly

672
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
referred back to inside of

673
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,519
consolidation now I'm anticipating the

674
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,200
market to go higher to go above the buy

675
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,559
side here and then reach up into this

676
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,679
inefficiency up

677
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,519
here but I'm anticipating also that it

678
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,840
should offer some measure of

679
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,279
consolidation because if it's going to

680
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,960
do that my premise behind swing trading

681
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
is it's all on the basis of a market

682
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,320
maker sell model or a market maker buy

683
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,000
model that's what swing trading is

684
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,320
whether you realize it or not whether

685
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,799
you want to subscribe to it or not

686
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,080
that's what the Market's doing it's not

687
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,200
doing harmonic stuff it's not doing L8

688
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,240
wave stuff it's moving on the principles

689
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
of running to liquidity or it's running

690
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,720
to inefficiencies and if it's not doing

691
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,640
that it's consolidating and if it's not

692
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,360
doing that it's highly manipulated and

693
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,240
then you're having some kind of manual

694
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
intervention some kind of shockin all

695
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
surprise rate announcement some kind of

696
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,360
wartime event something that would

697
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
destabilize the marketplace that you

698
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,519
can't and I can't predict before it

699
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,080
happens okay so that's always always the

700
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,440
underlying incurred risk that we have as

701
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,080
speculators so this area here is where

702
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
I'm framing that you can see still look

703
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
how many times it's referring to that

704
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,000
same level that's based over here so

705
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,519
when I'm looking at consolidations I'm

706
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,080
looking at levels that constantly repeat

707
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,519
I'm not just going to lay over top of

708
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,240
this high or this high or this High I'm

709
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,000
looking for something that frames it

710
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
very

711
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
clearly now when you go back and look at

712
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,240
my examples when I'm doing this in the

713
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
past and I've been doing for a long long

714
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,960
long time since the 90s but the examples

715
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I've made public look and see how I'm

716
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,279
drawing your attention to these specific

717
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,039
consolidations do you see it do you see

718
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,279
it as a consolidation go back and look

719
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,919
at your other annotations that maybe you

720
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,120
have journaled before start looking at

721
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
it like this so that way when you

722
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
understand it when the market does

723
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,080
eventually leave the original

724
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
consolidation because we're underlyingly

725
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,559
bullish we have traders that are trapped

726
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,320
down here they don't want to drop down

727
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,960
below to give them an opportunity to get

728
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,360
out even though the market does

729
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,799
eventually drop lower here they may not

730
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,600
come back down into this area until a

731
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,320
later time it could be weeks it could be

732
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,159
days it could be hours it could be you

733
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,399
know a time that's unknown to you that's

734
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,240
outside the scope of the the

735
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,880
presentation here what you're looking

736
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,519
for and what I'm looking for is trades

737
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,120
that make sense where the Market's

738
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
reaching for liquidity and efficiencies

739
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,840
and then reversing for the sake of going

740
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,080
back against the original consolidation

741
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,720
where people are going to see this as a

742
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,320
support level

743
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,760
and I don't trade support resistance I

744
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,440
attack support resistance I attack

745
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,159
liquidity above old highs I attack

746
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,960
liquidity below old lows and I use

747
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,480
inefficiencies as targets or means of

748
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,799
Entry to trade against those same ideas

749
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,519
which would be anti- retail Theory I'm

750
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,039
against it I'm opposed to retail Theory

751
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,720
anything retail if it's support

752
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,240
resistance harmonic patterns Elliot wave

753
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
G wi off all that stuff that's all

754
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,039
retail logic and my understanding is

755
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,240
that's the reason why that 90% people

756
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,200
that try to use all that stuff fail and

757
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,919
they and they fail rather

758
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,840
quickly

759
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,200
so when we can frame the original

760
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
consolidation properly then once we

761
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,799
leave it how do we how are we leaving it

762
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,440
here look at the body right

763
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,880
there yeah we had a wick here we had a

764
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,720
wick right there too but look at the

765
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
body St inside that original

766
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
consolidation see that that's

767
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,919
characteristic to algorithmic price

768
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,639
delivery it's indicating to individuals

769
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,840
that I'm trying to show you that this is

770
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,600
the language that traders that use this

771
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,639
information and the algorithms The High

772
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,360
Frequency trading algorithms they

773
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,600
highlight these things in price and so

774
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,720
it gets their highfrequency trading

775
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,480
algorithm in the hunt for long entries

776
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,120
when is it allowed to take the

777
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,159
long that candle right there tells you

778
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:59,120
so now we can then refer back to the

779
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,679
same level here if it trades back to

780
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,399
that

781
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:04,760
level what's it doing it's returning

782
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,240
back to the original

783
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,279
consolidation that's how I teach my

784
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,480
market maker in sell model and buy model

785
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,880
the original consolidation it can leave

786
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,000
it it doesn't have to touch it but if it

787
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,799
does that's usually a trade so this

788
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,000
would be your your original entry okay

789
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,919
so you could go long there but sometimes

790
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,279
it won't offer a return back to the

791
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,080
original consolidation so it might just

792
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,559
need a

793
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,440
higher order entry and not offer

794
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,720
something right at the high of the

795
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,440
original consolidation the market

796
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,960
rallies up trades right into that

797
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,919
60-minute fair Val got Cy bodies tell

798
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,559
the narrative it's not interest in going

799
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,200
any higher why because look at this big

800
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
candle drop down there

801
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,679
wonderful we have an inefficiency here

802
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:53,720
we have an inefficiency

803
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,039
here drops

804
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,559
aggressively below the original

805
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,279
consolidation right back to the high of

806
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,799
the Balan price range right there which

807
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,080
is also just below that old low right

808
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
there that make these relative equal

809
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,080
lows what suspect for cells side so

810
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,919
cells side liquidity resting below there

811
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,159
that's the draw if it's going to go well

812
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,799
beyond the low here where the original

813
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,840
consolidation cell side liquidity would

814
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,080
be resting so in in layman's terms what

815
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,960
saying is it's building up a lot of

816
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,320
interest to go higher then it rips

817
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,000
higher comes back down gives one more

818
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,159
chance okay one more

819
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,120
chance then takes off takes Above This

820
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,320
High here then reaches up into the INE

821
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,679
efficiency then at that

822
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,919
point does it indicate that it wants to

823
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,679
go lower because if you're bearish and

824
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,000
you're extremely bearish to the degree

825
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,279
where you think this is a good entry

826
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,639
point you could sell up here as it does

827
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,279
that and that's a little scary I

828
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,919
understand that

829
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,240
but eventually you get these multiple

830
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,840
entries in here where you can go short

831
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,159
we'll look at them in Greater detail in

832
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,200
a minute but eventually the idea was to

833
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,320
draw back down into this area here but

834
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,359
if it goes below this how far can it go

835
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,199
there's no inefficiency over here it's

836
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
these relative equal lows and that's

837
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,250
where the market drops

838
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,480
[Music]

839
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,480
to all right so now we have more

840
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,000
candlesticks and now this is the F

841
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
minute chart so here's the original

842
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,280
consolidation you see the market does in

843
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,320
fact drop back down in inversion fair

844
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,839
value Gap I don't have it highlighted

845
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:31,760
because it would be too many things on

846
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,399
the chart but for

847
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,639
you that's inversion fair value Gap

848
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,320
meaning that usually that would be sell

849
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,960
side and balance by side efficiency if

850
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,280
the market trades back up into it we

851
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,079
would see it what trade lower but if

852
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,760
it's an inversion fair value Gap it

853
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,159
means it's going to go above it come

854
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,560
back down and use it as a discount array

855
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,399
and it's inside of the original

856
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,280
consolidation and rallies takes the buy

857
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,440
side trades the 60-minute fair value Gap

858
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,800
cby even in the 5 minute look at the

859
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,200
candlesticks the bodies they're inside

860
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,040
that Cy it's indicating that yes there's

861
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,160
Wicks going on in here but that's just

862
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,119
the the the damage okay where it's

863
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,720
reaching for the best case for smart

864
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
money to get short

865
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,240
against and then we see it drop

866
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,400
lower zoomed in on that F minute chart

867
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,599
here we have the original consolidation

868
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,680
the rally up and I want you to pause the

869
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,520
video again and it if you're not doing

870
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,000
this I promise you you're really not

871
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,040
getting the same measure of

872
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,400
understanding and the opportunity to see

873
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,720
it in your own eyes and test your

874
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,760
observations you might not get it right

875
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,000
but that's okay trying and attempting to

876
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,560
do it and seeing things with

877
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,800
detail you might not have it exactly

878
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,359
right but what happens if you do have

879
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,960
the things I'm going to point out it's

880
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,000
encouraging so don't Rob yourself the

881
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
opportunity to have that so pause the

882
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,319
video take a look at all the price run

883
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,480
from here up to here and then down what

884
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,800
do you

885
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,160
see all right if you haven't paused the

886
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,079
video and want to you better have it

887
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,480
paused because I'm about to

888
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
continue when you're looking at

889
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,440
this my eye sees

890
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,359
this return to the original

891
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,359
consolidation the market rallies up we

892
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,359
have a down closed candle that's just

893
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,839
below this area right here what does

894
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:37,040
this up close candle

895
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,079
become bullish

896
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,640
breaker low high lower

897
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,800
low down closed candle inside of the

898
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,480
breaker candle over here that's a

899
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,400
bullish order block right there so when

900
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,720
it rallies Up And Trades back down in

901
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,000
our Target is what up here the initial

902
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,880
draw is the liquidity above that high in

903
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,680
the older High to the left it's not

904
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,880
inside this fractal price action anymore

905
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,359
but it's highlight with this line so

906
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,440
this drop down that could be if you're

907
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,800
not seeing the original consolidation

908
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,920
correctly and this would be your

909
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,560
original entry

910
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,119
or uh your first stage accumulation then

911
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
this would be second stage

912
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
reaccumulation here and it rallies up

913
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,240
but if you don't for the sake of those

914
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,200
individuals that wouldn't have it

915
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,560
identified correctly in terms of how big

916
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,440
the original consolidation is when it

917
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,880
leaves it and when it comes back down in

918
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,680
I'm making allowance for that for this

919
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,599
lecture here so you you might not have

920
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,960
that skill set in the beginning to see

921
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,160
exactly how to define the

922
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
consolidation then if that's the case

923
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,920
then the bullish order block here would

924
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
be your first stage accumulation for you

925
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
is it wrong to classify it this way no

926
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
it's based on your understanding they're

927
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,680
both correct based on the level of

928
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
experience and knowing what you're doing

929
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,040
the only distinction is is how you may

930
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
or may not have had the original

931
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,960
consolidation mapped out right so many

932
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,040
of you may not have seen this as a

933
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,319
return to the original consolidation you

934
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,079
may have seen this as relative equal

935
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,960
highs being taken and now it's going to

936
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,599
go lower not knowing all the other

937
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,680
narrative that I've outlined

938
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,839
here so down close candle here in the

939
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,040
scope of a bullish price run during

940
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,319
buyid delivery aiming for this area up

941
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:31,359
in here the down close candles traded to

942
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,200
here so there's your entry for a first

943
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
stage accumulation or it would be second

944
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,920
stage reaccumulation if you use this as

945
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,480
your first

946
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,520
entry so again just make sure you

947
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,800
understand that sometimes you will only

948
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,040
have one point of accumulation and not

949
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,720
have a return to original consolidation

950
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,880
it might just rip higher give you one to

951
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,240
go in and then run real quick to it then

952
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,680
and then after that bleed

953
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,000
lower so it has a lot of different

954
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,319
variances to it again which is why I

955
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:08,880
said that you have to understand

956
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
everything that I teach to be able to be

957
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,480
well versed with trading Market maker

958
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,119
models that doesn't mean that you can't

959
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,480
see a very generic plain as day obvious

960
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,000
Market maker sell or Market maker bu

961
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,880
model when it's in the price action it's

962
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,400
obvious it's real easy to see it but the

963
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,760
potential for more of them to be there

964
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,359
and in your fingertips to be able to

965
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,640
reach and see I can see more setups now

966
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,839
uh that's going to increase over time

967
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,960
okay so just understand that so what

968
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,440
have I said here so far well you have an

969
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,560
opportunity to be a long entry here or a

970
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,920
long entry there so there's two setups

971
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,760
which one of these without going any

972
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,560
further so far which one of these would

973
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,319
make sense for you as a Trader right now

974
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,079
with your present understanding

975
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,520
obviously it's a rhetorical question

976
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
because I I can't obviously get the

977
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,839
response from you here but I want you to

978
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:01,960
think about that because I have some

979
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,520
traders that would only be interested in

980
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,079
taking this as their entry and if they

981
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,200
never get a return to the original

982
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,440
consolidation they're not

983
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,520
long others want to see that then it

984
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
rallies and then the next buying

985
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,520
opportunity as long as we don't get to

986
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,160
the Target up here they're willing to

987
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,760
take this as the first stage

988
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,640
accumulation and that's their entry and

989
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,240
then they ride it up into that Target

990
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,480
they may or may not have the ability or

991
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,240
interest in trying to go short at that

992
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,839
time other Traders can identify this as

993
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,200
the first stage

994
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,480
accumulation maybe not see this one down

995
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,359
here and they see this and they want to

996
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,200
wait to see if price rallies up to that

997
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,880
point then they use this part as their

998
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
model where they go short and they

999
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,160
pyramid in here here and wait for the

1000
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,079
Run below here and don't even consider

1001
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,480
something like done here is that wrong

1002
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,839
no I have other students that want to

1003
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,640
see it do this then really prove it want

1004
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,200
to go lower and then they'll trade that

1005
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,400
one right there and then go into that

1006
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,640
that's a unicorn okay unicorn is second

1007
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,480
stage redistribution in a cell model

1008
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,599
Market maker cell

1009
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,720
model now when I say

1010
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,440
unicorn meaning everything's in your

1011
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
favor you got everything behind you it's

1012
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,400
just so it's so one-sided and you can

1013
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
see it It's usually the most energetic

1014
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,920
um swing high that it drops down from if

1015
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
you've classified everything correctly

1016
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,960
and everything to the left on the B side

1017
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
of the curve is identified correctly and

1018
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,640
you have everything labeled right and

1019
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
you have time and price in agreement

1020
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,520
with you chances are you're probably

1021
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,560
going to Ride the Lightning which is

1022
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,640
really quick sudden drops and it's real

1023
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,960
fun to be in those low resistance

1024
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,760
liquidity runs but that's one of the

1025
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,160
most qualifying factors in my trading

1026
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,520
and how I teach it to my students is to

1027
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,920
find the easist highe speed low

1028
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,839
resistance liquidity runs they're going

1029
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,920
to always be the second stage

1030
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,040
redistribution in a market maker sell

1031
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,680
model which is what this is right here

1032
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,400
okay

1033
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,880
so if you miss this one this is also

1034
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,760
what I teach which is

1035
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,400
a buy balance sell sign efficiency

1036
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,119
consequent encouragement which is the

1037
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,400
midpoint of this inefficiency did it get

1038
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,560
to this level up here yet nope so this

1039
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,119
here is a bullish fair value Gap

1040
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,960
consequent encroachment second stage

1041
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
reaccumulation right

1042
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,800
there now for some of you you might be

1043
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
going long in here and then adding and

1044
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,440
pyramiding to that to ride into this

1045
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,640
level here that might be your

1046
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,720
trade is there anything wrong with that

1047
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,640
nope absolutely

1048
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,160
not others that are high high-end

1049
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,920
students they have been doing for a long

1050
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,559
time they're going to sell these Mohawks

1051
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,559
because the bodies are already

1052
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,200
indicating that what it's not one to go

1053
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,960
outside of that 60-minute fair value Gap

1054
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
Cy so to every rally up here they're

1055
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,680
going to go short and anything outside

1056
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,800
of that PD arrays High which is the 60

1057
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,319
Minute fair value Gap that's an

1058
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,760
extreme extremely overbought without an

1059
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,599
indicator entry and you've seen me do

1060
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,680
that in my executions you've seen me do

1061
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
that with my pyramid entries you've

1062
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,359
watched me trade just outside of the

1063
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,640
fair V gaps when I'm bearish or bullish

1064
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,839
and it becomes the usually within a tick

1065
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,000
or two from the actual highest high or

1066
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,880
lowest low of the individual

1067
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,480
candlesticks and then it starts running

1068
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,000
the direction I need to

1069
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,599
go this is what I refer to as a smart

1070
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,720
money reversal you are years away from

1071
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,880
ever being able to do that consistently

1072
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,400
I promise you that's not me trying to

1073
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,760
talk down to you it takes a great deal

1074
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,359
of understanding of knowing what it is

1075
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,040
that we're trying to do here because

1076
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,280
essentially what you're doing is you're

1077
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,559
picking the tops in bearish

1078
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,520
markets now did you hear what it just

1079
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,800
said we're picking

1080
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,880
the tops in bearish markets I'm not

1081
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,680
afraid of that I don't try to discourage

1082
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,319
that of my students but I do absolutely

1083
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:07,720
discourage that in my own trading when

1084
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,359
it's a bull market I'm not trying to

1085
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,559
pick the top because they're always

1086
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:13,920
going to go well beyond what I think and

1087
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,839
what you think it's going to do but when

1088
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,359
we're bearish we can really get refined

1089
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,359
and trade the tops in bare markets

1090
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,880
because they're predictable they have a

1091
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,640
characteristic they have a a Rhyme or

1092
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,200
Reason as to why price should be behave

1093
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,040
a specific way versus when you're in an

1094
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
extremely bullish Market how do you

1095
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,720
know I don't know every single time that

1096
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,079
they won't go in there and intervene one

1097
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,760
more time and drive it one more time

1098
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,839
higher that's why it's dangerous to try

1099
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,800
to pick tops in Bull markets but when

1100
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,160
the market is predisposed to go lower

1101
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,280
and you have all these types of

1102
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,280
characteristics in Play It's rather

1103
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,880
simple to anticipate where the Market's

1104
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
going to run create an extreme and do a

1105
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,559
smart money reversal but that easy

1106
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,319
perspective I'm talking about that comes

1107
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,319
with 30 years experience you don't have

1108
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,680
30 years experience some of you don't

1109
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,720
even have 5 years experience so it's

1110
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,800
going to take a long time and I mean

1111
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,480
long time for you to be able to see

1112
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,040
smart money reversals as your entry

1113
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,920
points okay but you don't need that

1114
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,599
anticipate it being there and then once

1115
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,160
it does the market breaks lower and any

1116
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,520
rally back up look at the bodies here

1117
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,440
okay that is what that's consequent

1118
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,680
encroachment of the 60-minute fair value

1119
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,839
Gap CBI that's your lowrisk short

1120
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:27,960
we're trusting that we've already

1121
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,440
mohawked above here with these Wicks so

1122
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,280
now we're back down in here so any any

1123
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,839
attempt to trade in the middle point of

1124
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,480
this shaded area here that could be your

1125
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,160
lowrisk short stop loss right above

1126
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,240
here what happens if you get stopped out

1127
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,960
ICT same thing wait for it to go lower

1128
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,040
lead the fair value Gap low and if it

1129
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,440
can touch the bottom of it again I would

1130
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,559
use it as my entry stop would be break

1131
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,319
back above whatever the highest high was

1132
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,160
formed or the consequent coach of the

1133
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,200
wick if it formed a higher Wick here

1134
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,160
that's how i' would use it I would not

1135
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,599
be afraid to go back in but that low

1136
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,880
risk

1137
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,400
is scary for some of you probably most

1138
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,559
of you I'll be honest with you you would

1139
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:13,800
never look at to take the trade like

1140
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,520
that but how many examples have I done

1141
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,280
this I've done many examples of this in

1142
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,640
index Futures in Commodities I've done

1143
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,599
it

1144
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,119
in Forex pairs I I've shown a plethora

1145
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,440
of examples of this not just talking

1146
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,680
about like I'm doing here I'm actually

1147
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,720
executing I'm doing the entries I'm

1148
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,200
annotating the chart as I'm doing it too

1149
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,040
many times with a one minute chart time

1150
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,440
frame so I have to know what I'm doing

1151
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,040
to know not only what I intend to do

1152
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,720
trade-wise and managing it with a stop

1153
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,160
loss but also to outline it and type it

1154
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,680
out as the Market's gting with no Market

1155
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,559
replay all live so the market breaks

1156
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,960
lower and now what do we have

1157
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,440
we're on the right side of the curve

1158
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,440
that means this hypothetical invisible

1159
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,720
line where the market trades up during

1160
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,359
buy side delivery trades into our Target

1161
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,720
where we anticipate the likelihood of a

1162
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,480
reversal if the market starts to reverse

1163
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,559
then we use the highest high that it

1164
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:19,359
forms to the left of that is what the

1165
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,960
buy side of the curve that means

1166
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,800
everything leading to buy side delivery

1167
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,240
now on the left side is what the sell

1168
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,599
side of the curve that means we're in

1169
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,960
sells side delivery what is sells side

1170
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,119
delivery going to be aiming for the

1171
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,680
original consolidation low why because

1172
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,480
it wants to repic under the original

1173
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,319
accumulation for sell side liquidity the

1174
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,000
stops that are resting below here for

1175
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
Traders that rode this up they're

1176
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,960
married to the idea it's going to the

1177
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,440
Moon Bitcoin 100,000 that type of

1178
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,839
mentality eventually it drops and goes

1179
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:52,359
attacks them okay so we went above the

1180
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:55,359
buy side here to a specific price point

1181
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,440
we had have a

1182
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,680
breaker high low high or high body

1183
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,440
staying inside of the PD array on the 60

1184
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,200
Minute so it's indicating everything is

1185
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,040
there for this to start dropping

1186
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,880
basically that low is taken out right

1187
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,480
there what does it create Fair guy gap

1188
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,720
between this candle's low that candle's

1189
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,200
high that could be a trade in itself but

1190
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,960
this is a breaker so how far is it going

1191
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,359
to go back up into it right there so

1192
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,920
your bearish breaker that is your first

1193
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,280
stage

1194
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,160
distribution so you want to wait for the

1195
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,680
smart R reversal you want to see a

1196
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,760
lowrisk short does it show a willing to

1197
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,680
want to run away wonderful that's tape

1198
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,960
reading now you have a fair value Gap

1199
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,319
and you have a breaker trades up into it

1200
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:44,000
Go short that's your first stage

1201
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,559
distribution does it break lower yes it

1202
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,599
does then it does what it trades back to

1203
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,640
where we had buy side

1204
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,880
outlined support resistance folks are

1205
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,400
going to see that as well what remember

1206
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,520
that relative equal high that was a

1207
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,839
little bit higher than this one to the

1208
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,480
left they're going to see that as a

1209
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,640
break of resistance turn support that

1210
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,680
stuff does not work okay it does not

1211
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,480
work you have to understand what price

1212
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,960
is going to do why it's going to do it

1213
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,880
what's the present narrative and where's

1214
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,280
the liquidity or inefficiency is going

1215
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
to really draw to you can't just simply

1216
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,280
look at hypothetical imaginary lines

1217
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,839
that are horizontal or diagonal for

1218
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,160
goodness sake when you call it trend

1219
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,400
line me all that stuff is mythology it

1220
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,000
doesn't work it doesn't hold up so you

1221
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,640
have to know what price is trying to do

1222
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,640
how it gravitates and very specific

1223
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,440
precise elements to price

1224
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,839
action the market

1225
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:43,559
rallies up here into a bearish order

1226
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:45,799
block which is the up close candle here

1227
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:48,400
trades into it digs into half of the

1228
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,040
body right there that's mean threshold

1229
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,640
so that bearish order block is your

1230
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,839
second stage

1231
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,160
redistribution this is going to be the

1232
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,200
fastest elevator ride of the move going

1233
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,839
down now it doesn't mean it won't be a

1234
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:06,079
you know a sharp drop consolidate sharp

1235
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,079
drop consolidate sharp drop that it can

1236
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,720
do that but this is the one you want to

1237
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,280
be entered on because if usually if you

1238
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,839
miss this one you're probably going to

1239
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:19,200
be chasing price now what happens if you

1240
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,520
don't see this as your lowrisk short and

1241
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,200
you see this as your lowrisk short

1242
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,280
where I had the first a distribution is

1243
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,440
that wrong no based on your present

1244
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,079
understanding you're going to see it

1245
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,920
probably as this is the first stage of

1246
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,880
distribution to get short and the smart

1247
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,920
money reversal is up here wonderful you

1248
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,200
don't see a low risk short here in the

1249
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,960
middle of that PD array that's okay

1250
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
that's experience I understand that

1251
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,720
you're not going to see everything that

1252
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,880
I had seen and I'm make an allowances

1253
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,680
for that while I'm teaching it so you

1254
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,880
might see this as your your your lowrisk

1255
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,960
sell or short and then this is your

1256
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,440
first stage distribution so where would

1257
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,559
the second stage distribution be or

1258
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,680
redistribution be and it's in other

1259
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,920
words instead of saying this one is your

1260
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,079
second stage redistribution which means

1261
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,000
it's going to be the highest degree of

1262
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,319
speed magnitude and impulsiveness to go

1263
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:14,240
lower

1264
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,760
quicker if it's not this

1265
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,640
one and you've classified that

1266
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,000
as your first stage distribution and

1267
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,960
you're surprised with a sudden drop

1268
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,720
and you're going to be standing there

1269
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,960
like a deer in headlights thinking what

1270
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,359
am I supposed to do this thing going way

1271
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,240
faster than I thought it was you're

1272
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,440
going to be dazzled because you're on

1273
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,839
side and it's probably gonna scare you

1274
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,799
to get out of the trade and if you've

1275
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:38,880
never been trading with real money

1276
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,400
you're going to experience that okay

1277
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,720
it's a weird Paradigm but you have to

1278
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,000
press into

1279
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,599
that if you notice here I've said that

1280
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,680
the buy side of the curve used in

1281
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,520
Reverse in the cell side of the curve

1282
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,839
meaning what this down closed candle is

1283
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:58,119
a bullish order block so while we were

1284
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:00,480
going up when it drops back down into

1285
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,559
this it should be offering what

1286
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:05,880
support so when we get to the other side

1287
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,799
of the curve which is to the right of

1288
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:10,160
this imaginary line which is divided by

1289
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,760
the highest high where we anticipate

1290
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,920
anticipate seeing the market reverse on

1291
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,280
the right side of the curve that's the

1292
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
cell side so anything on the right side

1293
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,200
of the curve that was offered as support

1294
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,799
or as a discount array needs to start

1295
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:27,760
acting as what a premium array or

1296
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,440
resistance what's the low of that candle

1297
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,799
draw it through where's the body

1298
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:35,119
stopping it's respecting it isn't it

1299
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,200
it's not just simply that bearish order

1300
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,440
Block it's not as simple as you want to

1301
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,920
think it is folks everybody out there

1302
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,440
trying to teach order block Theory you

1303
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,319
have no idea what you're doing that's

1304
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:47,400
why I'm writing the books you have no

1305
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,680
idea you've only been introduced the

1306
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,920
idea you're trying to use things that

1307
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,240
you're making up as you go

1308
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,280
along

1309
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,000
we break lower same thing here buy side

1310
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,160
of the curve used in reverse on the sell

1311
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,000
side of the curve meaning what this down

1312
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,480
close candle what was it a bull shoulder

1313
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,839
block on the buy side of the curve but

1314
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,079
now we're on the left side of the curve

1315
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,799
everything should be going lower so what

1316
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:11,280
is going on here the Market's trading

1317
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,280
right back up to the butt end of that

1318
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,000
body boom that would be your second

1319
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,400
stage redistribution if you looked at

1320
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,160
that as first stage and this is the low

1321
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,000
risk short smart money reversal and you

1322
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,839
didn't classify anything low risk

1323
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,359
that would be your second stage

1324
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,480
redistribution for me that would be a

1325
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,160
pyramiding entry so I would have even

1326
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,359
more going short and then we drop down

1327
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,880
into original consolidation 80% of the

1328
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,400
trade would come off and I would see do

1329
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,680
we have the ability to get any deeper

1330
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,520
and we can see it goes lower deep

1331
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,120
retracement and finally lower in

1332
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,839
[Music]

1333
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,920
here so for the folks that want to know

1334
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,640
this entire presentation was under the

1335
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,240
discussion of the British pound versus

1336
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,280

1341
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,440
discussed so far but I mentioned

1342
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,400
briefing in the beginning of the

1343
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,680
discussion is when everything with price

1344
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,359
is in agreement with time because time

1345
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,760
sets the stage then price does the act

1346
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,440
of precision so it's time and

time that you're using for your trading

day I'm using times of the day that have

1384
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,680
high intakes of volume where order flow

1385
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,720
is increasing it's rapid there's a lot

1386
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,400
of interest getting in the

the

1398
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,720
range if the whole idea was to run up

1413
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,240
