[261] [00:10:52,639] it's running up to Engage-The-Liquidity that would be resting above these relative-equal-highs.

[272] [00:11:20] Liquidity is a stagnant price level or levels where stops would be reside

so when I'm looking at the Original-Consolidations:
        I'm looking for a repetitive-overlapping-of-a-level 
        I'm looking for a repetitive-overlapping or reoccurrence of a level 
        that's being constantly referred back to inside-of-consolidation.

    2. then price does the act of precision.
