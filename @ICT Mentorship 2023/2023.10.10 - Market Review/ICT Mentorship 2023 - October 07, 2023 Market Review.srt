1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,319
good morning folks all right so I'm

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,679
going to try to get through this rather

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,480
quickly some things have occurred while

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,439
I was asleep last night I want to look

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:19,680
into concerning the Middle East and

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,240
Israel and

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,160
whatnot the dollar

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,400
Index here on the weekly chart uh we hit

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
our objective the first objective which

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
was this candle's high on the weekly

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,760
chart so that high comes in at 107

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,680
274 and the week that we just closed its

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,440
high is 107.3 48 so just above it

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
reaching into this

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,559
inbalance now having the retracement

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,879
like we

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,239
saw and the lower close uh that to me is

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,519
perfectly acceptable I we've had 1 2 3 4

19
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:10,400
five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 weeks of buy side

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
delivery that's like 3 months of steady

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
oneway direction to a premium level and

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
it's reasonable to anticipate you know

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,079
something of a

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,320
retracement I'm not trying to pick the

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
top in the dollar as I mentioned many

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,840
times

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
before

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,600
incidentally uh you might want to take a

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,040
look at the economic calendar I'm not

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,560
going to show it here it's something

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
that you should be looking to do on your

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,079
own anyway day by day and for the week

33
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,640
to come always on the weekend uh try to

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,320
get a feel for what it's potentially

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
offering in terms of underlying risk

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,799
with the high impact news drivers or

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,360
medium impact news drivers or Fed chair

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,159
speakers something to that effect and

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,640
there's a lot of that next week so next

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,360
week week's trading will be laced with a

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
lot of

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,318
volatility Monday's a holiday so we're

43
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,959
going to have a pretty wild week to come

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,080
and with all the things that's just

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,319
popped off with the violence over in

46
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,200
Gaza and Israel um that's going to

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
increase tensions as well so I know it

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,599
sounds silly that you know those two

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,800
sides always have an issue with one

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,440
another um I do believe we're going to

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
see something

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,120
significant uh arise from all this so

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,599
for the folks that have been watching or

54
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,080
listening to the Twitter space I did

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,319
over a year ago um I told you about in

56
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,000
18 months from then we'd start seeing

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
some stuff going

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,440
on we're at it now okay so you just need

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,920
to be paying attention to it's going to

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,800
have its reverberations in the

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,680
marketplace it's going to have

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,800
reverberations where you live even

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,959
though it might be on the other side the

64
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,360
world that stuff's going to start

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
happening and impacting your everyday

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
life so daily chart you see we went

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
right up into that inefficiency right

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
above the high that we were looking for

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
or not the high but the low of the

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,640
inefficiency that's what's being

71
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,920
highlighted here and there was buy side

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,319
still that I have an interest

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
in we rallied

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,120
up Friday we went right up into this

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,400
small little Gap in here

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,360
to this candle's low this candle's High

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,360
non payroll sent it up and then rejected

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,239
it consequent encroachment of this

79
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Wick we'll highlight

80
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,799
that

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,319
so

82
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,959
105 90 and four pit

83
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,040
bets that's a that's a level of watch

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
see if there's any kind of reaction off

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
of that otherwise we could return back

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,120
down

87
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,680
[Music]

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,280
into this daily Gap okay so I'm going to

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,720
leave these levels here as they are

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,079
we're going to drop down into an hourly

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,798
chart you can see the effects of non

92
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,360
front payroll I did a quiet not

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
intentionally live stream uh the other

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
day and I talked for like an hour

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,919
thinking that the audio was good and

96
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,120
took the chance of assuming that it was

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
and like Murphy's La whatever can go

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
wrong did and I've done that in the past

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
with the recordings you pre-recorded

100
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,360
videos and some of them were rather long

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,240
and discovered after the fact that the

102
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,639
microphone was on mute or wasn't

103
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,479
connected or had an issue and didn't

104
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,440
pick up any of the audio so a little bit

105
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,960
of a annoyance but um I drew out key

106
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,039
levels for liquidity I mentioned this

107
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,320
one in here and I mentioned this one

108
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,680
here graph you buy

109
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
graphically depicting it on the chart

110
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,600
even though I wasn't saying audibly if

111
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
you're a student of mine you know

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,919
exactly what I'm drawing your attention

113
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,199
to the liquidity above and below and we

114
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,840
went right for it

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,280
again here on nonfarm payroll

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,199
numbers then rejected it so they pumped

117
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,000
it

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
up during the 8:30 even though it's

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
showing 8:00 it's an hourly candle so

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,880
it's including the post NFP number

121
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,360
release at 8:30 a.m. and then quickly

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
sent it lower attacking the cell side

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,280
here so here's

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,520
that consequent cor of that daily Wick

125
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,600
10594 and the daily Fair Gap

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,680
there and I mentioned how when we were

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,840
up in here just be mindful of this order

128
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,639
Block in here in that

129
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,039
Gap so

130
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,199
ahead of the nonr

131
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,560
payroll we working it trade down

132
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840
into the OR BL a little bit more and

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,960
then sent it up into buy side and then

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,840
rejected and sent it to the cell side

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
here going into next week you want to

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
have this level here

137
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,599
this

138
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,199
shaded area I'm going to look at that as

139
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,960
a potential inversion everybody out

140
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,880
going

141
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,280
forward so it could come back up trade

142
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
into the breaker which is high low

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,840
higher high it took liquidity this down

144
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,520
closed candle that is your breaker and

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,759
is inside of the lower end and lower

146
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,639
quadrant of this old inefficiency now

147
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,800
because we went through it it's

148
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,880
reasonable to anticipate lower price is

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,639
initially going into next week so if we

150
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,639
see a trade up into that that might be a

151
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,879
catalyst that send this lower if we

152
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,680
don't take out this low

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,879
first I like the idea of coming back up

154
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,599
in hitting the breaker touching this an

155
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,879
inversion fair value Gap and then

156
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,840
trading lower for the cell side worst

157
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,879
case scenario we open with a gap lower

158
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,840
and never return back into this area

159
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,680
here which is you know potential you you

160
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
never know where we're going to open up

161
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,440
on Sunday now because of all

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,080
the militaristic things that are going

163
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
on over in the Middle East uh those

164
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
types of things cause a lot of concern

165
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,360
and and they like to use those things to

166
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
to stimulate the marketplace so we might

167
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
see an extreme gap opening on Sunday as

168
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,639
a result to what's taking place last

169
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
night and what obviously we'll be going

170
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,919
on for the remainder of the weekend

171
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,599
going into next week

172
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,080
um let's go into the daily chart once

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,280
more and breeze on through to Euro I

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
don't want to spend too much time this

175
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
morning

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,199
so we had the relative equal lows we

177
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,639
mentioned that we traed down into it uh

178
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,199
my targets as I mentioned earlier in the

179
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,879
week uh I was done like everything was

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
met everything I outlined was was

181
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,240
delivered in price for the dollar Index

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280
the Euro for the pound

183
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,759
dollar uh Aussie dollar

184
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,680
um es and NASDAQ so everything I

185
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,080
mentioned with the exception of gold

186
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
gold didn't quite get down to that uh

187
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,799
180 for level yet so that was the only

188
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,760
thing that didn't really deliver thus

189
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,919
far but um pound dollar we saw I'm sorry

190
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,880
euro dollar we saw it delivered below

191
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
the cell side and came back up watch

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
this Gap in here once more and then the

193
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,279
order block right there so these These

194
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,680
are the PD arrays I'm

195
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,040
watching it's perfectly acceptable for

196
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,959
it to retrace back up to here and still

197
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,200
not really

198
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,399
have

199
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,560
anything in terms of a a confirmed

200
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
reversal it's really important that you

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
understand that I try to avoid what I'm

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,519
highlighting here is the order block

203
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,240
opening in the low these two consecutive

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,320
up closed candles that's your par sh

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,279
block which is above this Gap and this

206
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,399
shortterm high right there on that

207
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,560
candle is by side so those are the three

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,480
PD arrays in logic we've already traded

209
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,120
back to consequent encouragement of this

210
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
Wick

211
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,399
here so this is kind of like the line

212
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,480
the saying if we get above that and

213
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,200
um start to expand or you know

214
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,279
accelerate in terms of speed then it

215
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,839
might be much more uh deeper retracement

216
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,079
required and in that case we may have to

217
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,680
revisit

218
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,079
this okay so um if I were to be held to

219
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,279
tell me right now what makes you

220
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,399
confident that we probably made a an

221
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,600
important low for the rest of the year

222
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,640
and it goes higher from where we're at

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,920
it needs to take out this high and then

224
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,480
once it goes above this inefficiency

225
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,920
should it ever do it this year or the

226
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
remainder of this year in 2023 we hit it

227
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,680
in active support once it starts doing

228
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,240
that then and only then would I'd

229
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,959
qualify that as a a low of any real

230
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
significance I I try to teach the

231
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,480
avoidance of trying to pick tops and

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,399
bottoms um because it's a skill set that

233
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,839
you're not going to be consistent with

234
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,279
no one's going to be that consistent

235
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,560
with it

236
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
and I'll just leave it at that okay so

237
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,120
it's not important that you try to get

238
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,440
that type of uh Turning Point you want

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,079
to trade in a direction of order flow

240
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,959
which removes a lot of the concern for

241
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,360
being

242
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,079
perfect all right so here is the

243
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,480
business on the houry chart on

244
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,839
Euro you can see we traded down took out

245
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,399
the cell side here and went right down

246
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,680
to that old

247
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,399
low nailing it here and here the old low

248
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
on the daily chart that's what we were

249
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
looking to see it sweep below that's

250
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
what that level is and it hits it

251
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,480
beautifully then runs back above so

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,839
there's buy side here so just be mindful

253
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,160
of

254
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,519
that that might be what we probably Gap

255
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,480
above you I wouldn't be surprised if we

256
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
end up gapping above or gapping close to

257
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
this and then running a little bit

258
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,360
higher on

259
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,600
Sunday daily charts go back up

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,320
to that Ty frame and look at the pound

261
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,839
dollar all right so pounded again what

262
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,079
we were looking for we were looking for

263
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,920
lower prices um it's acted much like the

264
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,720
NASDAQ in relationship to the es whereas

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,519
pound dollar was a little reluctant to

266
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,360
go lower in sympathy with the euro

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,320
dollar with the um run to our premium

268
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,920
Target on the dollar index that daily

269
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,360
inefficiency where we trade to it this

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,600
week and then we've been selling off

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,880
since

272
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,839
then the wick and consequent

273
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,600
encouragement of that you know we have

274
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
to watch this this is going to be going

275
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,959
into or we open next week and we could

276
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,360
revisit back

277
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,160
into shorter time frame premium arras

278
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,760
again avoiding the entire idea of

279
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,160
picking the bottom okay I'm not I'm not

280
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,120
trying to support the idea of anyone

281
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,560
doing that and I don't try to do that

282
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,959
myself so longer term I'm still focusing

283
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
here

284
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
and you know for three months straight

285
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
dollar Index going up having one weekly

286
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
down close doesn't change the trend for

287
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,680
me so if it's going to have a

288
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,639
retracement then it's going to be seen

289
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,480
you conversely with other Forex paays so

290
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,760
they're going to have a little bit of a

291
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,399
you know retrace as well but avoid the

292
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,000
whole idea of trying to pick a top and

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,920
and bottom respectively to those markets

294
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,079
longer term I'm still focused down here

295
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,320
for sell

296
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,199
side and let's take a quick look at

297
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,480
Aussie

298
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,639
dollar I was looking for the sell side

299
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,240
to be upset on that market and we showed

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,279
it the other day and we we got it here

301
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,040
so as long as we stay below these uh

302
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,639
these highs here I think we're lower you

303
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,480
know across the board for Aussie I liked

304
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,600
how we went back up in this

305
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,760
inefficiency so have this on your chart

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,600
if we resume higher on dollar next

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,480
week and we don't really move outside of

308
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,519
this and efficiency on the

309
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,920
upside we'll be looking for lower prices

310
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,360
on Australian dollar down to get into

311
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,560
this sell side right there okay that

312
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,800
kind of gives you an idea if we break

313
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
above these

314
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
highs I would not be interested in

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
Aussie dollar at all all so I'd like to

316
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
see it remain heavy and bearish and

317
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,240
eventually you know reach below here

318
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
otherwise I would not want to be buying

319
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,639
going long on doy dollar just not

320
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,000
interested I'm not trading Forex at all

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,199
anymore but I know you all like to hear

322
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,839
my opinion about it so that's that gold

323
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,720
we'll do that one real

324
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,560
quick all right and as I mentioned in

325
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
the live streams um

326
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
in the recent weeks I said that gold

327
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,160
would be looking to trade down into this

328
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
inefficiency between this candle's low

329
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,519
this candle's High that's why this is

330
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,720
being shaded here um once we broke

331
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,440
through it it would act as an inversion

332
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,560
fair value Gap we opened on this day

333
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,240
trade up into it broke

334
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,639
lower the order

335
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,240
blocks and the sell side was the

336
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,680
relative equal lows that was where I was

337
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,279
taking your attention to um this was the

338
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,680
very shortterm Target

339
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,360
we didn't get that on Friday non front

340
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
payroll came in and did its thing and

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,639
ultimately I still think that this is a

342
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,040
viable

343
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,240
Target and let's see where we at

344
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,630
um let's do

345
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,000
[Music]

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
es

347
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,600
[Music]

348
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,040
right

349
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,560
okay so es we traded

350
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,600
into our old inefficiency

351
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,679
[Music]

352
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,120
here body stayed inside that we had

353
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,319
Candlestick Tails or or Wix however you

354
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,440
want to refer to it it's it's the bodies

355
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
are telling you the narrative so if we

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,759
have a deeper retracement it's perfectly

357
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,319
acceptable for it to come back up into

358
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,839
this area

359
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,680
here so my eye is on this

360
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,480
inefficiency right

361
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,040
there

362
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,959
so it can trade up in the that

363
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,040
inefficiency and it still by my

364
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,319
definition hasn't reversed and it would

365
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,680
be complet completely acceptable so I

366
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,279
could trade up here and then end up

367
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,800
trading lower uh these lows here just a

368
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,120
little too clean for my liking and over

369
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,160
here so sell side in here and this low

370
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,199
is my focus longer term um I'm

371
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,920
completely willing to be proven wrong

372
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,800
because you know on a daily

373
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,360
chart these ideas tend

374
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
to pan out over a longer period of time

375
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,519
it's a lot more forgiving as well in

376
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
terms of a missed move or if you do

377
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
something wrong with the

378
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,919
analysis you can get yourself back in

379
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,559
sync and then trade once you get better

380
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,959
visibility of what the Market's likely

381
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,720
to do uh right now I'm I'm still holding

382
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,799
and subscribing to the idea that nothing

383
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,359
has changed to bullish there's

384
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,559
absolutely zero reasons for anyone to be

385
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
bullish on stocks I mean there's nothing

386
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,199
there's literally nothing for anyone to

387
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,240
be at these multiples you if you're

388
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,880
going to talk about things fundamentally

389
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
it's absurd

390
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
where these stocks are still trading it

391
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
it's ridiculous and at some point you

392
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,559
know the the chickens are going to come

393
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,280
home to roost and that means you know

394
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,440
things are going to have to hit the

395
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,480
reality and lower prices are in

396
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,200
order so try to avoid all this business

397
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,640
in here I don't think we're done and

398
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,000
lower prices is where I'm focusing but

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,840
this short-term likelihood of a

400
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,080
retracement it's completely within the

401
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,030
realm of possibility uh 60-minute

402
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:07,440
[Music]

403
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,440
chart all right and here is saleside non

404
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,200
foray roll drop down into

405
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,520
that hit the order block

406
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,480
here rallied

407
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
up obvious buy side waiting right here

408
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,860
with an inefficiency over

409
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,000
[Music]

410
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,240
here so you want to have this on your

411
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,000
chart going forward into next

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,280
week and again with everything that's

413
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,520
going

414
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,720
on geopolitically speaking um you we

415
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,640
could really see an extreme gap opening

416
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,679
on Sunday so um and it could be either

417
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,400
direction so I'm expecting a lot of

418
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,640
difference between where we settled on

419
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,320
Friday and where we open because it

420
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
could it could do either one I tend to

421
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,840
think that this was all pumped up ahead

422
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
of all the economic news

423
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
drivers that are due out and all the the

424
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
speeches that's going to be had

425
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,559
on the trading week that's coming

426
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,559
so just be mindful that this is

427
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,799
classically what's seen with non-ir

428
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,280
payroll in my opinion um they take the

429
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,240
market in a Direction which many times

430
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,799
is like a a fake

431
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,360
out okay just like I teach that the nonr

432
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,600
payroll and the rate announcements for

433
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,400
fomc um they are two stage de U

434
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,880
deliveries whereas initially we see the

435
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,919
market

436
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
drop at nonr payroll so that's the first

437
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
stage and then the second stage is the

438
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
reversal of that move and then you see

439
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,679
it happening here every single time we

440
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,520
sit down and do fomc analysis or if I've

441
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,840
done them live streaming you watching it

442
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,159
happen with you over shoulder um it it's

443
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,880
always the case where it's two-stage

444
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,919
delivery and it was just like this again

445
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,720
over Friday the only thing it was a

446
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,679
little bit surprising is they took a

447
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,720
whole lot of distance in like 2 minutes

448
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,679
you know a very very short time they

449
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:19,760
they covered

450
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,240
175 handles and that's you know a

451
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,559
wonderful illustration of why you need

452
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,120
to be respecting the measure of risk

453
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,880
with this particular because it can harm

454
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,640
you and your stop- loss won't work like

455
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,640
it won't work in the first minute it GED

456
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,960
down ad

457
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,080
handles on

458
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,880
NASDAQ so you know that's that's pretty

459
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,840
significant drop and no one can really

460
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,880
you know tolerate that if they're doing

461
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
15

462
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,840
contracts that's a that's a that's a big

463
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,280
smack in the

464
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,120
face keep my wife's name out of your

465
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,000
mouth

466
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,120
so

467
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,640
the buy side here they went they ran on

468
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,880
it aggressively and I talked about

469
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,559
how the market would likely close in its

470
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,200
upper 50% upper 60% of its range and U

471
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,760
we we got that so it's all in the live

472
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
stream and I'm not trying to try to say

473
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,799
face here

474
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,799
because everything I said in the live

475
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,440
stream you're welcome to go and listen

476
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
to it for the nonr peoll live stream

477
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,039
where I was watching it live with you

478
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,279
the things that would be concerning

479
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,480
things that would be utilized for

480
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
reading price you know all that stuff is

481
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
in that live stream so you can listen to

482
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,039
and revisit whatever you want to take

483
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,200
away from

484
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,760
it the drop again at

485
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,279
8:30 that was the first stage delivery

486
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,200
it means it's the fake drop it's the

487
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,679
fake move it's the thing that's most

488
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,760
likely going to be faded in the rest of

489
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,559
the day we see that happening here 8:30

490
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,679
look at the

491
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,320
high up here upper left hand

492
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,559
corner that comes in at 4294 even and

493
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,880
the low comes in at 4248 and a

494
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,159
quarter that's a that's a significant

495
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,440
amount of handles for

496
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,760
S&P at $50 per point or handle you know

497
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,799
it doesn't take long to to go into a

498
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,159
significant draw

499
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,799
down swing High Here let take that off

500
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,960
here

501
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,159
swing High taken here so there's a shift

502
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,400
in Market structure that low to that

503
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,279
high as it's retracing what's it

504
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,520
reaching

505
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,679
for inefficiency right here and Order

506
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,880
block the last down closed

507
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
candle

508
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,760
note the

509
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
bodies where they reside inside that

510
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,520
fair Val you

511
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
got see

512
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,400
that zo me a little bit so you can see

513
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,170
it

514
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,840
[Music]

515
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,039
better so even though we went outside

516
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,240
that's a mohawk it's just a little tiny

517
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,679
coloring Outside the Lines it's t it's

518
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,000
typical and then we rally up order block

519
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
touched body both on these candles

520
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,279
signifying that okay we're probably

521
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,640
going to run higher so where's it going

522
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,279
to

523
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,440
run rebalance all this and go back to

524
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,200
the previous day settlement so

525
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,120
using what I teach in terms of the riv

526
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
of trading

527
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
hours where we settled the previous day

528
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
here on

529
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,400
Thursday it trades right back up into it

530
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
there okay and you need not see it trade

531
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,600
above here or here to be profitable

532
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,720
all right let's go into a one minute

533
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,159
chart and we'll take a look at

534
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,190
the Silver

535
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,289
[Music]

536
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,159
Bullet

537
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,159
okay the fair value Gap we drop down

538
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,840
into it we don't get a shift in Market

539
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,399
structure until I mean this is

540
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,000
technically it's a a shift to Market

541
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,480
structure Above This High rate there and

542
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,440
they used the higher time frame 5 minute

543
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,000
Fair got which really could have been

544
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,480
refined to inside here so dropping down

545
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,039
lower time

546
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,840
frames on a moment chart you would have

547
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,919
that that would be a little bit bit

548
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,000
concerning for me there so again it

549
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,840
would have to show willingness to want

550
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,720
to go higher and it does that with this

551
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,880
swing High being broken

552
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,840
there and the

553
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,799
underlying premise would be this was the

554
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,880
first stage delivery and the second

555
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,919
stage would be moving back up and I

556
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,559
mentioned on the live stream that you

557
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,399
know it might not go above and go higher

558
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,240
it could just go up here rebalance and

559
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
then consolidate because it's Friday it

560
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,000
is

561
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,399
um on the heels of nonfarm

562
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,360
payroll we've covered a lot of distance

563
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,880
and we had already had a intra week

564
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
retracement from Dollar targets es

565
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,360
targets so one of those things were

566
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,000
likely to be a catalyst to cause us to

567
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,039
be content with consolidating but

568
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,039
they've taken it a great deal higher

569
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,520
which you to me looking at it now it

570
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,799
feels like it's all you know fluff

571
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,120
they're you they're fluffing it up going

572
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,360
into next week and next week you know

573
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,200
major damage is going to be done and I

574
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,520
could be wrong it could be sending it

575
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,360
even higher aggressively higher you know

576
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,679
and it's okay you know as long as it's

577
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,320
moving around I don't care I'll find

578
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
something I'll get in there and do

579
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,840
something but we want to try to have a a

580
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,480
good read on it using the daily charts

581
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
and it makes things a lot better when it

582
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,039
is in concert with what we have expected

583
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,480
or expect with the weekly chart so

584
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,760
that's why I'm saying ahead of

585
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,919
the new week where I don't know where

586
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,799
we're going to open but I think we're

587
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,919
going to have a big gap opening one

588
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,880
extreme or the other above or below on

589
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,919
all the markets

590
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,360
um but I think we'll have a very

591
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,679
volatile week and I'd like to

592
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,480
see initially I'd like to see it retrace

593
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,760
a little bit further lower on dollar to

594
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,000
kind of like sell the idea that it

595
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,159
topped to retail Traders and everybody

596
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,840
else go long still at these elevated

597
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,320
levels on ES NASDAQ Forex paays and then

598
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,039
and

599
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,320
gold and then they send it lower

600
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,120
aggressively next week you know by next

601
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Friday's close you know I would like to

602
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,240
see lower levels on all the uh Forex

603
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
Pairs and on ES and NASDAQ and gold and

604
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,080
higher prices on dollar Index that's

605
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,039
what I'd like to see uh but I have to

606
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,840
have the alignment with the technicals

607
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,399
and what price is doing when it's time

608
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,760
to expect it to be delivering so this is

609
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,000
a matter of waiting and seeing so going

610
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
into next week that's what I'm

611
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
expecting but we see a trade back down

612
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,279
into that inefficiency here and then it

613
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,640
starts to really ramp up and that occurs

614
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,000
at

615
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,600
1021 okay so um what you what you don't

616
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,840
understand is this is a silver bullet

617
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,919
because it's using a fair value Gap even

618
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,279
though the fair value Gap is outside and

619
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,960
before 10:00 and this is part of the

620
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,519
rules go back and listen to the

621
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,039
recording the fair value Gap does not

622
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,399
need to be inside of 10 to 11 the setup

623
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,000
is a retracement into a fair Val got

624
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,360
between 10 and 11

625
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,960
so seeing that is the case and we're

626
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,039
seeing it rally up if you didn't take

627
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,080
this one in

628
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,840
here you could use this

629
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
one

630
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,519
and it found its opportunity to drop

631
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,000
down into consequent encouragement which

632
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,840
is midpoint of that Gap here with the

633
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,080
expectation that we would see it at

634
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,799
least run back

635
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,120
to the previous day settlement by using

636
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,679
regular trading hours which right now

637
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,039
we're toggled at electronic trading

638
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,159
hours so from here to where regular

639
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,200
trading hours previous settlement price

640
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
all offered room to Rally which would be

641
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,919
going above this high and maybe maybe

642
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,320
reaching above here if you're so

643
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,120
inclined to hold

644
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
that but silver bolet we're only looking

645
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,440
for five handles and as a as a minimum

646
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
and it offered it here so it end up

647
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
keeping you you held on to it it's

648
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,550
that's a pretty good

649
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,299
[Music]

650
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,320
run and settling on the

651
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,200
close and here's your Silver Bullet at

652
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,440
the 2:00 hour here that fair value got

653
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,880
all right so let's go up to the daily

654
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,440
chart and do next I can be done with

655
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,919
this all right there's a whole lot of

656
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,800
business going on in this one isn't

657
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,559
[Music]

658
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,559
it all right so I wanted to see it trade

659
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,519
down into this inefficiency um we have

660
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,519
returned back into this area right up in

661
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,840
here so I'm going to add

662
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,320
this for the sake of this

663
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,840
analysis okay so we traded up into that

664
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,600
inefficiency

665
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,640
there we

666
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,039
are avoiding trying to pick the bottoms

667
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,960
okay um again I feel like this was all

668
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,600
part of this consolidation Trail stop

669
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,679
losses were brought down to here and

670
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,880
also getting up into this inefficiency

671
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,720
perfect excuse for them to have run

672
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,440
liquidity for anyone that's been

673
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,799
trailing it because I believe that we

674
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,519
might be seeing a larger selloff coming

675
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,120
okay and and this would be classic

676
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,320
scenario for that very thing so we've

677
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,159
Consolidated everyone wanted to see it

678
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,279
drop lower I wanted to see it drop lower

679
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,679
but it just wouldn't drop doesn't mean

680
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,200
we couldn't find setups obviously we've

681
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,799
outlined it you saw me executing you saw

682
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,320
me doing things with it and long story

683
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,960
short where we're at by taking the buy

684
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
side of above these highs here and back

685
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,519
into this inefficiency this upsets

686
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,960
anyone that has been short so now if we

687
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,679
are going to see a lower deliveri and

688
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,120
price on the indices specifically NASDAQ

689
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,840
I'd like to see it be trading down

690
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,720
here um that would be perfect

691
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,159
engineering of sending it higher getting

692
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,720
everybody thinking that we're you know

693
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,679
we're bullish when we're not I'm not

694
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
bullish on NASDAQ I'm bearish it doesn't

695
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,559
mean that I won't take

696
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,000
Longs okay um it just means that they

697
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,559
have to be intraday scalps because it's

698
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,080
going against my higher time frame order

699
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,639
flow and bias and the narrative I think

700
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,399
is that we went higher to upset the

701
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,360
shorts knock them out and if they buy

702
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,600
stops that are being trailed while

703
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,799
they're bearish if they buy stops being

704
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,840
triggered Above This

705
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,000
High those buy stops are being

706
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,240
accumulated as smart money for shorts

707
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,080
like that's how I'm that's the internal

708
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,039
dialogue that I'm holding when I see

709
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,720
this chart as it is so I know there's a

710
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,519
whole lot of this stuff here cuz I don't

711
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,480
have it set to only show on specific

712
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,320
time frames and I just wanted to go out

713
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
here and do this because I want to spend

714
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,360
a lot of time studying what's going on

715
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,799
over in the Middle East because I want

716
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,600
to talk about it on Sunday on a Twitter

717
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,919
space maybe but the

718
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,600
uh the idea I'm holding here is we went

719
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
up just to go down that that's kind of

720
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,639
like what I'm suggesting here until I'm

721
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,760
proven wrong you what would make that

722
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,519
you know a

723
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,720
truth this inefficiency if he trade

724
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,120
above it and it touches it and starts to

725
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,080
show uh some support starts to Rally

726
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,559
then I'll concede and say I'm wrong and

727
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,880
you maybe something underlying did occur

728
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,200
down here that I

729
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,519
missed and then we're going to go higher

730
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,120
there's a whole lot of things in motion

731
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,320
right now and geopolitically um with

732
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,039
Russia and China

733
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,960
there's so many things so many things

734
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,000
that makes it very complex to have a

735
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,279
macro read from a weekly and daily that

736
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,279
has a longterm time Horizon that won't

737
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,440
be met with

738
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,679
shortterm disruptions that May

739
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,480
challenge the opinion or sentiment idea

740
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,519
of someone that's been doing a lot less

741
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,519
so I'm leaning on the fact that I know

742
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,480
that this is the climate for that to

743
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
occur

744
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,559
meaning I see in the chart that it's not

745
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:37,320
enough for me to trust that it's made a

746
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,639
low like in other words I don't see it

747
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,639
from where we are right now I don't see

748
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:44,600
it trading to make a new high up here

749
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,919
okay um I don't see

750
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,679
it as bullish I just see it as going up

751
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,120
to get ready to have

752
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,960
another a sharper drop lower

753
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,000
okay and if I'm wrong it's fine it's

754
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,720
okay I mean it's good for you to see me

755
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,960
get it

756
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,230
wrong doesn't happen all that

757
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,240
[Music]

758
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,000
often it sounds irant I know but it's

759
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,760
the truth so anyway the hourly chart we

760
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,560
had the buy side in here we finally got

761
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,918
that level tagged but not before seeing

762
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,719
the drop below here taking out cells

763
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,119
side and rally up uh this opening range

764
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,599
Gap that level I I taught how to

765
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,839
determine what that is and it's again

766
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,760
using the regular trading

767
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,159
hours here so that was Thursday where we

768
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,639
settled and then on

769
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,199
Friday where we opened at 9:30 we had an

770
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,399
opening Gap so it makes it the opening

771
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,440
Gap High why because we open down below

772
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,359
it remember we start this annotation

773
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,000
with opening range Gap

774
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,480
settlement so as soon as we get to

775
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,119
around 9:15 or so right before several

776
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,200
minutes before the opening bell at 9:30

777
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
eastern time uh that'll tell you what

778
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,040
it's likely to do and since we had a gap

779
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,079
opening lower we went down took out the

780
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,520
previous day's

781
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,440
low Wicked through it and then came back

782
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,359
that that trade here that was the

783
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,640
premise I was working with okay so for

784
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,839
um

785
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,040
I'll get to it in a second relative

786
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
equal highs there's b side there and

787
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,599
then there's this actual gap which is a

788
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,680
real liquidity void okay um when you see

789
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,720
these single candles like that okay

790
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,079
technically that is not a liquidity void

791
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,400
a liquidity void is where there's

792
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
absolutely zero trading going on between

793
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,319
two candlesticks or two time frames so

794
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,240
this duration of time measurement on

795
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,599
that candle on an hourly basis and then

796
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,040
the next candle here there is no trading

797
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,640
at all

798
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,119
between these two price points this

799
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,160
candle's this candle's low and that

800
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,200
candle's high so this is a real

801
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,079
liquidity void and the price gets itself

802
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,440
worked into buy side delivery here so my

803
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,800
question to you is

804
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,560
this if this was a real Gap and it is

805
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,040
obviously if it trades up into it here

806
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
with buy side what would make it a

807
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,599
balance price range sell side so I'm

808
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,839
expecting price to want to pass that it

809
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:38,359
back down into this range because every

810
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,119
Gap should be or every

811
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,119
inefficiency and or Gap should be

812
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,200
delivered with both up and down price

813
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
action so a a buy side delivery as

814
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,319
Market goes up through

815
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:54,960
one range defined as we have here the

816
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,079
difference between this candle's high

817
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,920
and that candle's low low there's no

818
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,560
there's no trading there no one had a

819
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,599
trade there no one had a fill no one was

820
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,000
selling short or buying long no one was

821
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,839
closing trades there there was literally

822
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,040
nothing being booked between these two

823
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,440
candles that's what makes this a

824
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,920
liquidity void it's void of

825
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,560
liquidity so what will happen is the

826
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,200
market algorithm will deliver price to

827
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,400
and through that range and what has it

828
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,599
done so far on the hourly chart it's

829
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,599
only delivered with buy side

830
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,280
delivery not liquidity by side delivery

831
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
that means price has booked delivering

832
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,079
price as it goes up so it's reasonable

833
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,000
to expect it to drop back down for the

834
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,680
sake of offering both buy side and sell

835
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
side and then once that occurs then the

836
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,319
real narrative will be in play do we go

837
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:46,319
higher or do we go lower and when we

838
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,760
leave that range that's shaded here it

839
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,319
will act as a balanc price range and

840
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,160
whatever Direction it works from after

841
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,200
the balance price range is established

842
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,680
that's probably going to be the the

843
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,400
price run that has a lot more

844
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,599
sustainability versus right now I'm

845
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,480
speculating and not really having a clue

846
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,560
what it wants to do exactly going into

847
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,880
the opening on Sunday like we don't know

848
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,160
what it's going to do no one knows what

849
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,640
it's going to do but I do expect an

850
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,760
extreme gap opening because of all the

851
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,599
things that's going on right

852
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,800
now all right 15 minute time

853
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,079
frame okay so here is our Gap here and

854
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,720
again showing rular trading hours this

855
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
was Thursday

856
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,760
settlement and then when we open down

857
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,480
here so that opening range Gap is from

858
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,160
here and the opening of that

859
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,599
candle then we had this inefficiency

860
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,920
here and then the new week opening Gap

861
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,359
and its consequent encroachment in that

862
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,319
buy side that we were talking about all

863
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,079
this week finally got its rear end

864
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,280
smoked and then powered through it so

865
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,200
again here's that inefficiency I

866
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,119
mentioned that is a real liquidity void

867
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,800
that by side was delivered to look at

868
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
the the reaction

869
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,040
here that trading right there reaction

870
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,440
there is that low of the liquidity void

871
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,119
on the hourly

872
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,319
chart so you have to have these

873
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,160
understood visually it's probably going

874
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,720
to be helpful to you if you have them

875
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
drawn on your

876
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,000
chart if I was awake and I was sleeping

877
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,280
during this

878
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,880
time I I was trying to take a nap but I

879
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,480
ended up sleeping over 5 hours so I was

880
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,599
apparently in need of rest but I wasn't

881
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,079
able to see any of this stuff here in

882
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,599
the afternoon so it would have been

883
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,839
something I would have liked to take a

884
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,760
trade on um I would have done this here

885
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,520
like as this candle opened and dropped

886
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
down into the order block there I would

887
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,480
have used that to go long trusting that

888
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,119
these lows here wouldn't be touched

889
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,240
again because it's the low of the

890
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,000
liquidity void on the hourly chart which

891
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,599
is a a range that's defined where there

892
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,720
absolutely zero trading just like there

893
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,640
is no trading

894
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,079
here see

895
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,079
that

896
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,880
so a good example of what I'm talking

897
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,839
about where there's a liquidity void

898
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,760
there's one right here okay look at it

899
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,160
here from that candle's low I'm sorry

900
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,640
that candle's high and that candle's low

901
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,359
we'll extend it out in

902
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,880
time

903
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,319
so what's missing in here buy side and

904
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,920
sell side delivery so there's no up or

905
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,520
close candlesticks or

906
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,040
Wicks until we get down here so we see

907
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,760
it trade down into it

908
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,240
here we see a trade down into it here

909
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,839
look where the bodies are stopping you

910
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,280
see that that's not

911
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,400
random move down again the bodies are

912
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,280
staying

913
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,760
where inside of that real liquidity void

914
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,160
Chris Lor is not going to teach it like

915
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
that okay and I know that sounds

916
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,079
disrespectful but I'm so tired

917
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,480
of hearing people say that I regurgitate

918
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,400
or teach what he's taught because I had

919
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,880
the man himself come out on Twitter and

920
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,920
tell you all publicly it ain't

921
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,400
it this when we leave it okay we've

922
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,920
taken out the cell side here we Trad it

923
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,480
back down into an inefficiency that's a

924
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,880
larger time

925
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,000
frame then we leave

926
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,400
it this energetic

927
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,280
runaway makes this a balanced price

928
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,520
range this Gap here what is it missing

929
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,000
buy side not any longer it's been

930
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,359
offered there so in this area here

931
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,680
between this candle's low and this

932
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,720
candle's

933
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,000
high it's missing what sell-side

934
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,839
delivery it means down delivery price

935
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,920
moving lower so in my mind here's how

936
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm visually thinking about this as I'm

937
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
talking about it live with you well live

938
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,280
in this recording right um it's 8:00 in

939
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,480
the morning on Saturday

940
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,520
so that's as live as going to

941
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,240
get so the market is uh being pumped up

942
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,680
ahead of next week's economic calendar

943
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,359
and I believe because we have a short

944
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,520
week because Monday's a holiday I

945
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,079
believe that we will see

946
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,240
acceleration in terms of volatility and

947
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,880
I believe that all this is

948
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,440
fluff in this area down here

949
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,640
will be needed to be

950
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,200
Revisited so I'll highlight that now so

951
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
it's on my

952
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,119
chart and everything else I'll remove

953
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,000
that's not Salient like for instance

954
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,319
this opening range Gap High I don't need

955
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:43,599
that anymore um actually I'm going to

956
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,640
keep it on here for a moment um

957
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,180
the five minute

958
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,400
[Music]

959
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,400
chart in

960
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,119
here you can see how we we we trade down

961
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,839
into that inefficiency after taking sell

962
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,760
side on the Thursday low in the morning

963
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,920
session we rout it

964
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,599
up 11:00 we have a fair value Gap with a

965
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,240
breaker so we have this high low high

966
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,559
lower

967
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,480
low and I apologize it's it's a lot

968
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,079
of lipstick on this I apolog

969
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,839
but I want to get through it and usually

970
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,520
I would have all these things removed so

971
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,640
that way I can take your focus right to

972
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,839
the only thing I want you to be looking

973
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,800
at as I'm talking and that's why I do it

974
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,720
with PowerPoint makes it a lot easier it

975
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,040
makes it like very streamline for me to

976
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,760
teach but whenever I'm going over charts

977
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,319
live like this um and I'm pulling out

978
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,200
what I see is as it's happening it's a

979
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,240
little bit more organic you know some of

980
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,880
you like it like that um but for the

981
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,720
folks that tend to complain that I go on

982
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,760
and on and on uh because I I love

983
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,839
teaching and I want you to know

984
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,160
everything about what it is I'm talking

985
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,359
about not just be familiar with it and

986
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,720
give you a false sense of security like

987
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,960
you understand how to do it because you

988
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,520
watch me discuss something in an

989
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,640
abbreviated tense um that that's not

990
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,400
really learning and that's not someone

991
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,119
that's willing to put in what's required

992
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,200
as at work but the breaker here and I

993
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,160
know some of you're like well why you

994
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,599
highlighting the down Clos candle I say

995
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,720
t why aren't you doing the up Clos

996
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,319
candle because we're looking at a f-

997
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:24,640
minute chart so inside that highest up

998
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
closed candle I'm sorry that up that the

999
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,760
highest candle in a FIV minute chart

1000
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,520
there's going to be an up close candle

1001
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,000
in that on one minute chart just give me

1002
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,240
a moment okay I already know what you're

1003
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,480
thinking I already know the questions

1004
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,119
you got popping up in your head you can

1005
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,559
see how we worked in that fair B got

1006
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,119
right there there so institutional order

1007
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,400
entry drill here and here and then we

1008
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,319
send price higher it's also occurring at

1009
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,520
what price

1010
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,760
level what's going on in

1011
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,119
here we have the new week opening Gap

1012
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,319
low consequent encroach of the new week

1013
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:00,800
opening Gap and then the new week

1014
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,720
opening Gap high so between the new week

1015
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,440
opening Gap low and its consequent

1016
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
encouragement or midpoint level what

1017
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,880
level is that between these two halfway

1018
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,680
it's the lower quadrant and that's what

1019
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,040
you're seeing

1020
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,920
there so when you have a bias when you

1021
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,480
have a narrative in play that you think

1022
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,960
that the market will deliver either on a

1023
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,359
buy side run or sell Side

1024
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:24,880
Run and you're inside of an

1025
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,160
inefficiency you need to be cognizant of

1026
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,800
that the grading of that range or

1027
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,280
inefficiency is not quarter Theory we're

1028
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
using logic based on inefficiencies and

1029
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,280
or a range that is implied it may not be

1030
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,240
there technically yet and that's what I

1031
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,440
talk about in my core content lessons

1032
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,040
grading a price r that is not quarters

1033
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,319
Theory even though I'm talking about a

1034
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,440
quadrant of a specific range

1035
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,800
go and look at go study quarters Theory

1036
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,160
and you'll be just like I've told you

1037
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,359
with everything else it's not white offl

1038
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,280
it's not supply and demand it's not

1039
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,160
Elliot wave it's not none of that stuff

1040
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,880
this is absolutely the market this is

1041
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,079
what the algorithm is doing everything

1042
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,240
else is going to explain things

1043
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,680
perfectly in

1044
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,079
hindsight I'm telling you what to do and

1045
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,920
look for before it happens I'm doing on

1046
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,240
all time frames in live streams in

1047
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
pre-recorded analysis and you watch it

1048
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,800
pan out that's bending time and space

1049
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,680
so anyway I'm going ready to go into

1050
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,160
Twitter mode and start going off but let

1051
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,000
me just reel myself in here Lord help me

1052
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,359
so the market rallies up we have an

1053
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,280
inefficiency here and we trade to that

1054
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,319
as

1055
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,960
well and just a real nice run price

1056
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,079
higher up

1057
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,119
into the inefficiency that it has tagged

1058
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:54,440
as I mentioned we on on a higher time

1059
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,319
frame so here is the business for the

1060
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,040
quote unquote ICT student on Twitter

1061
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,400
that said I got it wrong um I want to

1062
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,840
pay attention now okay pay

1063
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,119
[Music]

1064
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,920
attention because I said in the live

1065
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,280
stream for the uh nonr payroll it's a

1066
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,880
two-stage delivery okay so it's a

1067
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,319
two-stage delivery meaning that it will

1068
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,000
likely do what feed the first move just

1069
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,480
like fomc teach you when the rate

1070
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,680
announcement comes out the 2:00 run to

1071
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,440
2:30 that's the fake move so you have to

1072
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,960
determine what what did they do between

1073
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,920
2:00 and 2:30 during the rate

1074
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,520
announcements nonfarm payroll is the

1075
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,640
same macro it's the same thing that

1076
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,559
they're doing the first run not all the

1077
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,920
time predominantly yes but most

1078
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,839
cases the first run at 8:30 when the

1079
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:55,079
news is hitting the wires whatever that

1080
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,359
direction is in price that is the fake

1081
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,800
move that's the first stage delivery the

1082
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,520
second stage is the opposite of whatever

1083
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,720
that is meaning we saw price do what it

1084
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,800
drops

1085
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,559
down gets everybody thinking okay it's

1086
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,440
going to go lower it crushes everyone

1087
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,960
that's already

1088
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,200
long and it did so in stunning fashion

1089
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,880
very quickly which scares everyone in

1090
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,880
the marketplace it terrifies them then

1091
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,280
the market does the second stage which

1092
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,920
is opposing what the 830

1093
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,440
news sentiment shift caused everyone to

1094
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,680
think that it would keep going lower

1095
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,079
keep going lower keep going

1096
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,880
lower they trapped them short and then

1097
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,440
they run against the move that took

1098
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,960
place in the morning so um pay attention

1099
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,240
you see that right

1100
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,319
there here see let me show it to you

1101
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:52,599
again here look at that you see that

1102
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:56,520
right there that's not Market replay

1103
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,839
that's not Market Replay that is not

1104
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:03,200
Market replay folks okay so what that is

1105
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,200
is me trading using the logic of the

1106
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,160
first stage delivery down

1107
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,799
here let me go into electronic trading

1108
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,720
hours okay and I'm looking at Price

1109
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,079
anticipating that it's going to use

1110
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,280
these wicks in here okay um I want to I

1111
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,559
want know that I'm on side before I do

1112
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,319
this because non payroll can trick

1113
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,359
me sometimes it just will behave in a

1114
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:37,240
manner where I will get smoked if I

1115
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,760
allow them to do it to me you know it's

1116
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,520
it's me to blame right so because I

1117
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,040
outlined you

1118
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,040
know the the second stage is opposite to

1119
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,040
what you see in the morning at

1120
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,040
8:30 on these big news

1121
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,400
drivers I felt that it was something

1122
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,280
that would be reasonable for it to trade

1123
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,920
up to the opening range Gap High that's

1124
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,200
that level right here okay and again let

1125
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,960
me take you back to electron um sorry

1126
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,559
regular trading hours and see where it's

1127
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,680
anchored here is the Thursday settlement

1128
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,960
price so that's the Gap from where we

1129
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,839
opened on Friday down here at 9:30 so

1130
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,359
that Gap I was looking for that Gap

1131
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,040
closure I'll have to put this back in a

1132
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,240
second I was looking for the price to

1133
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,319
run

1134
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:25,559
here and obviously as I mentioned I was

1135
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,720
tired so I put the order on put the

1136
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,640
limit order on to stop and if it would

1137
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,079
have been stopped out I would have

1138
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,680
showed you here you go here's what

1139
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,760
happened but here is what happened the

1140
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,839
price ran up to closing that Gap but

1141
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,599
more specifically I wanted to see it

1142
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,720
trade and give me a limit exit just

1143
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,359
below that opening range Gap high so

1144
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:53,040
that's why you see my exit is

1145
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,440
14, 856 and A4 whereas that price level

1146
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,920
let me put everything back like it was

1147
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,160
CU I want that level to stay there CU

1148
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,200
this void is significant to me and it's

1149
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,720
also has the added benefit of having an

1150
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,559
old PIR Gap in it

1151
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,640
here so what is it still lacking here

1152
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,640
big big big big paradigm shift for you

1153
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,640
folks before I finish this so buy side

1154
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,240
and balance sell side efficiency here

1155
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,079
and we have it here again what's it

1156
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,040
missing cide delivery we didn't get it

1157
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,079
here because it's a void and only pass

1158
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,599
through one way here so what is it

1159
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,119
missing downside delivery so my

1160
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,920
attention is in this shaded area in this

1161
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,119
fair value Gap I'm aiming for that next

1162
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,359
week for some trade setup I'll be

1163
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:40,319
looking for that okay I'm going to be

1164
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,880
looking for that very thing next week

1165
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,440
unless I'm proven wrong and I'm okay

1166
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,200
with being wrong it's okay doesn't mean

1167
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,760
anything this means I I don't get what I

1168
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,880
want that's okay it's not burgering when

1169
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,400
you're trading just like mentorships you

1170
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,079
can't have it your way all the time

1171
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,359
so inside of here inside these

1172
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,640
Wicks if you

1173
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,040
measure like that you see you have 14

1174
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,000
770 and 3/4 so you have that right there

1175
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,640
and then you have this order block

1176
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,000
forming with that down movement right

1177
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,359
there as it's happening I'm also looking

1178
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:24,280
at this

1179
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Wick

1180
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,880
[Music]

1181
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,599
right

1182
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,480
here 83 and 3/4 so in my mind as long as

1183
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,040
I'm buying below that price of that Wick

1184
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,280
why this one because it's slightly

1185
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,040
higher than that one but there's two of

1186
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,920
them so I want to get a range between

1187
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,559
both the consequent encouragement of

1188
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,359
both of them and that in itself is a PD

1189
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:54,240
array

1190
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,880
too

1191
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,640
oh no it's going to end up on Amazon in

1192
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,119
a book somewhere else somebody else is

1193
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,440
going to write about it you're going to

1194
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,799
talk about it wrong that's all the

1195
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:03,319
details I'm going to give you

1196
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:06,559
here you love that twist the knife ICT

1197
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,200
twist it oh so slow ever so

1198
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,200
slow I'm being mean I know but you guys

1199
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,839
are trying to be ahead of me and every

1200
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:16,440
time I teach something you want to put

1201
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,440
it out in a book so you can claim you

1202
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,319
had it imprint first technically it's

1203
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,799
not in print first when you do there

1204
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,000
you're you're copying me because I've

1205
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,359
already put it in production

1206
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:28,799
here okay I've already I'm already had

1207
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:31,760
all you but anyway a lot of these things

1208
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,319
that I'm talking about here will be

1209
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:36,079
Amplified in book format but you have to

1210
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,680
see examples of it and that's what I'm

1211
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,839
showing you here so the entry here was

1212
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,720
14,775

1213
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,520
even which is between both of those two

1214
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,720
consequent encroachments of those Wicks

1215
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,280
right in here the damage is done down

1216
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,760
here and as long as I'm buying inside

1217
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,599
this order block as it's forming what's

1218
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,119
the high of that candle 91 A2 what's the

1219
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,799
low 63 even what's my fill 75 even it's

1220
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:09,319
less than the 83 of that Wick

1221
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:12,880
here and above the consequent correction

1222
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
of that

1223
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,040
Wick this is too complicated okay it's

1224
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,839
not for you listen not everybody needs

1225
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:23,680
to be a PhD rocket scientist using

1226
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,720
technical science I understand that

1227
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,599
okay it's going to for some of you this

1228
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,119
is going to be above your pay grade

1229
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,839
that's okay but you won't get the level

1230
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,400
of entries that I have in my repertoire

1231
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,839
if you choose not to do it you don't

1232
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,400
need them you don't need all this stuff

1233
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,880
okay I am sick with it okay it's it's

1234
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,839
it's an illness because I need to know

1235
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,079
everything everyone else doesn't know I

1236
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,880
need to know every little intricate

1237
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,000
piece of what makes these markets move

1238
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,720
around and where I've placed my

1239
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,119
fingerprint I'm telling you this is

1240
00:54:58,119 --> 00:54:59,680
what's codified and you're hearing the

1241
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,839
man that did it so the run up into that

1242
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,640
opening range Gap

1243
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,799
high that price is

1244
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:11,440
14,857 and

1245
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,280
34s I want to get out as it's going

1246
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,079
there and because I'm not going to be

1247
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,280
there awake and conscious I want to make

1248
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,599
sure it's very very likely that it's

1249
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,559
going to fill me so the liit order is

1250
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,280
just below where I think it's going to

1251
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,920
reach to because what could have

1252
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,200
happened was it could have went right up

1253
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,119
to that previous settlement price here

1254
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:37,280
and just hit it with the spread not

1255
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,799
offering my

1256
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,280
exit I showed you this year with a live

1257
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,440
account where I had a limit

1258
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,039
order and it didn't fill me I had a

1259
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,359
large portion of the trade already

1260
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,160
booked in profit and the stop was rolled

1261
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,240
into a position when it turned back

1262
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,000
against me it stopped me in

1263
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,599
profit

1264
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,599
but it did not let me out at the Target

1265
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,440
I wanted because of the spread which was

1266
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
one

1267
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,079
tick so because I was tired I was

1268
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:04,960
fatigued I wanted to sleep the limit

1269
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,000
order on this trade was placed

1270
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,559
significantly lower than and you might

1271
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:12,000
not think that's significant you seeing

1272
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,839
it at 57 and a

1273
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,280
quarter here and I'm trying to get out

1274
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,160
at 56 and a quarter so it's to me you

1275
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,079
know it's one and have handles that's

1276
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,920
that's fair you know I'm okay with that

1277
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,160
I don't have to have the exact opening

1278
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,839
range Gap high price I don't need that

1279
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,520
or higher now looking at it it would

1280
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,359
have been nice to wake up and still have

1281
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:36,400
it you know without that limit order

1282
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,440
there and just have my stop loss at a

1283
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,319
level where if if it stopped me out I

1284
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,520
made 500 bucks or 10 you $1,000

1285
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,680
something like

1286
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,119
that it's a reasonable position size it

1287
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,160
wasn't a largest portion of what I'm

1288
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,880
looking for generally um I wasn't trying

1289
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,280
to build any kind of pyramiding because

1290
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,400
you know either I'm going to be right or

1291
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,480
I'm going to be wrong and using the

1292
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,359
logic I've been teaching using the logic

1293
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:03,160
I talked about in that live stream okay

1294
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,359
this is a real execution and you can't

1295
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,480
hide it you can't explain it the way

1296
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,039
because it's really there it's not in

1297
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:11,960
Market

1298
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,119
replay I'll let you see over here there

1299
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,760
was no other

1300
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,860
executions it's just that

1301
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,280
[Music]

1302
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,799
one

1303
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:26,799
see

1304
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:32,000
so this weekend I want you to rest I

1305
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,480
want you to keep your eye on what's

1306
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,839
going on over in the Middle East because

1307
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,599
that will have shock waves that go

1308
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,799
around the world and the markets will

1309
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,200
show you that in price next week in

1310
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,039
addition to what we already have as news

1311
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:45,280
drivers and volatility injections with

1312
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,119
all the red folder events that's part of

1313
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:50,880
and leased through next week's trading

1314
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,319
so until I talk to you next time be safe
