if we get above the -OB[daily] and start to expand or accelerate in terms of speed 
then it might be much more deeper retracement required 
and in that case we may have to revisit the Swing High

what makes you confident that we probably made 
an important low for the rest of the year and it goes higher from where we are now ?

it needs to take out this high and then once it goes above this inefficiency
then and only then would I'd qualify that as a low of any real significance.

I try to teach the avoidance of trying to pick tops and bottoms 
because it's a skill set that you're not going to be consistent with.

no one's going to be that consistent with it.
it's not important that you try to get that type of Turning Point.

you want to trade in a direction of order flow which removes a lot of the concern for being perfect all right.
