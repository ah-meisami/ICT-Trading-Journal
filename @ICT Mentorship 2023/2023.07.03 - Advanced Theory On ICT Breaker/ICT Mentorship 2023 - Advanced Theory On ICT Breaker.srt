1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,639
thank you

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,199
notebooks

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,900
welcome back this is going to be a

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,560
Brief Review and then a short little

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,500
tutorial or amplification if you will

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,260
of my ICT breaker

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,059
so right away we're looking at the

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,180
dollar Index is a weekly chart

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,920
let's see the

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,719
inefficiency here between those candles

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,660
hello and this candle is high we worked

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,520
up inside of that

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
and had pretty much an indecisive candle

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,480
so it was kind of a

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,239
lackluster trading session for dollar

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,219
last week

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,620
this range in here I'd like to see it

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,680
prove to me that it wants to go higher

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,619
or lower and to go higher it needs to

20
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,500
get above the rejection block

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,140
here so the close of this candle

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,000
if it trades above that then I believe

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,220
will resume going higher

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,500
if we take out this low then I'm going

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,619
to look for liquidity below here because

26
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,080
we're in the middle of the range

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,020
the range being the low the high it's

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,900
indecisive it's not one-sided it's not

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,659
easy to see which side the marketplace

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,119
is going to reach for so when it's like

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,820
this we sit still we try not to force

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,060
our will or impose a a bias that's not

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,280
necessarily

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,460
predetermined yet

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,500
all right so here is daily chart

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,840
you can see again this is at weekly fair

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,420
value Gap the bodies were just outside

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,460
of that range and there's another reason

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,399
why I'm elected to

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,740
sit still not really have a hard bias

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,140
going into the new week here it's also

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,720
fourth July in the United States

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,659
the volume may be affected by that

44
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,239
greatly so I believe the latter part of

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,979
this week will be the real cleanest

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,480
price action

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
so we'll be looking for Price action

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,440
post Wednesday

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
daily fair value get down here you can

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
see it reached into that we mentioned

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,860
that as a downside draw

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,959
previously in previous commentary

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,020
and then we lose from this liquidity

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,540
below this low and inefficiency remember

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,920
price only goes down from one of those

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
two reasons and it rallies back up into

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,980
the short-term premium relative to

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,180
High

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,420
and the low midpoint in here

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,800
the beneficiency on the weekly chart

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,959
being transposed to the Daily you can

62
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,580
see that's where we drew into now that's

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,940
going to provide the backdrop for shorts

64
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,340
in year a dollar and pound dollar

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,760
here's euro dollar on

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,860
the weekly chart

67
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,720
weekly inefficiency

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,400
okay basically the opposite of what we

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,120
saw

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,519
one dollar Index as you would expect the

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,620
CE of this Wick

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,700
here

73
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,459
we treat Wicks as a gap this like the

74
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,379
algorithm no so the market saw the

75
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,760
weekly High form right at the previous

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,099
week's CE of its

77
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,000
premium

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,840
right here

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,580
and again indecisive

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,580
weekly range by trading down into a

81
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,659
discount

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,220
by seven balance cell sign efficiency

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,959
which is framed by the

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,060
eye of this candle and the lower that

85
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,860
candle so we traded down into it and

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,519
then back into

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
the weekly range

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,819
those weekly ranges apply to the daily

89
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,060
chart you can see how we traded up into

90
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,459
Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday high

91
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,540
of the week

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
where did it form the hide the week in

93
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,980
the previous week's CE on this weekly candle don't

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
take my word for it

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
go into it and you'll see it right here

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,319
all right let's drop down into

98
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,080
an hourly chart on Euro all right so you

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,580
can see how we worked

100
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,280
lower here here is that run onto the

101
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,579
previous weeks CE

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,760
oh it's wick on the weekly chart

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,340
creating the high on Tuesday if we're

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
bearish

105
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,300
we have a senate 70 likelihood of

106
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,500
creating

107
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,820
the high

108
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,160
on Tuesday

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,900
and we see it trading up into that CE

111
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,280
breaks down finds some support at the

112
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,020
old

113
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,180
fairy GAP orange and the higher time

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,639
frame try to rally and give up the ghost

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
broke lower

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
so we have

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,139
breaker in here down there it looks

118
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,639
rather sloppy and I'll be teaching a

119
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,540
little bit more about

120
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,520
Breakers in the united portion of this

121
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,620
lecture

122
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,740
so all of this run here

123
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,560
extend that over

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,540
you can see we're hitting that perfectly

125
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,120
there and it just so happens to be near

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
the upper end of that Odin efficiency so

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,139
we're blending a lot of things

128
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,840
in terms of inefficiency and buy side

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,460
liquidity eyesight would be resting

130
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,560
above this short term High here so we

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
round above

132
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,020
back into

133
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
a premium array which is a breaker

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,539
trades up into it and aggressively sells

135
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,699
off attacking the sell side below this

136
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,340
low and down into that low here and into

137
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,740
that discount pair that you got then

138
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
once we got into it we returned quickly

139
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600
back up into the premium

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,060
if everybody got the Shaded in Orange I

141
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,080
promise you if you take the information

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,699
I showed you on the higher time frame on

143
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,620
your own chart it'll drop down to these

144
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,060
lower time frame charts like this you'll

145
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,820
see Euros was beautifully handled with

146
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,800
the elements I'm teaching in terms of

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,500
short-term premium High short term

148
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,840
discount low inefficiency of both

149
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
Marketplace inefficiency below the

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,300
marketplace

151
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,539
and day of the week

152
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,100
and then the opposite end of the range

153
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,400
forming here on Friday

154
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,340
[Music]

155
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,740
11 15 minute timer brain

156
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,800
you can see that we have

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,380
a very nice drop here

158
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,240
and the rally up now all of this back

159
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,580
and forth in here that's not a concern

160
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,720
for me

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,460
you might be looking at this saying okay

162
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,740
well isn't this a breaker from high to

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,919
low to higher high no

164
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,840
the range from this high down to that

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,460
low up that high

166
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,860
all of this price action from the high

167
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,900
to the low to the high right there I'm

168
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,319
ignoring all of this this is time

169
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,539
distortion you have to look at the time

170
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,819
of day when the highs are forming the

171
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,460
algorithm refers to time first not just

172
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,259
simply because there's a price run so

173
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,680
we're looking at high low higher high

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,020
this movement down here

175
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,199
that's where the Secret Sauce is if you

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
will

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
I'll get to that later on

178
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,060
but that down closed candle right there

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,720
that is the sweet spot right in here if

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,819
you extend that forward

181
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,199
that's where it's hitting that now we're

182
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,340
cutting through candles because we are

183
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,020
not supplying demand it's the fallacy

184
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,479
the market trades up into a cranium

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,599
relative to the range from high to low

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,699
and we're also reaching into the upper

187
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,020
portion of the Shaded Orange

188
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,479
inefficiency

189
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,500
breaker cut through candles bang hit it

190
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,240
what time of day New York open

191
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,580
aggressively runs for the sell side here

192
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,160
and the sell side liquidity

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
in the higher time frame and into that

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,539
discount care value

195
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,240
once it enters that then the algorithm

196
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,460
pulls right back up into the middle of

197
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,280
the range range being

198
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,979
the high and low of the week

199
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,780
and now we're in consolidation inside of

200
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,979
that premium for Vega

201
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,000
all right moving right along this is the

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,039
e-mini s p weekly chart

203
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,500
and I mentioned that we try to reach up

204
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,759
into

205
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,039
this weekly volume balance and we just

206
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,479
fell short of it it looks like it

207
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,520
touched it here but I promise you it

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,900
didn't get there it got real close to it

209
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,759
though but it's been acting as a drawing

210
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,160
liquidity as you remember

211
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,940
the NASDAQ reached up into its volume

212
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,280
balances on its weekly chart but we were

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,060
waiting for the sixth sister effect on s

214
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,039
p to draw this

215
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,259
specific index higher and we have seen

216
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,200
it deliver like gangbusters so bias

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,779
starts on a weekly chart we have to know

218
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,760
where it's likely to reach for and then

219
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,159
what we're doing is trying to predict

220
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,860
yes unfortunately we do try to predict

221
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,480
we don't react to price we need to

222
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
predict the likely expansion in the

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,040
weekly chart I'm not trying to pick the

224
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,839
closing price I have totals for that I'm

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,160
not trying to

226
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
demand that it closes on the high or the

227
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,519
low we don't need that

228
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,080
but we want to know where it's likely to

229
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,940
expand higher or lower

230
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,740
if you look real close there was a small

231
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,839
little inefficiency right there

232
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,680
between the previous weeks low

233
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,600
and this week's High

234
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,399
so that little inefficiency right there

235
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,560
it's more opened traded down into that

236
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,380
and it Rockets up taking out the

237
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,940
short-term high but drawing into this

238
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,019
area here

239
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,519
okay so I suspect that's still probably

240
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,899
a factor for this week

241
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,420
on the daily chart you can see we have

242
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,800
this inefficiency here and this

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,540
inefficiency here now I sent the Tweet

244
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,399
out now a week and a half ago stating

245
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,600
that these were the two reference points

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
I liked that initially at the time of

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
the tweet I said I favored the low end

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
we went down into it the top of the

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,580
market was not called by me I don't try

250
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,980
to do that when we're in primary buy

251
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,180
models

252
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,720
so we're looking for lungs

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,180
reaching for Discount and then expanding

254
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,680
into inefficiencies of the ball

255
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,660
Marketplace or by solid liquidity the

256
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,920
buy side would be resting right above

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,720
here and inefficiency would be the

258
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,339
weekly volume unbalance both being above

259
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,200
market price at the beginning of the

260
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,540
week and price Drew up higher throughout

261
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,339
the week so each individual day if you

262
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,740
would have been focusing only on longs

263
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,880
that's what you're doing you're

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,860
filtering out in the best case scenario

265
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,660
where the higher time frame weekly chart

266
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,779
is suggesting price may go ultimately

267
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,000
we stay with that bias each day every

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,620
session we go in looking for a reason to

269
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,880
be long when there's a buy program

270
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,019
underway and that's what we're seeing

271
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:22,260
here

272
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,060
[Music]

273
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,680
zooming in on the daily chart I want you

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
to see how we were beautifully delivered

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,180
into this candles hi you see that

276
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,940
trading right there and perfect delivery

277
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,360
rallies up and then we have this area

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,700
here which is a premium when it was down

279
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,019
here it was a premium for your value got

280
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,140
but if we're expecting to go higher

281
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,700
my anticipation is we're going to take

282
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,040
out this high and gravitate towards that

283
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,380
Weekly volume imbalance so the buy

284
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,380
program would send us into discovery of

285
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,560
buy side and premium volume and balance

286
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,000
you would grade this range with 25 50

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
and 75 percent respective levels or

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
gradients and you would treat each one

289
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,800
of them as a Target

290
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,720
well we only got As far as the buy side

291
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,760
here and just fell short of touching the

292
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,380
low end of that Weekly volume of valence

293
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,200
but this right here as we're climbing

294
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
back up into this range if you're

295
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
familiar with my market maker buy and

296
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
sell model I know that is not wake off

297
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,660
this area here that inefficiency

298
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,760
which will be reach for if we're bullish

299
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,680
we're expecting to expand through that

300
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,779
that will become my inversion pair value

301
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,740
cap find that in your Wyckoff textbooks

302
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,000
so there's our levels we're going to

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,220
show in two sets of

304
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,899
small little trend lines and we'll drop

305
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,800
down the lower time frame

306
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,760
right so we have the market trading down

307
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,640
into the lower fair value you got and

308
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,980
then we have an expansion higher and in

309
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,279
all of this range right there at range

310
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,220
is the last up close candle within the

311
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,160
low high lower low which trades into

312
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,500
what the inefficiency these two red

313
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
lines here

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,160
that's the lower discount for your value

315
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,660
you got the one I was telling you a week

316
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,040
and a half ago almost two weeks ago but

317
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,779
I favored the lower one and the market

318
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,600
did drop down into it then we have a

319
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,459
displacement to the upside

320
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,620
taking out short-term high if you're

321
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,300
aggressive you can use that high which

322
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,760
one do you do you use ICT whichever one

323
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm trusting at the time

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,779
so if you want to be a conservative

325
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,420
Trader demanding a lot more behind the

326
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,100
trades then you would use this one here

327
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,140
so why that one because it's the hot

328
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,420
it's the high between this low

329
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,519
and this low which is a bullish breaker

330
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
so you could expand that to the right

331
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,500
and as price rallies about

332
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,360
comes down to find some support multiple

333
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,620
times here

334
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,220
then rallies up consolidates takes out

335
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,040
sell side there wants a stop run occurs

336
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,200
the market should expand higher it does

337
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,240
rip through that

338
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,279
premium fair value Gap that we would

339
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,260
expect to see it trade to and look at

340
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,880
that look at the bodies respecting the

341
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,100
high end of that inversion favorite you

342
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,220
have it does not need to trade down into

343
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,899
it it can

344
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,519
but these are instances where sometimes

345
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,899
when you'll see medium executions I'm

346
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,300
recording it I'll say it's better for

347
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,519
these inefficiencies or that particular

348
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,760
fair value Gap to remain unfilled

349
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,100
we want to see this be treated

350
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,579
as a measuring Gap or a breakaway Gap so

351
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,000
it's only necessary for me or you to see

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,860
this area right in here Provide support

353
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,360
we're seeing that in the body's clothes

354
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,820
and the body's opening and then for

355
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,180
traction

356
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,100
the inefficiency here doesn't look

357
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,959
inefficient on the lower time frame

358
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,300
hourly chart that it was based on what

359
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,760
the daily chart so you have to transpose

360
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,959
those levels under your lower time

361
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,279
frames otherwise you'll lose all the

362
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,620
plot narrative and storyline behind why

363
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,019
price should be reacting or drawing to

364
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,480
specific levels so that right there

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,740
would have been an area where I would

366
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,800
add if I was trading in many s p and

367
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
looking for a reason to go long and add

368
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,899
more say for instance say you bought uh

369
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,519
the breaker down here

370
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,980
and you wanted to see it rip through

371
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,260
this fair value cap anyone that simply

372
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,959
looks at gaps and price charts now you

373
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,060
may think that every inefficiency is a

374
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,380
buy or sell they lose the idea of

375
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,240
knowing where price is ultimately trying

376
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,620
to reach for which is the number one

377
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,500
rule I teach as my students coming in I

378
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,980
that press that very hard as your main

379
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,660
focus because it's going to be the one

380
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,279
that you're going to utilize for the

381
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,260
rest of your career that gives you all

382
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,839
the comfort and confidence to know what

383
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:37,860
you're doing and how you're operating

384
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,560
being foolish or bearish bias comes by

385
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
understanding where the higher time

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,740
frame weekly draw on liquidity is

387
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,820
you can't watch a video and there's

388
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,139
nobody else out there going to show you

389
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,320
a real shortcut always a winner approach

390
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,600
it takes time understanding price action

391
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,220
what is it reaching for

392
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
and

393
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,339
this is enough

394
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,860
to Warrant an expansion higher and until

395
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,500
we find it

396
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,660
providing support remember it's this red

397
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,180
line here is the high of that fair value

398
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,320
Gap

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,880
let me go back up into the daily chart

400
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,019
I'm going to show you this little area

401
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,820
right here

402
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,440
are these two candles right there are

403
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,639
occurring

404
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,260
and finding support at the high end it's

405
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,560
this

406
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,820
it's that level right there which is the

407
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,040
high of that fair value Gap

408
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,899
and we're expecting price to go higher

409
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,100
so we're not looking for it to go up

410
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,260
here to go down that's not the that's

411
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,220
not the

412
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,820
2022 model okay we're using this as a

413
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,779
stepping

414
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,300
stone or a wrong on the ladder to

415
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,459
provide us a reason to see more

416
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,060
injection of higher prices

417
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,339
so we see that occurring right there

418
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,860
so that's a a really good signature even

419
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,139
if I didn't take a partial

420
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,540
entry and scaling in with you know like

421
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,260
a pyramiding position

422
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,000
by seeing that that comforts me

423
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,940
in terms of being on side so I can

424
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,380
anticipate the market reaching up into

425
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,720
that buy solid quarter day over there

426
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
and it reaches up into it and look at

427
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,399
the bodies respecting what that old High

428
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,620
yes we Wick through it yes we fall just

429
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,060
short of the weekly volume and Bounds

430
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,459
but we're not trying to demanded to get

431
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,139
there we offer ourselves up the

432
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,519
opportunity for our best case scenario

433
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,139
should it trade there

434
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,060
but we're open to the idea that it may

435
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,740
need to do that the following week

436
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,120
because it's doing this on a Friday

437
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,920
all right s p

438
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,440
15 minute Candlestick you can see a

439
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,300
really good

440
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,160
illustration of that run into that

441
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,740
inversion fair value Gap hits it and

442
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,920
rallies inefficiency trades down into it

443
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,000
here

444
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,139
at the open rips higher consolidates

445
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,320
trades higher once more digs into

446
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,779
showed you execution on Twitter and the

447
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,300
link will be obviously shared in the

448
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,519
comment section which I'll only be the

449
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
one commenting and yes I see your

450
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
comments when you leave them but it's

451
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,099
it's personal for me and I'm not trying

452
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,559
to broadcast your adoration for me

453
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,220
it's I don't need to share that but I

454
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,619
enjoy reading them

455
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,720
it rips into that buy side there

456
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,099
and then comes all the way back down

457
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,740
into the inefficiency here with this

458
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,740
cluster of order flow right there

459
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,120
that's where we settle on the day

460
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,020
so on the 15 minute time frame if you

461
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,480
look at this we have obviously been

462
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
looking for higher prices on NASDAQ and

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
on ES and I'm focusing primarily yes

464
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,419
because I've been teaching conceptually

465
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,760
the sixth sister Concepts that I have

466
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,039
and we've already seen the upside

467
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,500
leadership by NASDAQ so we have been

468
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,179
focusing on ES

469
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,240
to show how that

470
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,539
particular index has been drawn higher

471
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,000
in sympathy trying to catch up to what

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,220
was delivered with the Run higher in

473
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,780
NASDAQ

474
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,940
so because we're published we want to

475
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,140
look for periods where there is

476
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,880
accumulation

477
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,980
accumulation of logs so we can see what

478
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,120
we have a low and a lower low in es

479
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,520
on NASDAQ we're seeing a Divergence

480
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,140
there NASDAQ say no I'm not willing to

481
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,299
make that lower low like we did in s p

482
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,419
respectively so this is smt Divergence

483
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,660
and we would expect price to go higher

484
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,360
if we were looking for the market to

485
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,240
trade with

486
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,340
the leadership issue

487
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,960
okay in other words say the NASDAQ

488
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,780
hadn't already established its dominance

489
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,280
higher

490
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
but it has been for weeks

491
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,539
and if this Divergence here then I would

492
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,480
have been trading NASDAQ but because

493
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,340
NASDAQ has already done a lot of upside

494
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,220
and I'm trading the six sister approach

495
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,080
the fact that we have this Divergence

496
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,960
down here which is a lower low but not

497
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,460
lower low in NASDAQ you're probably

498
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,080
wondering why wouldn't you trade in

499
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,940
NASDAQ you're not incorrect by doing

500
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,260
that

501
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,080
but I'm teaching you by using the sixth

502
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,660
sister approach that by sympathy this is

503
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,600
going to try to trade higher and a

504
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,080
little bit more

505
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,080
I don't want to say stronger but more

506
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,780
reliable because NASDAQ has already done

507
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,460
its upside delivery

508
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,660
so

509
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,179
the s p is basically going to have its

510
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,559
Better Days Ahead which is what we saw

511
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,200
last week well knob side so I would view

512
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,179
this low being taken out there as a stop

513
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,700
run and that's how you trust a turtle

514
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,440
soup entry okay buying sell stops and

515
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,539
this would be simply just buying the

516
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,640
stronger leadership issue at the time

517
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,960
and you wouldn't be incorrect by doing

518
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,220
it because you can see it does in fact

519
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,260
rally but look at the delivery of price

520
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,700
in comparison between the two

521
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,100
a lot more willingness to show it wants

522
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,080
to go higher because look we rallied

523
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
higher and then come back down and

524
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,740
touched the high end of that fair value

525
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,539
gap which is this red level here and now

526
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,539
we also have that breaker

527
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,220
extending It Forward inside of that

528
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,900
range

529
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,179
we can meet buying has a lot of support

530
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,320
of

531
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,500
discount behind this entry area here and

532
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,820
at the same time look what's occurring

533
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,700
in NASDAQ it's really muddy meaning that

534
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,780
it's not so sure footing

535
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,820
compared to that one where we have a

536
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,039
higher low here we don't see the higher

537
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,020
low here it's a slopping consolidation

538
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,059
so here rips higher comes back and

539
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,520
really wants to go Higher One More Time

540
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,260
touch to the inversion for your value

541
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,419
Gap and it's the low of the bullish

542
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,000
breaker and it rips higher and

543
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
consolidates the rest of the day and

544
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,660
then we have another confirmation that

545
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,940
we're looking for a higher delivery in

546
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,960
price

547
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,900
low lower low so this is a stop run

548
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,080
below those lows here so that's a run-on

549
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,120
sell side liquidity and it touches the

550
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
breaker bullish breaker

551
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,260
the same time NASDAQ is unwilling to

552
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,020
make a lower low that's smt it's telling

553
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,520
you that there's accumulation there's a

554
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,740
cracking correlation and this will never

555
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,080
stop working the markets will always

556
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,360
have these types of inefficiencies when

557
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,059
prices are running out highs and lows

558
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,919
respectively if you have a bias if you

559
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,120
know you're looking for higher prices

560
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,039
and you see these confirmations that's

561
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,860
what this is this is not a timing tool

562
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,320
it's not a selection tool it's a

563
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,940
confirmation

564
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,580
okay because we're using smt as a

565
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,720
qualifier

566
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,940
to indicate that we are in fact on one

567
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,980
side by trying to be bullish

568
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,860
and we can use this idea to

569
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,720
if you're a turtle soup type Trader if

570
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,620
you're

571
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,960
trying to train yourself to buy sell

572
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,720
stocks or sell buy stops

573
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,659
that means you're doing a run against

574
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,580
the existing

575
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,440
pending orders above the marketplace or

576
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,299
below the marketplace without this

577
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,559
Insight without understanding of where

578
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,539
the Market's going to go to

579
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,520
you're going to find it trading a turtle

580
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,980
soup pattern or a false Breakout

581
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,080
and Trigger it in the opposite direction

582
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
it's going to be very difficult for you

583
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,500
to do that and it's scary but this is

584
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,760
how you learn how to do it and you have

585
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,980
to do months of this type of analysis

586
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,840
then you can go in there and just buy

587
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,419
sell stops and sell buy stops and you've

588
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,919
seen me do executions of that recording

589
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,179
it

590
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,580
the primary function of smt behind this

591
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,440
is supporting the idea that we are in a

592
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,120
buy program and it's okay to keep

593
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,760
focusing on Longs or yes

594
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,260
so the market goes higher again another

595
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,480
area here

596
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,220
higher low

597
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,020
or low

598
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,380
so what is this this is reaching for the

599
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,120
relative equal lows for the sell side so

600
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,159
this is a run on sell side liquidity so

601
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,460
a Trader using NASDAQ they could use

602
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,600
that as a long entry

603
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,039
same here

604
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,380
buying sell side but we're seeing what

605
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,940
relative strength now show up in yes

606
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,380
higher low

607
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,900
or low

608
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,940
it's the time of the week where the

609
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,760
market wants to reach for it's

610
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,539
finale it's reaching high up into the

611
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,360
June 16 2023 High which is this level

612
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,580
right here and gravitating towards that

613
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,780
Weekly volume of balance which is that

614
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,299
blue shade of air here it's not shown

615
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,740
the entire range because I want to have

616
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,080
all the details being shown here but

617
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
again look how it's treating the top end

618
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
of that inversion figure value on the

619
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,940
daily chart

620
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,179
hits it and then rips higher reaching

621
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,880
into that buys a liquidity above June 16

622
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,940
2023 is high and then

623
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,220
the added benefit of knowing that that

624
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,840
Weekly volume and balance shaded in blue

625
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,480
that's a large magnet for the algorithm

626
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,620
that we're going to reach up into that

627
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,600
because inefficiency

628
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,580
so when we're down here

629
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,320
down here

630
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,059
in here

631
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,679
over here

632
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,200
in here they're all points of reference

633
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,679
for you to either be long add to

634
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,240
existing positions if you're short-term

635
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,179
or a swing Trader or just confirming

636
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,919
that your own side for bias and then you

637
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,140
can look for lower time frame order flow

638
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,840
like for a silver bullet in the 10 clock

639
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,419
to 11 o'clock morning hour or 2 pm to 3

640
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,120
P.M afternoon Silver Bullet so there's a

641
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,919
lot of things you can do to work with

642
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,140
this information but I leave it to you

643
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,880
to determine how you're going to use it

644
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,679
for your particular model and you can

645
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,480
use the multiplier of your choice it

646
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,460
could be a optical trade entry it could

647
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,679
be a bull shorter block that you're

648
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,419
trading on you could be buying sell side

649
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,820
liquidity you can be doing inversion

650
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,620
fair value gaps Vector fair value gaps

651
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,480
institutional River flow entry drills

652
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,120
the the list is endless in terms of what

653
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,159
it is that you want to trade and

654
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,780
whatever that multiplier is which is a

655
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,880
PV array that I've taught that's your

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,220
entry model but this is the framework to

657
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,960
determine where the Market's going to go

658
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,580
and when it's going to be confirming to

659
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,020
you that it wants to go higher all right

660
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,159
I'm going to take all this other extra

661
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,260
stuff off here so you can see

662
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,000
the divergences lower higher

663
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
lower

664
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,200
higher

665
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,820
higher

666
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,760
lower all indicating that it wants to go

667
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,340
higher now many times my students when

668
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,559
they first seen it destruction or

669
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,679
lecture video about smt they think that

670
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,299
they need to go into the charts and look

671
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,980
for the discrepancy or difference

672
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,919
between lower low and then there's no

673
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,080
lower low here okay that means they can

674
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,260
go long that's not how you use smt it is

675
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,840
a qualifier okay it just gives you

676
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,460
confirmation that

677
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,159
order flow is probably

678
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,980
not in the direction that you see the

679
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,779
lower low being made

680
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,360
when a higher low is being formed in a

681
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,860
market that you're anticipating to be

682
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,840
bullish anyway so we were looking for

683
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,360
this area up here for weeks we've been

684
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,520
calling this month actually a draw up

685
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,320
here for ES

686
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,159
so we've been bullish on ES for months

687
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,779
and finally we just fell short of it

688
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,880
here and I'm I'm not convinced that we

689
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,980
had the high form here so we're likely

690
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,419
to see it draw up into that going into

691
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,559
this week's Trading

692
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
all right so here is the five minute

693
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,440
chart on ES and I'm showing it in

694
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,820
regular trading hours

695
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,919
so that way we're showing that Gap right

696
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,480
here so this is where we settled on

697
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,460
Thursday and we opened up at 9 30 on

698
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,340
Fridays trading regular trading hours

699
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,100
so if you add the details in here I sent

700
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,419
a tweet out on June 30th 2023 at 9 52

701
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,179
a.m this is always a New York local time

702
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,520
and right there is the candle I made

703
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,440
that post on Twitter

704
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,679
I said that this high

705
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,120
44.93 and three quarters

706
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,539
that high right there is the daily June

707
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,419
16 2023 High I said that that buy side

708
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,880
is Juicy meaning that it's going to want

709
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,520
to gravitate towards that so how would

710
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,620
you use that information well you can

711
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,900
use it with

712
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,260
Fairway gaps bull shorter blocks buying

713
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,659
sell side liquidity below this lowest

714
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,400
one sell side so you could be a buyer

715
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,100
down there oh wait a minute ICT didn't

716
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,260
you say that these opening range gaps

717
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,860
they can draw price down in yes

718
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,539
but there's also

719
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,340
Tendencies for the market to have these

720
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,620
large range gaps because it's in a hurry

721
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,120
to get somewhere we're in a hurry get to

722
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,039
that Weekly volume and balance in shaded

723
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,380
blue and the bias on the court that told

724
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,279
you

725
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,900
right here

726
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,140
so we drop down ahead of lunch in your

727
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,400
lunch hour we took out sell side there

728
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,380
rallied created a fair value cap that's

729
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,760
what I'm showing you here

730
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,240
right there okay Market drops down into

731
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,020
that

732
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,600
perfectly and then rallies away and

733
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,179
attacks what this area of relative equal

734
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,100
high so this is their first initial by

735
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,559
solid liquidity then the larger pool of

736
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,020
liquidity is here on the daily chart

737
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,679
well in June 16 2023 that daily High you

738
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,480
see we gravitated towards there we

739
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,919
worked around that level and finally

740
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,140
punched up and just fell short by

741
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,520
reaching into that Weekly volume

742
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,900
imbalance and then finding the last

743
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,340
portion of the day

744
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,799
the market rips back into the range and

745
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,179
trades into this inefficiency between

746
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,640
these two primary candles which is a 10

747
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,539
minute Fair Vega

748
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,539
zooming in here on a five minute chart

749
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,760
again here's where I said that we would

750
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,299
be looking for a draw to 44 93.75 buy

751
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,840
side this level right here is that high

752
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,059
on the daily chart

753
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,279
the market gravitates from this point

754
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,200
here

755
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,059
all the way up into that level there so

756
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,279
you do not look for shorts here you

757
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,100
don't lose your mind and become fearful

758
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,500
because we have a huge opening range gap

759
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,460
on Friday with unfinished business that

760
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,820
June 16th has buy side it wanted it

761
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,820
I indicated that here no other time

762
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,919
frame on Friday that I point to a lower

763
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,159
Target I did not say another level that

764
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,559
failed to hit okay we talked about this

765
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,020
as a draw on liquidity the weekly volume

766
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,940
balance but I gave a very specific level

767
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,679
for targeting

768
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,960
so when we look for

769
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,640
the

770
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,740
directional bias

771
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,500
to come into effect we're looking for

772
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,539
higher prices we did get a stop run on

773
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,000
sell side there and then we've seen

774
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,740
price go higher and inefficiency it

775
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,240
comes back down into it now we're in

776
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,520
lunch so where's the buy side

777
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,960
above here

778
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,299
so above those relative equal highs

779
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,980
that's what this is right there we're

780
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,559
down in a one minute chart now so 44.87

781
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,960
and a half that's buy side here is that

782
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,440
five minute

783
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,240
pure Bay Gap

784
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,919
I will be teaching and talking about

785
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,440
this coming week

786
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,000
the 11 50 to 12 10 macro it's a time of

787
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,460
day where the algorithm will begin a

788
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,380
price run it runs for liquidity

789
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,299
South Side is here it drops down right

790
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,919
there and then goes higher let me take

791
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,120
it back up to the five minutes that way

792
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,020
you know where you're at and get your

793
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,039
bearings

794
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,440
we're looking at this run here and drop

795
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,899
down between these two blue lines

796
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,159
targeting that initially but ultimately

797
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,059
above

798
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,299
the June 16 2023 so that those levels

799
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,100
here we're going to look at all this

800
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,440
price action and this run up here right

801
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,539
now it's on a five minute chart looking

802
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,580
at it now on a one minute chart it looks

803
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,720
like this here's the relative equal

804
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,919
highs

805
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,659
the drop down below the lowest sell sign

806
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,659
is and then at 11 50 the 12 10 the

807
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,899
algorithm will begin its buy model it

808
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,299
will run higher trades into the

809
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,559
inefficient it doesn't look like an

810
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,120
inefficiency here on a one minute chart

811
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,919
does it which is the reason why you have

812
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,140
to cycle through time frames

813
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,740
you have to be able to go through a five

814
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,899
four three two one minute chart when

815
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,640
you're day trading because you'll see

816
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,899
the inefficiency that the market will

817
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,100
reprice to

818
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,919
and then once it does that perfectly and

819
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,840
it's the time of day when we'd expect

820
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,120
what the lunch run on liquidity that's

821
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,640
here and we're blending not only is the

822
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
lunch hour

823
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,120
macro reaching up for the buy side but

824
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,460
it's also this would be a run in the

825
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,500
same direction of our higher time frame

826
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,899
bias reaching for

827
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:10,080
the June 16th High because in normal

828
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,779
instances like say little bearish we

829
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,399
would see the market rip up into here

830
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,140
take out the buy side and then work

831
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,940
lower because we're embarrassed cell

832
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,919
program on the higher time frame charts

833
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,080
we're not in a bearish Cell program

834
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,059
we're in a higher time frame bullish buy

835
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,399
program meaning that that shaded Blue

836
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,600
Area up here that Weekly volume

837
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,360
imbalance and the old high on June 16

838
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,940
2023 about that high is going to be buy

839
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,480
side someone went short large funds have

840
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,760
liquidity above there what kind buy side

841
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,980
buy stops they're protecting they were

842
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,919
holding shorts the algorithm runs

843
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,539
against that it's not running against

844
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,620
you

845
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,720
okay it's not looking for your order

846
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,580
it's going for where the large fund

847
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,919
liquidity is or it's running for a

848
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,960
higher time frame inefficiency which is

849
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220
also

850
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,340
conveniently allowing that algorithm to

851
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,140
reprice against

852
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,580
the buy side liquidity resting above

853
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,919
June 16 2023

854
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,679
so this run higher it gets into here and

855
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
then you see there's a first partial

856
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,820
right above relative equal highs I'm

857
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,159
holding you want to catch the big runs

858
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,020
the big rips higher and lower and get

859
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,340
the lines portion of the daily range

860
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,840
that's what I've shown here

861
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,919
first partial here then I took the idea

862
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,059
of

863
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,360
the high here to that high and I did

864
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,659
gradients and you'll see that in the

865
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,020
execution video I want to see it reach

866
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,760
up into those levels and I layered out

867
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,460
the odors and then I had one up in here

868
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,399
and I had one ultimately just below the

869
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,080
weekly volume of mouse to see if it can

870
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,120
reach for it as the best case scenario I

871
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,860
didn't get that again and I'll come back

872
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,260
down and stop me out here on the final

873
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,370
single contract

874
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,020
[Music]

875
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,700
if you look at the

876
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,740
diagram here

877
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,100
this is my bearish breaker

878
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,799
this is not a break and retest okay it's

879
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,940
not an Fu candle it's not a like off it

880
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,000
is a schematic in terms of understanding

881
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,760
how runs on liquidity and then a

882
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,539
repricing lower occurs so what we need

883
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,100
to know is

884
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,080
where is liquidity

885
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,080
and there's two ways to use the breaker

886
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,019
this is a bearish breaker and what we're

887
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,640
understanding with this diagram is

888
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,100
there's obviously when you have a market

889
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,440
that is predisposed to go lower if

890
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,640
you're anticipating the market going

891
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,980
lower if you're looking for a bear

892
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,380
Market to provide a additional entry or

893
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,200
a point of reference for

894
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,360
pyramiding new short positions this is

895
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,240
what you're looking for okay this is one

896
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,000
of the strongest PD arrays I have

897
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,220
because the

898
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,799
characteristic behind this PD array is

899
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,840
that it is acting on pending orders so

900
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,480
if you've ever traded and had your stop

901
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,640
run hit and then see it run in your

902
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,019
favor after your stop loss was hit

903
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,780
that's what this pattern capitalizes on

904
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,580
it really takes you into the marketplace

905
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,139
in terms of a narrative

906
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,000
to attack the ill-informed or retail

907
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
Trader that tries to look for

908
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,260
continuations

909
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,839
some kind of trend following model if

910
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,699
they have no idea where liquidity is and

911
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,139
what narrative is and why that market

912
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,960
should be going lower they get many

913
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,839
times trapped by this move they will be

914
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,300
caught being a buyer of a breakout above

915
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,739
a short-term High

916
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,719
and then it only goes up to a higher

917
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,760
time frame Buy sell liquidity where the

918
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,399
actual reversal occurs

919
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,500
there's two stages of liquidity for the

920
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,899
highest form of precision with my

921
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,699
breaker you'll always have the

922
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,199
short-term by side liquidity of all the

923
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,339
short-term High

924
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,500
but it's going to want to reach into a

925
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,540
higher time frame by solid liquidity and

926
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,820
then you're waiting to see if it runs

927
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,839
away from that

928
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,880
and then inside of this price Lake from

929
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,880
A to B that right there is what you're

930
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,300
looking for for targeting

931
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,980
now I haven't taught this before this is

932
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,300
the first time even my charter members

933
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,460
and my private mentorship which nobody

934
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,839
can join anymore and I don't even make

935
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,400
videos for them anymore okay the only

936
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,260
thing they get to do is ask me questions

937
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,880
so this A to B leg

938
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,920
we're ignoring all this this is market

939
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,359
for traction okay this is the

940
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,560
manipulation

941
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,160
so with this out of the equation okay

942
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,900
think of this as

943
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,760
time distortion

944
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,460
it's running from the low to the high to

945
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,700
get that liquidity but once it does that

946
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,680
ignore it for a second because this is

947
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,200
not the 2022 model 2022 is something

948
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,400
entirely different where you would use

949
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,500
this price like oh you're confusing the

950
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,079
ICT I understand

951
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,940
if you watch the videos there's two

952
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,859
different approaches being used okay

953
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,920
we're using the price Lake from A to B

954
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,680
once this Market creates this run here

955
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,240
and starts to drop down

956
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,099
if I trust

957
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,380
that I'm on silent that means I'm

958
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,500
bearish okay I'm inspecting lower prices

959
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,579
I'm already

960
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,500
going short when it runs above the buy

961
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,640
side

962
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,920
it may not be my biggest position I

963
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,660
might scale in a larger portion I'll

964
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,339
give you an example um the model I've

965
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,599
been showing you

966
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,579
with trading ES

967
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,220
I'll go in and trade six contracts first

968
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
and then I'll add three and then I'll

969
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,900
add one for a 10 lot position so I'm

970
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,599
scaling in this type of trade here I

971
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,940
would go in with one

972
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,740
add three in here

973
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,859
and then six on a really good run into

974
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,140
the breaker

975
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,880
I'm building in

976
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,880
the likelihood of even if I'm wrong

977
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,440
and it goes against me on the six

978
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,599
contracts I have three and one

979
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,320
that help offset or mitigate most of the

980
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,119
drawdown that would be occurring if it

981
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,320
was to quickly reverse and take out that

982
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,420
high I'm not suggesting that you should

983
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,520
trade that way but I am trying to teach

984
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,380
you a little bit more in terms of an

985
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,180
amplification of the breaker pattern

986
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,320
because there's a lot of people on

987
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
YouTube a lot of people making courses

988
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
of internships and they really don't

989
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,540
know what you're doing and they're

990
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,220
really misguiding people

991
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,579
so to keep you from doing that and to

992
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,280
correct you this is this lesson's for

993
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,700
I'll have a lot more details about these

994
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,160
PDA rays in my books but uh I want to

995
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,740
give this today this A to B

996
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,040
price lag you take that leg from the

997
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,020
high down to the low and you lay your

998
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,119
Fibonacci on that and then you you do

999
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,280
your standard deviations lower

1000
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,200
whatever this range is from here to here

1001
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,079
one standard deviation lower that is the

1002
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,180
easiest bread and butter approach to

1003
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,240
using the breaker if you're

1004
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,040
on side and you know you're looking for

1005
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,260
it and you're in a fair market you don't

1006
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,940
need it to come down into this level

1007
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,440
here and trade back up many times you'll

1008
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,700
see me annotate a breaker and I'm

1009
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,099
entering in this price Lake Running

1010
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,660
lower before it even breaks out that low

1011
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,300
because I'm not a breakout Trader I'm

1012
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,280
not a break and retest Trader and so

1013
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,780
everybody thinks that I'm I'm chilling

1014
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,820
when I do a breaker no they have no idea

1015
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,320
you have no idea if you think that you

1016
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,960
put zero understanding what I'm doing

1017
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,180
I could be selling short throughout this

1018
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,460
entire range using the 2022 model

1019
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,320
and then use the breaker as an

1020
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,880
additional area where I can add in

1021
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,820
pyramid more or I can simply just wait

1022
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,980
for it to come back down or you could do

1023
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,180
that if you want to be very conservative

1024
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,640
wait for it to provide some means to go

1025
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,960
back up here now here's what you're

1026
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,460
afraid of

1027
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,040
what happens if I go short here and it

1028
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,720
goes right up here or goes into my stop

1029
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,400
loss and stops me out

1030
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,820
you take a loss how's that for logic

1031
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,099
then you consider does it still want to

1032
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,380
go lower if it does and nothing's

1033
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,820
changed you just got stopped out you

1034
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,380
just go in again with half the position

1035
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,540
size that you used on your first trade

1036
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,240
that's all you do folks you're not going

1037
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,740
to avoid a losing trade it's going to

1038
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,619
happen you will lose okay I have losing

1039
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,420
trades if I trade it every single day

1040
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,579
every single session and try to trade

1041
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,040
everything I've ever taught

1042
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,839
invariably I would have losing trades

1043
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,119
but what I have done over 30 years is

1044
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,220
I've determined the ones I really favor

1045
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,859
based on the Dynamics in the marketplace

1046
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,020
at the time the present narrative where

1047
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,280
it's likely to go where's the next

1048
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,480
drawing liquidity what day of the week

1049
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,060
it is what time frame what session all

1050
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,980
those things it's 30 years behind me

1051
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,720
doing that so when I talk about things

1052
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,460
in advance on Twitter and I show you

1053
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,560
executions I'm leaning on that 30 years

1054
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,760
experience

1055
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,440
that you don't have 30 years experience

1056
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,700
and I'm not trying to talk down or be

1057
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,280
condescending but if I try to do

1058
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,780
everything all the time and through a

1059
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,339
kitchen sink approach like many of you

1060
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,500
try to do and you get frustrated

1061
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,240
I'm looking at the best scenarios

1062
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,320
because I have the experience to

1063
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
determine it your time learning to use

1064
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,940
these tools you will do that over time

1065
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,020
too

1066
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,079
it may not take you 30 years obviously

1067
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,300
but I'm telling you it's going to take

1068
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
you much longer than you probably

1069
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,760
anticipate or hope to see it require and

1070
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,320
it's okay that's normal everyone gets

1071
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,119
excited about you want to go out there

1072
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,619
and try to use it right away

1073
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,420
but you're also dealing with the most

1074
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,119
ruthless industry in this world

1075
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,800
the financial markets they're they're

1076
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,560
not easy for a reason if it was easy

1077
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,260
everybody would be doing it but there's

1078
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,180
language I'm teaching you allows you to

1079
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,579
go in and see where there are

1080
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,500
opportunities for you to go in and

1081
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,240
exploit these inefficiencies or

1082
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,960
imbalances

1083
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,440
obviously like everything I teach

1084
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,660
everything can be reversed and what we

1085
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,760
want to see here if we're bullish

1086
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
this could be a reversal pattern or it

1087
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,140
could be a continuation in an existing

1088
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,960
bull market okay so if we're present in

1089
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,520
their buy program and we're expecting

1090
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,099
higher prices this can be used intraday

1091
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,079
any time frame by the way these patterns

1092
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,880
form but you have to understand where

1093
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,380
there's liquidity and the best Breakers

1094
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,740
are going to see two levels of sell side

1095
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,180
obviously the short term that would be

1096
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,200
created with the short term though here

1097
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,619
in the rally up and then a lower drop

1098
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:03,599
into a much more significant or a higher

1099
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,700
time frame South Side liquidity so

1100
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,200
there's two pools of liquidity that's

1101
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,900
being engaged here it's this one by by

1102
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,940
default that makes the breaker and then

1103
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,560
we're seeing it reach into another level

1104
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,000
qualifier that I like to see is I

1105
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,359
already anticipate this liquidity here

1106
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,880
lower

1107
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,260
drawn liquidity and I love when it goes

1108
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,520
down real close to it and starts to

1109
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,680
Rally because I know what that's doing

1110
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,619
it's enticing folks to see that that's a

1111
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,260
time to go long and this we're on higher

1112
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,000
Engineers more liquidity below that well

1113
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,280
it makes this a much more juicier

1114
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,920
liquidity pool so it drops aggressively

1115
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,660
down in here once it takes that sell

1116
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,339
side out I could be going long if I'm

1117
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,560
extremely bullish if on one side I'm

1118
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,540
trusting all my analysis everything is

1119
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,220
indicating that this Market whatever it

1120
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,619
is is going to go higher I will buy

1121
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,599
those sell stops

1122
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,220
now you may not have the confidence to

1123
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,500
do that that's okay you can treat this

1124
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,420
price room here

1125
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,119
you can use the model 2022 to enter in

1126
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,140
that

1127
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,540
any fair value you got in here that

1128
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,140
forms you can anticipate that that run

1129
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,780
or use the rules that takes out this

1130
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,940
High here

1131
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,280
any retracement back then later into

1132
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,619
that price run that would be a 2022 real

1133
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,980
rules but I can be entering in this

1134
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,200
without any need to take out the higher

1135
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,900
but once it gets down here my eye goes

1136
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,839
right to that leg from A to B and I run

1137
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,780
standard deviations off of that and the

1138
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,160
easiest bread and butter setup would be

1139
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,520
is using the low to the high

1140
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,200
being long in here or somewhere in here

1141
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,820
with a fair value gap for institutional

1142
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,859
order flow entry drill or inversion for

1143
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,540
your value got something in this leg

1144
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,280
here there will be a fair bag up or two

1145
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,960
back above it

1146
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,119
find some support

1147
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,400
Target here and then two

1148
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,780
legs of this run so in other words

1149
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,180
whatever this low is to this High add it

1150
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,220
to this high up so that would be one

1151
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,900
standard deviation of this price range A

1152
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,740
to B that is the easiest easiest just

1153
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,780
bread and butter set up you can

1154
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,359
literally carve out an income a career

1155
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,579
just with that but the wonderful thing

1156
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,880
is it's not limited to that little ICT

1157
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,920
is going to teach you how you take this

1158
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,140
information and supercharge it if you

1159
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,400
understand where the Market's going to

1160
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,280
go on a higher time frame if you're

1161
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,260
utilizing something like this pattern

1162
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,819
here to get in sync with a higher time

1163
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,500
frame buy model

1164
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,660
you can then use the standard deviations

1165
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,260
between point a and point B and see if

1166
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,480
they agree with a larger higher time

1167
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,520
frame pool of liquidity you may be

1168
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,460
utilizing for the ultimate bias

1169
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,980
or Draw that you're reaching for based

1170
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,540
on the entire time frame trade

1171
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,000
so I'll give you examples that

1172
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,040
all right so here we are looking at

1173
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,160
where we have opened for this week

1174
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,680
presently we are at

1175
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,400
July 2nd 2023 it's five minutes after

1176
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,160
six on this candle here time in New York

1177
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,420
is

1178
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,240
almost 10 minutes after six always have

1179
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,819
your charts shown on treating you within

1180
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:12,660
New York

1181
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,980
session there

1182
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,720
so here we have

1183
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,060
the low behind this is the five minute

1184
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,960
chart by the way low high lower low so

1185
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,599
this is a breaker

1186
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,240
inside of this price Lake from a

1187
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,040
to B remember we're bullish we're

1188
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,599
looking for the run from this low to

1189
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,920
high to do our standard deviations

1190
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,420
I already went through the idea of

1191
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,920
buying it here because we could be

1192
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,440
buying inside this Lake right there we

1193
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,780
don't need to see this High broken and

1194
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,599
shaded back to this support that is one

1195
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,400
way of using a breaker but when you

1196
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,720
understand where the Market's likely to

1197
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,660
go you can trade in this run before it

1198
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,119
happens so you're you're not becoming a

1199
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,220
break and retest type Trader like many

1200
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,359
of the critics will say that I'm

1201
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,220
teaching you to be no and I'm not a very

1202
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,720
common test Trader

1203
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,300
but this low to high to lower low if you

1204
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,980
take that a

1205
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,800
to B leg you're ignoring this as a run

1206
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,599
on liquidity

1207
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,260
so all this is time Distortion this drop

1208
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,280
down

1209
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,680
is both manipulation and time Distortion

1210
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,660
you are getting knocked out if you're

1211
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,180
long and using this as a stop loss the

1212
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,040
mark comes back down reprices that level

1213
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,839
does the Dirty Work of knocking those

1214
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,060
traders that have a sell stop

1215
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,960
below here when they're long but maybe

1216
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,839
briefly profitable and then drops down

1217
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,180
goes against them stops them out most

1218
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,819
Traders will not want to go back in if

1219
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,200
you did take a trade like that you get

1220
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,880
stopped down you wait for this type of

1221
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,960
scenario here where it creates an

1222
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,819
imbalance once it does that you can be a

1223
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,920
buyer right there and trust that we've

1224
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,300
already did a stock run with this run

1225
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,480
here below that low but A to B price lag

1226
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,800
you use that for your standard

1227
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,180
deviations

1228
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,020
if I show you the FIB right away you

1229
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,280
guys can see it if you want to take

1230
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,260
notes and that's what my FIT looks like

1231
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,060
okay from here to here you start running

1232
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,440
some areas where you have standard

1233
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,839
deviation of negative one so that's one

1234
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,940
standard deviation

1235
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,400
this leg from here to here projected

1236
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,740
higher so it's a measured move

1237
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,240
you're not measuring from here to here

1238
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,859
you're measuring here to here so it

1239
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:19,920
gives you 44.96 and a half that is easy

1240
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,140
easy easy bread and butter set up for

1241
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,880
entry right there

1242
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,380
we don't even need this High to be

1243
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,240
broken but

1244
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,300
inside this price leg we're using the up

1245
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,220
close candles

1246
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,740
more specifically if you look at it like

1247
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,760
this

1248
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
we have this level here so I'm going to

1249
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,900
annotate that

1250
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,119
okay so you can see it now I'll take

1251
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,020
this off

1252
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,180
this down closed candle right there that

1253
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,819
disrupts this price run so it's this

1254
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:53,760
range right there we would use all of

1255
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,880
that to be a buyer we would use all that

1256
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,880
range there for a return back into the

1257
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,780
breaker

1258
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,599
so this is what you classically see

1259
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,280
in some of my recordings where I'll show

1260
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,560
if if I think that we're going to go

1261
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,839
higher and need to pull back into a

1262
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,640
larger retracement

1263
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,440
we wouldn't want to expect that to hear

1264
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,359
because it's number one it's Friday of

1265
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,040
last week it's really close to that June

1266
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,380
16th High anyway so we don't want to see

1267
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,060
any deep retracements

1268
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,420
so what makes me comfortable buying

1269
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,520
inside of the price leg before a breaker

1270
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,660
is ever

1271
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,280
qualified

1272
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,099
based on my initial teachings in it and

1273
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,300
then you see it usually come back and

1274
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,839
retest it and then Ron it rallies higher

1275
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,700
we don't need that I don't need that

1276
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,200
sometimes you'll see me annotate the

1277
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,359
breaker and I'm getting along right in

1278
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,819
here and adding to an existing position

1279
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,859
or entering right away from there

1280
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,900
because I understand that I'm on side

1281
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,180
everything is indicated once I run to a

1282
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,619
pool liquidity or an efficiency above

1283
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,020
the marketplace and I'm including the

1284
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,300
idea that we're on Friday so the

1285
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,920
Market's going to be in a hurry to get

1286
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,220
to that liquidity and draw maybe up into

1287
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,579
that Weekly volume imbalance so we have

1288
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,099
two real strong factors acting like a

1289
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,920
magnet a draw on liquidity pulling price

1290
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,440
up so the algorithm keeps repricing

1291
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,579
higher it doesn't matter how many people

1292
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,079
come in selling short it does not matter

1293
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,240
what that volume is

1294
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,800
all the sellers can come in all they

1295
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,819
want

1296
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,920
all the book maps all the level two

1297
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,900
indicators of showing that there's a lot

1298
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,700
of you know sellers that want to you

1299
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,599
know come in the market doesn't matter

1300
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,819
the market is on this key repricing

1301
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,200
higher higher higher higher and you

1302
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,060
can't fight that

1303
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,160
so all this Insight here

1304
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,980
allows you to differentiate how we use

1305
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,079
my breaker

1306
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,839
there is not just one approach to using

1307
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,040
it you have to understand the narrative

1308
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,380
the day of the week all the factors

1309
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,540
involved and blending a lot of other

1310
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,400
things which makes it a little bit more

1311
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,500
complicated than your classic support

1312
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,940
and resistance idea that you're already

1313
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,740
failing with anyway because you can't

1314
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,839
qualify retail support and resistance

1315
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,060
based on what you see in books

1316
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,980
with what I'm teaching you it helps

1317
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,220
qualify very specific levels of dynamic

1318
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,780
support and resistance

1319
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,119
I'm not a support resistance Trader I

1320
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,380
have

1321
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,480
given you a language so that way you can

1322
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,980
see how the algorithm itself that

1323
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,040
delivers price will react and respect

1324
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,780
specific price levels

1325
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,099
now

1326
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,480
if we take this information

1327
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,880
and go one step further

1328
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,839
we have

1329
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:33,960
relative equal highs right in here

1330
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,520
okay see that

1331
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,920
so these relative equal highs what do we

1332
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,960
see above this relative equal highs in

1333
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,520
our mind we anticipate what by sound

1334
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,900
liquidity so when it goes above it here

1335
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,720
did it take out the buy side

1336
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,060
at that 44.96 and a half that was

1337
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,660
measured with this range here yet no

1338
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,240
but we can now use this as a qualifier

1339
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,339
for a new breaker so it could be

1340
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,619
reaching up there to go lower and if it

1341
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:04,339
was to do that

1342
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,619
we can anticipate how far it's going to

1343
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,480
retrace lower with the Friday

1344
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,700
retracement we can use this information

1345
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,060
with the breaker for targeting and not

1346
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,980
that I would be want to go short

1347
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,319
but we can frame if there is going to be

1348
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,599
like a

1349
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,300
TGIF trade where you anticipate the

1350
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,619
market trading back into the weekly

1351
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,660
range which is what we're seeing here

1352
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,880
it needs to get to this liquidity before

1353
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,180
it does that TGIF trade okay a lot of

1354
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,319
you were anticipating on Twitter

1355
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,900
reaching out to me saying TGIF is what

1356
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,339
happened but you have to see it get to

1357
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,140
the liquidity and fulfill its weekly

1358
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,839
range before it wants to pull back in

1359
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,400
so where does it

1360
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,560
give us details for that if you look at

1361
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,720
the high here which doesn't break above

1362
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,700
that 44.96 and a half it trades to it

1363
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,140
look at the high of that candle right

1364
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,980
there

1365
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,460
it's right here watch this one up here

1366
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,859
it's exactly at 44.96 and a half folks

1367
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,619
that's perfect remember that's this

1368
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,180
A to B

1369
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,520
it goes right to that level there but

1370
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,900
doesn't go any higher

1371
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,819
and it drops down

1372
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,740
and it creates what

1373
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,480
a breaker

1374
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,740
right there

1375
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,079
so now I'm not trying to go short I'm

1376
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,180
watching and trying to see if they want

1377
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,920
to reach up into here but how can you

1378
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,540
use this information

1379
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,059
if you want to be a TGI Trader and trade

1380
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,460
inside the range or a weekly range as a

1381
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,359
pullback

1382
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,579
look at this breaker here

1383
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,660
a b and this run higher this here is

1384
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,180
this part of this run

1385
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,880
so this is inside the range that would

1386
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,020
take you above because look at the

1387
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,300
bodies see if they're stopping these

1388
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,800
little Mohawks that's what a mohawk is

1389
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,780
by the way I ever have a level

1390
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,420
identified on the chart if I say Mohawk

1391
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,619
and I'm usually typing it out in advance

1392
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,599
so we can anticipate this is going to

1393
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,880
just do this and we expect that that's

1394
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,859
reasonable okay there's going to be some

1395
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,599
measure of coloring outside the lines

1396
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:58,500
that you're going to have to be

1397
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,660
comfortable with when you're trading and

1398
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,280
I have ways of determining where that's

1399
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,020
likely to occur my students are learning

1400
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,900
that and you're learning it now too

1401
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,520
the bodies are saying that okay we're

1402
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,859
not done it's going to reach higher why

1403
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,079
because this standard deviation of 44 96

1404
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,059
and a half was just simply confirmed one

1405
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,200
more time with the bodies that means

1406
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,940
it's going to go higher

1407
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,880
so we would still use this High to that

1408
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,099
low Watch What Happens

1409
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,300
a

1410
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,280
to B why not this one this one's the

1411
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,300
same one is this looked that low

1412
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,460
44.91.25 you're looking right up here

1413
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,119
that low is 44

1414
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,819
91.25 it's the same low I'm showing here

1415
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:42,300
40 44 91.25

1416
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,880
but what I'm doing is I'm ignoring this

1417
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,220
High here because it's unfinished it's

1418
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,300
going to run higher it's either going to

1419
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,920
go to the weekly volume bounce or one

1420
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,020
not that high I don't need to know what

1421
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,300
that is yet because the A to B leg is

1422
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,440
already there

1423
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,300
this one didn't go lower

1424
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,760
but now Watch What Happens

1425
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,610
how low can it retrace with TGIF

1426
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,680
[Music]

1427
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,990
two standard deviations

1428
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,220
[Music]

1429
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,980
inside this inefficiency

1430
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,740
inside of the breaker

1431
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,620
get ready to drop your jaw

1432
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,660
[Music]

1433
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,119
sorry folks Dominion mentors trying to

1434
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,160
teach my stuff don't have the authority

1435
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,559
to do this you have

1436
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,740
the range in which the breaker can pull

1437
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,119
back into

1438
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,339
the low when this candle comes in

1439
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:36,180
exactly at 4480.75

1440
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,980
standard deviation comes in at

1441
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,619
4480.75 folks that's perfect that's not

1442
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:45,059
Wyckoff that's not supply and demand

1443
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:48,359
that's not any other thing out there

1444
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:53,000
this is mine okay this is mine

1445
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,040
you're listening to the guy who codified

1446
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,800
it I am the person I'm the engineer I'm

1447
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,300
the guy that put this together this

1448
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,319
right there you're seeing it

1449
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:06,780
okay I'm writing all the books that's

1450
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,040
ever gonna be made around this right now

1451
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,079
by teaching it they're all going to pair

1452
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,579
it what you're hearing

1453
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,619
but that's precision

1454
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,960
you are not learning that

1455
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,640
from anyone else look at the date

1456
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:23,220
July 2nd 2023 everything changes with

1457
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,500
Breakers after today

1458
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,119
you don't know it yet so don't go out

1459
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,260
there and start making videos with it

1460
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,059
okay yeah you you're welcome to go out

1461
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,200
and start making videos where you'll

1462
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,359
observe this phenomenon that's that's

1463
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,400
wonderful because that'll not only build

1464
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,859
your confidence and share it with your

1465
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,180
community

1466
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,800
and you're part of my community whether

1467
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,380
you like it or not and that is helpful

1468
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,780
for you to teach yourself to see it

1469
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,020
observe it that you're blending so many

1470
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,059
things so many things come together

1471
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,920
let's go down to a one minute chart

1472
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,140
okay we're looking at a one minute chart

1473
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,540
[Music]

1474
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,059
okay so now we can see how we're

1475
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:09,059
utilizing the upper portion of the

1476
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,200
breaker here

1477
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,640
one minute chart

1478
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,460
you zero in on the change in the state

1479
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,760
of delivery that last candle right there

1480
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,040
inside that last candle I can be a buyer

1481
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,140
anywhere in here I can use that order

1482
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,760
block let me

1483
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,400
let me change this okay you see it

1484
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,079
better now see this down closed candle

1485
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,359
right there it's inside of this breaker

1486
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,160
it's the last up close candle when we're

1487
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,440
in the lowest time frame so you want to

1488
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,960
strip it down into the range remember we

1489
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,480
showed this entire run here on the five

1490
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,760
minute chart but for fine tuning your

1491
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,740
entry it's the last up close candle

1492
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,740
prior to the lower run to there

1493
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,900
when it's trading in that range if I

1494
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,420
have something else inside of this

1495
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,619
little pocket of price action

1496
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,920
[Music]

1497
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,660
the ICT breaker

1498
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,380
if we look at the high and the low

1499
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,559
if we measure that range

1500
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,440
okay and there's gradients to that

1501
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,319
upper quarter fifty percent or mean

1502
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,880
threshold because it's an order block

1503
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,220
Theory Breakers are order blocks

1504
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,440
and then the low and the lower quarter

1505
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,819
okay

1506
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:26,839
midpoint or mean threshold is

1507
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:29,700
44.84.50 now if the algorithm is going

1508
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,700
to allow price to be utilized there to

1509
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,440
go long but for smart money for people

1510
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,780
that see price

1511
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,160
like this

1512
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,680
what price does this Market need to

1513
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,880
price to to get 44.84.50

1514
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,150
it needs to at least print 4484.25

1515
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,700
[Music]

1516
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,339
inside of this consolidation it rallies

1517
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,140
above it and drops back down what's the

1518
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,280
low of that candle right there

1519
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,819
44.84.25 that allows the spread to not

1520
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,559
be a hindrance for a smart Lane to go

1521
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,020
longer even if you don't take that as a

1522
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,579
trade does the market show alone someone

1523
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:10,319
will move away from that yes that's a

1524
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,260
signature I'm watching that I'm seeing

1525
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,240
price do that I'm going to see these

1526
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,319
types of things come into the

1527
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,880
marketplace to support the idea that

1528
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,020
we're going to continuously grind

1529
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,880
towards that buy sell liquidity and

1530
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,460
maybe reach up into that Weekly volume

1531
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,059
and balance

1532
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,040
all of these things lead to a better

1533
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,079
understanding of where price is going to

1534
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,020
go and it's important for you to also

1535
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,640
know that

1536
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,220
once we're inside order flow we have

1537
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,740
inefficiencies we've seen the long here

1538
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,599
and then we're seeing an inefficiency

1539
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,980
here but we're bullish so we're not

1540
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,300
looking at this the trade up into here

1541
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,760
and then sell off I've seen so many

1542
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,900
people

1543
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,660
tweeting things and other folks that are

1544
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,579
in other mentorships and guys and gals

1545
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,680
out there trying to put people in shorts

1546
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,180
like this they say oh it's an

1547
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,859
inefficiency let's get short and then

1548
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,140
they have their faces ripped off

1549
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,740
what I'm teaching you is how to identify

1550
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,720
real order flow understand how the

1551
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,220
algorithm will reprice where it's

1552
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,280
repricing to and I'm giving you a level

1553
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,540
Precision that is unrivaled look closely

1554
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,640
you see this

1555
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,619
low

1556
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,900
High lower low

1557
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,940
remember I'm long in here

1558
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,300
here

1559
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,260
I'm buying all that

1560
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,059
all this in here I'm buying all that

1561
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,480
stuff right here I'm buying it there

1562
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,119
buying it there

1563
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,700
and buying it there what am I utilizing

1564
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,059
look at those levels look at them

1565
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,099
what am I buying

1566
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:46,559
CE of that five

1567
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,480
minute favorite what's defined by this

1568
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,819
level and that level then I'm buying

1569
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,740
what CE of the

1570
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,420
inversion parability gap which is this

1571
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,240
level here I expect this to be support

1572
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,260
and find a point of

1573
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,619
accumulation to send it higher to attack

1574
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,079
buy silicone and drop into the high on

1575
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,920
the 16th of June 2023

1576
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,200
so I'm using these reference points like

1577
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,359
rungs on a ladder okay or think of it

1578
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,760
like a mountain climber okay I would

1579
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,500
never climb a mountain okay I would

1580
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,980
never do that but when climbers Are

1581
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,420
Climbing they're looking for the next

1582
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,280
Anchor Point for

1583
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,440
to Anchor the Rope or if they're a free

1584
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,059
climber and they're not using any rows

1585
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:32,160
which is absolutely Madness

1586
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,960
they're planning their next grad point

1587
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,760
okay where they're going to reach and

1588
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,040
grab and hold on to that rock face and

1589
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,960
pull themselves up higher well I'm

1590
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,760
looking for all these areas as price

1591
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,920
presents them so when price was down

1592
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,900
here that fair value Gap was already

1593
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,940
there so I'm I'm accumulating long

1594
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,859
positions here right in the middle of it

1595
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:51,180
which is constantly encouragement of the

1596
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,380
five minute Fairbank which is these two

1597
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,420
blank lines that Gap was already there

1598
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,859
on a limited chart

1599
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,839
I want to see it straight up there it

1600
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,940
look at the body respecting it see it

1601
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,520
it's staying inside that Gap

1602
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,140
then it comes back down I'm buying it

1603
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,339
when it's in the midpoint of it right

1604
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,780
there

1605
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,180
see a little little pathway point right

1606
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,500
there

1607
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,579
I'm

1608
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,839
I'm sorry right there I'm buying it

1609
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:14,579
there and then I'm buying the low end

1610
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,200
range of it

1611
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,579
there

1612
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,799
so I'm accumulating and pyramiding with

1613
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,900
logic I'm not just you know willy-nilly

1614
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,339
throwing darts and throwing mud at the

1615
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:24,420
ball and see what sticks and come back

1616
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,299
and say haha look how smart I am no none

1617
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:28,319
of this is Cherry Picked this is

1618
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,640
absolutely

1619
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,140
engineered

1620
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,540
but now because we can see this low high

1621
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,799
lower low

1622
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,420
what else is occurring there that's a

1623
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,339
breaker

1624
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,740
that's a breaker I'm utilizing that all

1625
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,140
that framework I'm going inside this

1626
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,299
price leg with the support of this idea

1627
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,240
as a breaker because this is an A to B

1628
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,680
and this is all Distortion and

1629
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,780
manipulation I'm using that as the entry

1630
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,059
point but I'm going back into this

1631
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,619
little short-term price leg right here

1632
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,780
no way I see you're going to tell me

1633
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,640
yeah I'm telling you I'm going to prove

1634
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,960
it to you too

1635
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,400
low

1636
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,590
the high okay now watch

1637
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,740
[Music]

1638
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,559
all this is occurring by the way in the

1639
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,319
1150 to 1210 macro okay it's a specific

1640
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,260
sweet period of time where the algorithm

1641
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,880
will start spooling reaching for

1642
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,680
liquidity you have to understand there

1643
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,780
too okay don't listen to these guys out

1644
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,619
there to have 1150 or 12 10 you know or

1645
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,700
maybe my 10 50 to 11 10 macro times and

1646
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:30,839
they're trying to show you that they're

1647
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:32,760
doing something none of you none of

1648
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,220
looks listen none of you know what

1649
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,780
you're talking about if you're talking

1650
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,460
about macros you have no idea what

1651
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,559
you're doing stop spreading this

1652
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,599
information okay I'm not trying to be

1653
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,000
mean to you I'm not trying to be rude

1654
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,500
okay but you literally don't know what

1655
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,520
you're talking about

1656
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,920
but this lay here that's the A to B on

1657
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,400
that breaker

1658
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,000
if we take that

1659
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,440
and we know

1660
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,140
that that buy side liquidity is on June

1661
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,619
16 2023 High the daily candle it's

1662
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:07,020
drawing up into that and maybe even as

1663
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,480
much as

1664
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,760
the weekly volume and balance so we have

1665
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,559
this range right here

1666
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,420
that what I'm doing in other charts that

1667
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,619
you don't see me doing because number

1668
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,180
one for a long time I didn't want to

1669
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,559
share this information

1670
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,020
okay number one I'm not obligated to

1671
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,640
teach it to you and my charter members

1672
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,319
who paid me they're learning this too

1673
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:26,819
for the first time so you're right in

1674
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:29,220
here with mentorship this is mentorship

1675
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,900
I'm not doing paid mentorships there's

1676
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,520
not going to be an upsell later on come

1677
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,520
and join my club okay I don't want to do

1678
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,200
that anymore

1679
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,299
I want you to learn it correctly and I

1680
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,099
don't want people that are out there you

1681
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,200
know rebranding my stuff

1682
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,760
teaching incorrectly

1683
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,400
if anything is taught outside of what

1684
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,420
I'm teaching you here they have no idea

1685
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,799
what they're talking about

1686
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,839
but now we have three standard

1687
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,220
deviations

1688
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,020
four standard deviations

1689
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,240
five standard deviations

1690
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,119
six

1691
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,280
seven and a half

1692
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,140
where does seven and a half now if I

1693
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,760
show you six and a half that's right at

1694
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,900
that old high you see that 44 93.75 that

1695
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,460
right there tells me that that will

1696
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,740
definitely reach for that liquidity

1697
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,200
remember

1698
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,079
44.93.75 is the high of June 16 2023.

1699
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,880
what I'm doing is I'm showing you how to

1700
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,799
take the levels here for standard

1701
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,559
deviation and when they agree with a

1702
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,059
range of liquidity

1703
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:28,619
what I mean by that

1704
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:31,799
oh let's take this off

1705
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:32,640
foreign

1706
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,680
if we look at how

1707
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,319
the negative

1708
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:39,599
6.5 standard deviation comes in at the

1709
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,520
daily high of June 16th I know some of

1710
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,960
you already like man this is complicated

1711
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,640
I understand everything's complicated

1712
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,980
when you first started

1713
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,180
when you're in kindergarten you know how

1714
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,819
to write in the first few letters in the

1715
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:52,020
alphabet was too complicated for you

1716
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,520
then okay and that's all this is you're

1717
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,920
just learning a language okay but what

1718
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,720
I'm teaching you is we have an

1719
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,180
expectation the market will reach up

1720
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,440
into the liquidity Above This high at 44

1721
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,880
93.75 remember so I tweeted

1722
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,420
a couple minutes after nine o'clock on

1723
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,559
Friday

1724
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,299
to this range up here which is the

1725
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:13,680
weekly volume of balance so in that

1726
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,960
range right there okay if we take that

1727
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,540
range and

1728
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,240
use all the breakers for any standard

1729
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,700
deviation idea or approach to look for

1730
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,339
targeting you want to see a Confluence

1731
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:27,660
of levels

1732
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,940
anywhere in that range

1733
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,540
so if we anticipate

1734
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:36,180
44.96.50 which is based on that A to B

1735
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,740
price leg

1736
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,359
here to here

1737
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,460
that's where we got that from so we have

1738
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,099
that level then we have

1739
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:46,380
44.95.75 and in one new qualifying and

1740
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,119
confirming that the high on the 16th of

1741
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,240
June 2023 that is in fact going to be

1742
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,160
reached for how far above that level

1743
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,680
well

1744
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,059
44.95.75 is a good level

1745
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,359
and 44.96 and a half is a good level so

1746
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:02,460
any one of those two price levels is a

1747
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,480
good price point to exit

1748
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,260
44 95.25 you have to factor in the

1749
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,619
spread so I give myself anywhere between

1750
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:16,020
one and a half handles to a half of

1751
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,119
handle and if I'm really trying to show

1752
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,760
off I'll do one quarter of a point and

1753
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,559
try to you know let the spread do that

1754
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,260
but all those levels were based and

1755
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,760
framed with all this information here

1756
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,380
even though when I'm recording you'll

1757
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,119
see the link in the in the comment

1758
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:31,440
section or the description of this video

1759
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,020
below you'll see me actually do this

1760
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,059
trade and manage it throughout the whole

1761
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,559
process

1762
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,640
but I'm utilizing a lot of things that

1763
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,599
you don't understand these levels

1764
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,160
are dynamic

1765
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,640
and it's going to pull price to them

1766
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,160
all of the calculations that go behind

1767
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,680
how these algorithms price

1768
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,720
either commodities

1769
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,839
index Futures 4X

1770
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:02,760
all of them are using the information

1771
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,380
I'm showing you here

1772
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,200
this is not a harmonic pattern it's not

1773
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,579
some kind of white call stuff it's not

1774
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,960
supine to me and it's not Elliott wave

1775
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,240
it's none of that stuff

1776
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,000
it's understanding time first what time

1777
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,980
of day is this occurring the beginning

1778
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:20,099
of the lunch hour in New York

1779
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:21,839
the algorithm will reprice against

1780
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,480
existing liquidity what did the morning

1781
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,119
session see lower prices

1782
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,819
so it's going to roll back on what

1783
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,559
the stops the resting above these

1784
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,059
relative equal highs

1785
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,099
that's why you see me entering

1786
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,859
a exit of majority of the trade being

1787
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,359
taken off there why did I take the

1788
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,740
majority of the trade off there if you

1789
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,940
think it's going to go up to your ICT

1790
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,079
why'd you take the majority because it's

1791
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,420
Friday and I might be wrong

1792
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,039
this is a higher time frame Target that

1793
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,839
Weekly volume and balance

1794
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,420
so it doesn't have to deliver that one

1795
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,760
Friday but I felt very strongly that the

1796
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,880
June 16th high would be delivered but in

1797
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,280
the event that I'm not correct about

1798
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,380
that I got the lines portion of the move

1799
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,539
off at a logical place because I'm

1800
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:06,180
teaching you to do that very thing

1801
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,460
now I could have simply took a small

1802
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,960
portion off here in the larger portion

1803
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,220
off right here

1804
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,020
and then 15 contracts could have came

1805
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,420
off there and then my final right there

1806
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,579
and then eventually my single contract

1807
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,619
got stopped out there and I tweeted

1808
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,359
where I had my stock and where my target

1809
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,220
was which was the weekly volume balance

1810
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,599
just below it

1811
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,359
but all that is in the trade execution

1812
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,099
all the details you hear this is not

1813
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:30,900
Market replay it's not Market replay

1814
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,900
reports where it's fake okay we're not

1815
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,640
using ninjatrader where we can pretend

1816
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,099
to show profitability uh this is actual

1817
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,579
real Market executions these are real

1818
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,799
time

1819
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:45,660
applications I mean you don't see a

1820
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,740
replay up here it's it's real executions

1821
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,200
so all this stuff

1822
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,720
is helpful over time

1823
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,760
when you're utilizing everything that

1824
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,319
I've taught

1825
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,180
you're going to have to eventually get

1826
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,180
to the point where you

1827
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,460
refrain from trying to get the simple

1828
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,039
rate of right away figure it out and get

1829
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:08,880
out there and start making money because

1830
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,460
it doesn't work that way folks it does I

1831
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,839
promise you it does not work that way

1832
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,900
but if you want unbelievable levels of

1833
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,460
precision

1834
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,560
I'm teaching it to you but it's going to

1835
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,939
take you some time to get there but you

1836
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:22,259
don't need to have this level of

1837
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:23,160
position

1838
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,020
all you need is a simple bread and

1839
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,640
butter set up I taught you that tonight

1840
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,679
using a breaker you don't need to have

1841
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:30,060
the break and retest

1842
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,560
I'll talk to that tonight

1843
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,719
I told you how to buy and sell inside of

1844
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:36,000
the breaker before it even goes above

1845
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,859
its trigger point that I've already

1846
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:39,899
introduced initially when I taught

1847
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:41,460
Breakers

1848
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,299
foreign

1849
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,698
I'll have much more to teach you with

1850
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:50,698
each one of these PD arrays but for now

1851
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:52,500
this should suffice

1852
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,238
until talk to you next time

1853
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,838
be safe
