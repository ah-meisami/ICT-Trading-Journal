1
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,540
foreign

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,020
so I got tied up yesterday obviously I

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,119
wasn't able to get on YouTube with

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,100
anything but I did an execution shared

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,960
it on Twitter the link for that trade

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,240
example will be in the comment section

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,300
of this video

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,940
all right so let's go briefly through I

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,079
don't want to spend too much time on

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,760
this one because I have to hit the road

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,780
so a dollar Index is our weekly chart

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,460
obviously I mentioned in the commentary

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,399
on Wednesday that unless we take out

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,739
that low and trade into this

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,320
inefficiency one more time how it's

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
going to hold on to a bullish bias for a

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,379
dollar and bearish bias for Euro trying

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,120
not to pick tops and bottoms on a higher

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,920
time frame chart

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
so you can see the market did in fact

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,840
aggressively move toward that low no

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,380
problem I stated very plainly in

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,760
Wednesday's video that I'm not trading

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,000
Forex I'm not interested but a gun to my

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
head I always try to sit down and share

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,640
with the viewers and my students what my

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
opinion is on the market at the very

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,820
moment that the charts are being shared

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
with you okay it's a wonderful

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,560
illustration of

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,240
seeing me

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
outline something from an opinionated

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,780
position

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
and admitting up front that I wasn't

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,780
going to be doing anything with the

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,540
information regardless anyway but I want

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,400
to kind of

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
put some tent posts down so that way you

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,700
can

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,040
get comfortable warm up to the idea of

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,420
not having to be right okay uh

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,420
usually the septics I mean Skeptics of

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,759
me and my work they'll say well look see

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,500
he said that and it didn't do that look

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,020
at that we're gonna kind of like

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,060
make sure you understand in the proper

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,700
context because I do lots of video work

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,000
I do lots of audio clips and things that

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
people can listen to on Twitter and on

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,679
this YouTube channel

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,360
and it's very easy to take something I

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,540
say out of context and make a an idea or

53
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,580
an argument about okay set up straw man

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,440
arguments and I'm not here to try to

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,180
make myself look like I'm always right

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,500
in fact I was

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,260
kind of hoping that the dollar Index and

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,459
the euro dollar would do something

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,560
contrary so that way it sets the

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,080
Precedence going forward that you don't

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,560
have to be perfect and you can be right

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,180
sometimes

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,980
let's still be profitable

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,020
you can be incorrect

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,000
sometimes and still be profitable so

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
that means being profitable when you're

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
wrong

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,459
and I'm going to kind of teach that as I

69
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,379
go through this

70
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,120
so the dollar Index on Wednesday I

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
mentioned that I would hold on to a

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,900
bullish stance on dollar unless we take

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,019
out that low and trade into this

74
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,160
inefficiency now if we trade down below

75
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,840
it and come back up I would expect it to

76
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,260
be treated as resistance and then that

77
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,420
would set the stage for a run into these

78
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,900
lows but I have to see if we'll do that

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,959
obviously at the time of this recording

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,900
it's around 11 o'clock or so

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,599
in my local area here on the east coast

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,680
of the US and on Friday so this is

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
representing

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
not Friday's data but this is Thursdays

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,980
so I took the screenshot at this time on

86
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,220
Thursday

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,180
in the daily chart we'll be representing

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,159
that as well so all of this is

89
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,319
Thursday's

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,319
time it said this presentation will

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,099
encapsulate Thursday and then partial

92
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,260
Friday's action and I have to hit the

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,280
road so I won't be able to do anything

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
as a final review so we have a breaker

95
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,480
here on the daily chart we have high low

96
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,459
higher high down close canes on here

97
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,620
with the lowest close notice I'm not

98
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,120
using this one

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,159
I'm using the lowest close

100
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,920
the volume the narrative the storyline

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,080
is inside the bodies the Wicks do the

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
damage so you take that range expand it

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,159
to the right and that would be your

104
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,080
breaker

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,900
and I'm calling this a weekly breaker

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,899
but it's in inside of this range here so

107
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,880
I'm zeroing in on

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,100
the daily chart to get inside of what

109
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,660
this would be

110
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,280
over the course of

111
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,620
more than one week obviously but I'm

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,360
looking at that daily candle right there

113
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,479
so from a weekly perspective but not

114
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,460
leaning on the weekly chart

115
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
but that specific candle right there is

116
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,360
what I'm aiming at and drawing it out in

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,979
time and I mentioned how we worked

118
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,680
inside these levels here the weekly

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
mean threshold of the bearish order

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,699
block that's this level here 104.54 I

121
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,560
mentioned the daily order block

122
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
opening price here so it was lots of

123
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
work on that level

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
and then ultimately we did in fact trade

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
down here

126
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,540
I want you to think about

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,759
if you're hanging on every word and

128
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,199
syllable that I say

129
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,240
where I stated that I'm going to hold on

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
to a bullish bias for a dollar unless it

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,979
takes out that low

132
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,020
now what I'm suggesting if you listen to

133
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,360
that Wednesday analysis

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,979
I'm saying that I was not interested in

135
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,259
taking any trades I'm sitting still

136
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,680
I'm neutral I made a very clear

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,500
statement that I am neutral that means

138
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,180
I'm taking new trades I'm going to wait

139
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,580
and see what the market tells me

140
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,560
so

141
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,680
it was kind of like teaching

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,880
whenever I give something out in terms

143
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,500
of analysis or I call a move and it

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,900
happens there's a group of individuals

145
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
that follow me they're immediately

146
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,320
responding with Okay now what's it going

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
to do now what's next because they want

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,919
to see the next magic trick

149
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,560
and I'm trying to settle those

150
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,780
expectations down on all of you even for

151
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,160
the folks that don't reach out to me but

152
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,300
you're probably thinking okay you got

153
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,620
that right so now what's he going to

154
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,699
call next

155
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,259
so it's not that I'm trying to entertain

156
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,259
you I'm not trying to Dazzle you with uh

157
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,240
being correct I'm trying to teach you

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,100
how to manage yourself because come

159
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
November when I'm no longer doing this

160
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,039
with you all

161
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,680
it'll be up to you to stick to what

162
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,120
you've understood and learned as

163
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,639
rule-based ideas

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,460
so what I'm saying is I'm interested in

165
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,259
staying bullish on dollar

166
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,560
bearish on euro dollar as long as

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,080
we stay above this low

168
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
if I'm neutral I'm looking to take new

169
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,100
trades but if it does trade down here

170
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,780
then that opens the door for me

171
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,060
potentially

172
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,280
conceding and saying okay this is

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,620
probably much more meaningful and if we

174
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,660
come down below this

175
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,220
inefficiency

176
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm going to see it be treated as

177
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,400
resistance and then any subsequent

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,259
premium array

179
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,880
that would set up a later like a fair

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
value Gap something that effect or a

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,500
very shorter block maybe a breaker that

182
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,080
could act as some premium array to send

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,780
us into this area here so it's kind of

184
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,120
like my inner musing the thing I'm

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
considering as a potential future setup

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
but I can't do anything now because

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
we're going into Friday and I won't be

188
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,660
in front of the charts on Monday either

189
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,580
so I'll be back in the sooner things

190
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,060
next Tuesday

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
so here is the hourly chart here we got

192
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,400
down

193
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,039
on Thursday when we saw trading begin

194
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,520
again and we ran quickly down into that

195
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,520
low and then into this low here so

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,500
clearing up all the sell side resting

197
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,520
here we

198
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,580
aimed into that and now we have in my

199
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,240
mind potentially shifted bearish not not

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,580
convinced entirely I want to see more

201
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,620
evidence on that daily chart and get

202
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,440
below this inefficiency and treat it as

203
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,720
resistance okay so I'm waiting I'm

204
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,479
predicting that as a future possibility

205
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,979
in price action

206
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,900
the outlook for setups if it does that

207
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
so it's an if then clause

208
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,699
okay in itself it's algorithmic if the

209
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,160
market will do this then I will do that

210
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,259
but I'm predicting

211
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,380
I'm not reacting I'm predicting that it

212
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,360
will use this inefficiency that's shaped

213
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,580
here as a potential area of resistance

214
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,280
and treat it as a premium array and then

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,800
look for that lower daily relative equal

216
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,319
low where cell side would be residing

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
so it's a condition for me to allow

218
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,300
myself to sit still and relax and not

219
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,660
rush to get into another new trade idea

220
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,899
which many of you need that skill set

221
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,700
all right you're a dollar again this is

222
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,440
representing where we were at the time

223
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,899
on Thursday at this screenshot

224
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,179
so we worked inside this order block

225
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,820
here and

226
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,700
it's a weekly chart so

227
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,040
there really isn't any inefficiency in

228
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,500
this until we get up to here

229
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,360
so if we see that further breakdown on

230
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,700
dollar this will be the point of

231
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,260
Interest I would have on a longer term

232
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,779
for euro dollar

233
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,060
unless this low is taken out if Euro

234
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380
takes this low out then we resume

235
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,620
looking for these loads to be taken okay

236
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,860
so based on what we saw on dollar Index

237
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,560
on Wednesday's analysis I said that if

238
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
we saw that low taken out on the daily

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,399
for dollar Index

240
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,380
then I would push my near-term

241
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,080
bullishness on dollar to the back burner

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
waiting for more developing conditions

243
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,760
potentially setting up shorting ideas

244
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,500
for a dollar which would allow for

245
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,760
upside

246
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,700
on your own now let's just say for sake

247
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,820
of argument say it trades higher and we

248
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,320
get above this

249
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,839
entry says support that could be the

250
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,580
Catalyst to send us up into this volume

251
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,339
of balance that never got traded to

252
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,519
okay so we can see at one two three

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,800
dries pattern that would eventually much

254
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,380
later in the year become a factor okay

255
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,480
so I'm just giving you some forecasting

256
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm not stating that that's the Ironclad

257
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,320
gospel that's going to actually unfold

258
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,700
it's just these are some of the ideas

259
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,140
when I look at this chart that's what I

260
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,240
think this is a weekly chart so it takes

261
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,440
some time for those things to develop

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,060
right here is the daily chart of Euro

263
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,519
and we were Meandering around in here I

264
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,200
said I would stick with the idea that

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
we'll see if it wants to go lower enough

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,339
higher dollar and the higher dollar did

267
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,740
not manifest itself and I said I wasn't

268
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,200
sure if we go lower

269
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
if it needs to take out this High first

270
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't know so I was neutral I was

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,160
waiting for more information it did in

272
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
fact do that now this is where

273
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,019
critics people that don't agree with

274
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,580
what I'm saying or just simply don't

275
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,160
like the fact that you all like

276
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,779
listening to it and trading and finding

277
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,540
profitability in it they'll say they'll

278
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,880
cherry pick the things I say and take

279
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
them out of context and say well he said

280
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,700
it was going to do this and it didn't do

281
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,860
that what I stated was I was neutral on

282
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,300
Wednesday it means I'm not taking any

283
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,399
trades in Forex

284
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,620
I'm not using the dollar to trade I

285
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,880
don't trade the dollar I use it as a

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
barometer for risk on risk off

287
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
but index Futures can sometimes fly in

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,860
the face of what the dollar Index is

289
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,640
doing

290
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,380
so I'm a little bit more flexible when

291
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,380
it comes to index trading but in Forex

292
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,700
it's

293
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,060
almost iron clad okay if the dollar is

294
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,000
going to decline harshly that decline

295
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
the dollar would open the doors for a

296
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
rally in Euro you know cable pound

297
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
dollar Aussie dollar those types of

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
currencies

299
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,980
so we didn't see

300
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,860
in fact the run up in here took out that

301
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,660
high but we're still inside this order

302
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,640
block so as I'm saying I'm reserving my

303
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,899
verdict

304
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,820
on what this is going to do until we get

305
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,760
into trading so when I get back from our

306
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,399
road trip here on the weekend

307
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,740
I'll see how we close on Monday's

308
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,820
trading and then I'll give you some kind

309
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,260
of commentary probably on Monday evening

310
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,519
on the YouTube channel

311
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,500
all right so here is where we take the

312
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,180
context

313
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,420
and apply it to the real mechanics of

314
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,160
trading there's nothing wrong with

315
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,899
having an expectation and Analysis like

316
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,760
before you sit down go to bed you look

317
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,899
at the charts and you think okay well

318
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,480
this looks like it may do this or that

319
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,100
so you're predicting you're doing your

320
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,680
analysis you're looking for a setup or a

321
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,540
condition in the marketplace if it meets

322
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,560
that condition

323
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,500
then you'll assume a trade position okay

324
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,320
or incur risk when I stated on Wednesday

325
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
that I was neutral that means that I

326
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,380
have no interest in taking the trades

327
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,880
and even if I didn't say that let's just

328
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,980
take that out of the expression

329
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,140
and say that it was you

330
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,660
or I'll just stay on the hot seat ICT

331
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,360
said that he wanted to see your dog go

332
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
lower okay take out the the

333
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,860
um the truth and the fact that I said I

334
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,320
wasn't doing anything with it if I'm

335
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,019
stating that I want to see

336
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,360
the euro dollar or any Market

337
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,639
to set up a situation where we can be

338
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,000
going short on it

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,980
if the market doesn't present the

340
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,139
conditions for that short to manifest

341
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,279
itself

342
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,899
there is no reason to be upset there's

343
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,139
no reason to point fingers and say ha ha

344
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,139
you got it wrong or me haha iced tea got

345
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,940
it wrong getting it wrong would be

346
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,100
getting into a trade that would be a

347
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,720
failure and stopped

348
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,100
and with the loss okay there is no

349
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,740
there is no setup in here

350
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,380
that gives the expectation with time so

351
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,579
that means the time of the day that we

352
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:27,839
will be taking a trade which would be

353
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,120
what your your dollar could be traded in

354
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,339
the long and open it can be traded in

355
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,700
the New York open and or running close

356
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,260
there it is that's the that's the times

357
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,200
I'd be interested in even

358
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,000
conferring with euro dollar

359
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,920
we had these relative equal lows here

360
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,620
that I was trying to aim for did this

361
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,440
Market show any displacement lower after

362
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,720
Wednesday's commentary did it displace

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,160
lower create a fair value got the trade

364
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,440
back up into and then go short for that

365
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,920
be honest now did it form no the only

366
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,440
hand did was roll right up out of that

367
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,000
came back down found some support inside

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,279
of this imbalance which I'm sleeping at

369
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,500
the time I'm not watching it and it

370
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,680
rallies up attacks this high

371
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,019
mean threshold of the 60 Minute fair

372
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,700
value Gap over here it consolidates

373
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,740
around that then expands up and attacks

374
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,680
the buy side here so

375
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,300
profitable in the sense that there was

376
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,980
no monetary loss

377
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,540
but wrong

378
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,300
in expectation and

379
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,380
no ego bruise no Pride harmed because

380
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,000
there was no setup

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,839
that failed no setup manifested itself

382
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,560
so that's what generally the Skeptics do

383
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,600
outside of our community they'll point

384
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,060
fingers and say ICT said this and it

385
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,160
didn't do that hoping because in your

386
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,440
ignorance and very limited understanding

387
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,720
of what it is that I'm teaching you'll

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,519
see that and say oh yeah you know it

389
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,560
doesn't work or he doesn't not a traitor

390
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,180
he can't read price or he doesn't have

391
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,519
to do anything right

392
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
it's someone that is trying to

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,540
capitalize on

394
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,660
the viewing section of our audience that

395
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,940
doesn't know enough to know better okay

396
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,060
so there is no setup in here that set up

397
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,220
a displacement trade back up into a fair

398
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,839
value Gap and then run the liquidity

399
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,300
here here and potentially over into this

400
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,680
low but I didn't I didn't call that low

401
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,260
I called this area of Interest right

402
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,120
below that low here at the time on

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,740
Wednesday's commentary this little logo

404
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,139
was just inside this area with the mm

405
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,800
data I had on the chart okay so uh

406
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
it didn't manifest any kind of losing

407
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,839
trade what we want to see form that

408
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,000
gives us the framework for the trade has

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
to be there in price if it doesn't

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
manifest or make itself present in price

411
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,620
action there's nothing to do

412
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,320
there was no losing trade there was no

413
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,600
missed opportunity for a short because

414
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,639
it just simply didn't manifest it went

415
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,800
the other direction no problem you're

416
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
going to have that okay you're going to

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,579
have that occur with you in your own

418
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,800
analysis your own trading and you can

419
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
sit around and beat yourself up and say

420
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,040
oh I should have did this I should have

421
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,260
did that or you can say okay well I'm

422
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,980
glad that my system My Method my

423
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,180
conceptual ideas about how I'm reading

424
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,579
an engaging price action kept me from

425
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,440
taking a loss even though it didn't give

426
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
me the opportunity I wanted to pursue

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,220
and participate in

428
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,880
I was not able to incur a loss

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,920
and there's no ego harm there there's no

430
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,680
Pride there it's flexibility you have to

431
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
be flexible as an analyst the Market's

432
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,100
going to do certain things sometimes

433
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,959
that you just don't anticipate

434
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
and you're going to get that part of it

435
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,579
wrong but the the beauty is of not

436
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,740
fearing that because if you understand

437
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,380
what I'm teaching you my Concepts my

438
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
setups when they form

439
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,880
they're actionable but if they're not

440
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,399
presenting the framework then chances

441
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,620
are the likelihood of you having a loss

442
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,720
is reduced whereas if you just go out

443
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
there and trade on indicators or if you

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
trade on some willy-nilly idea or some

445
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,519
black box idea where it just constantly

446
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,099
keeps throwing ideas that it's a buy SSL

447
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,980
it's from my perspective that's you know

448
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,439
complete Randomness and you're going to

449
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,839
be more prone to being victimized

450
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,480
through that Randomness whereas we rely

451
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,640
on price actions to show us something to

452
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,679
work with and at the time of that

453
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,959
Wednesday analysis and commentary we

454
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,400
didn't see any displacement lower

455
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,980
afterwards so there's nothing to engage

456
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,500
here there was no there's no short that

457
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,480
failed there's no short that manifests

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,460
itself so that way you understand the

459
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
proper context it's not me trying to

460
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,660
save face and look smart and say ha you

461
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,299
know I I got it wrong so let me get up

462
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,880
here and pretend to give you a narrative

463
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,500
so you don't pay attention to it now I

464
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,760
want you to pay attention to the fact

465
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,700
that I called that to go lower into

466
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,620
these levels because a gun to my head I

467
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,200
had to share my opinion

468
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,120
it's easy for someone to sit on the

469
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,100
sideline say he says buy and sell and

470
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,780
when one works he comes back and says

471
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,080
sometimes there isn't a very clear

472
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,520
expectation from the time I'm sitting in

473
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,140
from the charts and talking to you

474
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,900
and I made that very plain when I said I

475
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,940
was neutral but gone to my head that

476
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,320
means I have to give you my opinion

477
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,020
right then and there I would prefer

478
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,480
to see the market run these lows this

479
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
low and maybe get in this area here

480
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,700
okay that's wonderful but did it give us

481
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,679
anything to act on no

482
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,419
so there's no reason to be upset about

483
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,280
it there's no reason to point fingers

484
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,320
and say the concepts don't work or I

485
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,020
can't trade or it's a scam okay it just

486
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,179
means that you are learning how to

487
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,740
navigate

488
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,660
navigating price like this is what

489
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,160
you're gonna have to do every other

490
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,020
system every other educator every other

491
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,220
Trader

492
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,320
has these environments where they go and

493
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,940
they expect to see something they really

494
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,340
want to see something form in price and

495
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,039
if it does they will trade that they're

496
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,740
predicting price

497
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,539
but that setup might not manifest for

498
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,260
them

499
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,600
and they either have to adapt

500
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,580
in Reverse or do nothing well I was

501
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,460
sleeping where all this was going on

502
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,500
so it had already ran up into this area

503
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,080
here when I woke up

504
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,460
so Thursday it was like okay well there

505
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,980
it is I mean so it's already moved

506
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,520
I'm not ashamed of that my focus was and

507
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,820
it has been on index futures

508
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,500
so a 15 minute time frame you can see

509
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,200
here that gap on the hourly chart let me

510
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,340
kick back up into it before we

511
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,720
see that and it's this right here

512
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,299
okay that by setting balance cell signal

513
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,460
efficiency it's a fair value Gap

514
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,020
the market trades back down until here

515
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,660
and into that shaded area which is a

516
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,179
fair value cabin itself

517
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,179
and we'll look at

518
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,860
now the 15 minute time frame you can see

519
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,600
it treated down into it here that's the

520
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,980
London session that's the London open

521
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,840
Killzone so there's your trade it's a

522
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,140
Judas swing and it rallies up admittedly

523
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,020
if I had saw this like this prior to

524
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
London

525
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,440
um I still wouldn't have traded because

526
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm not trying to trade Forex right now

527
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,980
but I would have anticipated it I'll run

528
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
into this area and how we traded at the

529
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,919
order block here

530
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,080
uh that would have been in my mind much

531
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,059
more impactful so we had a down close

532
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,799
handle there we rallied above it and

533
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,020
traded into that mean threshold of this

534
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,160
down close candle that you're seeing

535
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,500
here that right there that's a trade I

536
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,700
would have taken

537
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,679
I would have taken that but you know by

538
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,940
the time I sent and looked at the charts

539
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,679
it already moved too much and I'm not

540
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,360
interested but we have an immediate

541
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,340
rebalance there

542
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,080
and we have an immediate rebalance there

543
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,940
so when you see those

544
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,559
those are signatures that tell you that

545
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,940
the Market's going to want to quickly

546
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,340
get to some level of liquidity or

547
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,380
inefficiency in the old high on the

548
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,660
hourly chart was here to drove up into

549
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,299
debt rather hand ceiling

550
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,760
all right e-mini s p our weekly chart

551
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,919
you can see we did in fact trade higher

552
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,520
on that Weekly Gap and buy side resides

553
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,100
here and outside that we have this

554
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,740
volume of balance as well NASDAQ I

555
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,780
showed you on Wednesday I believe my

556
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,580
memory serves me correct

557
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,280
um NASDAQ has already traded up into its

558
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,380
secondary volume of balance but

559
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,480
the sap has yet to even take us High out

560
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
let alone get up into here so

561
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,419
s p unless it completely crashes we're

562
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,100
going to maintain an expectation that

563
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,020
we're going to look for this High to be

564
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,830
traded up into

565
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,020
[Music]

566
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,020
and on e-mini s p daily chart here you

567
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,460
can see that we had this box out of

568
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,440
balance outside and efficiency we traded

569
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
down into that I mentioned that it was

570
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
likely to do something to this effect

571
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,120
where we would trade down and then run

572
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,000
higher and we did in fact take out those

573
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
relative equal highs let's drop into a

574
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,580
hourly chart you'll remember this I at

575
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,940
the time of this recording I sent out a

576
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,340
tweet on my Twitter account taking you

577
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,780
to a

578
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,220
YouTube link that takes you to the 24

579
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,500
minute and five second Mark of

580
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
Wednesday's commentary where I go into

581
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,179
this hourly chart and I say okay

582
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,220
I'm taking your attention into this Wick

583
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,600
right here in the midpoint of that which

584
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,460
is consequent encroachment and I say

585
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,200
let's play Devil's Advocate let's assume

586
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,240
for the moment that the s p wants to go

587
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,179
higher if you hold that bias

588
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,280
remember I was saying on

589
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,220
Wednesday I was neutral so I was giving

590
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,740
you an actionable plan of study so we

591
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,260
can go forward okay not to say well you

592
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,520
know the market could go up here or the

593
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,780
market could go down here because if you

594
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
just listen to Wednesday's video and

595
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,080
commentary and you walk away thinking

596
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,179
that you didn't pay attention

597
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
you you have to listen to what I'm

598
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,320
suggesting to you because if you are

599
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,980
following this market and you're bias or

600
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,940
your

601
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,580
belief is that it's going to go higher I

602
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,860
told you how to engage that and it was

603
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,200
at that 24 minute and five second time

604
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,080
and it's this

605
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,260
Wick right here midpoint of that folks

606
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,240
this does not appear in textbooks okay

607
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,679
it will now because everybody's going to

608
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:53,820
start writing books on Amazon and

609
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,840
everything else and it's going to be in

610
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
mentorships now because you you watched

611
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
it panel

612
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,820
but there's still some things that you

613
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,780
need to know you just can't look at

614
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,640
every Wick the question is going to be

615
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,500
how do I pick that way right

616
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,580
well

617
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,679
below this consolidation this was that

618
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,299
Weekly Gap low and this is the weekly

619
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,679
Gap high and I mentioned that there was

620
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,480
buy side relative equal highs there's

621
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
buy stops resting right up here and I

622
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
stated that I don't like that retail

623
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,659
sees that as resistance I never liked

624
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,039
that that's what I said in Wednesday's

625
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,280
commentary I stated that smooth edges

626
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,799
like to be made jagged okay it's an

627
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,059
expression I've used in a number of

628
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,400
years and this smooth area will be made

629
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,080
Jagged and we've seen that today on

630
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,820
Friday this is where I took the

631
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,320
screenshot at 10 25 this morning Friday

632
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,419
and I mentioned that

633
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,799
let's assume for a moment and play

634
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,360
Devil's Advocate that the market does in

635
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,340
fact want to go higher

636
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,400
it can drop down into this Wick

637
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,679
that's this one here notice there is no

638
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,299
inefficiency there

639
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,520
there's no old high no support

640
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,980
resistance none of that garbage okay

641
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,320
it's algorithmic the Market's going to

642
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,179
return right back to that price point it

643
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,520
means something to the algorithm

644
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,559
it's a point of reference so the market

645
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,260
drops down clearing out

646
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,600
relative equal lows

647
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
how far can it go down below those

648
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,559
relatively cool those Michael to that

649
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,179
Wick is exactly what I said is a 24

650
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,799
minute and five second

651
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,679
in Wednesday's analysis it could go down

652
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,480
there and then run higher to take out

653
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,640
the buy side and go higher go back and

654
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,260
listen to that video and tell me if I

655
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,840
did not in fact say that if I lied and I

656
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,760
didn't say that in the video call me out

657
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,340
on Twitter everybody can see it you know

658
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,960
I don't let comments appear on YouTube

659
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,299
because people advertise you know crypto

660
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,620
stuff and make it look like I'm doing

661
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,120
that and I'm not doing anything with

662
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,600
crypto and I'm not selling you anything

663
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
I said this

664
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,159
this is what

665
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,840
analysis in 30 years experience and

666
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,539
authorship in these Concepts provide for

667
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,799
you

668
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,900
that right there it drops down just

669
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,179
enough for the spread to engage that

670
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,860
price

671
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,740
it rallies short-term High taken drops

672
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,299
back down in

673
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,980
rips higher

674
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,080
institutional overflow entry drill

675
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,740
into this bison efficiency

676
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,559
rallies fall short of this high in this

677
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,400
high

678
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
any retracement here is just going to

679
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,980
set up a run to take out the buy side

680
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,559
any drop here is going to further

681
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,299
increase the likelihood that retail

682
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,580
Traders are going to see that as strong

683
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,500
resistance so they will want to go short

684
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,940
here if they haven't already went short

685
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,440
there where they're going to place their

686
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,940
stop loss where they believe it's

687
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,100
protected in fortify behind this real

688
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,620
strong quote-unquote resistance well you

689
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,419
saw how that worked ripped right on

690
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,740
throughout like it's nothing this is a

691
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,020
nice hot knife right through butter

692
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,940
throw just knocking on heaven's door and

693
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Hallelujah

694
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,779
and here is the five minute chart you're

695
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,279
going to see a link in the comments

696
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,279
section where you watch me engage go in

697
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,039
right into the market and trade the

698
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,740
Silver Bullet trade for Thursday's

699
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,100
Trading

700
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,260
there's a level uh 42.90 and a half that

701
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,539
I had in mind I wanted to see it trade

702
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,620
up into

703
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,080
but I want to use my limit order just

704
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,580
below that

705
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,620
and there's an inefficiency rate there

706
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,700
that I felt that was going to be

707
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,020
impactful

708
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,419
so you'll see me waiting for a

709
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,039
short-term High to form and then when

710
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,500
that short-term highs ran out I teach

711
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,360
this to my students which is running

712
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,460
down Equity when you're approaching

713
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,960
targets

714
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,419
and or get three quarters of the way to

715
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,760
a profit objective

716
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,380
and you're bullish anytime you make a

717
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,360
short-term high and you run above that

718
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,860
short-term High you want to be taking

719
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,299
partials there I don't care what Tom

720
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,919
Dick or Harry says in their dollar menu

721
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,740
mentorships partials always pay 100 of

722
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,080
time there's never been a partial profit

723
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,740
taken that did not pay it always pays so

724
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,720
while you're learning I teach that skill

725
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,500
set

726
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,020
to traders that are learning how to

727
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,200
find consistency and to encourage them

728
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,539
to keep studying if you go in with I'm

729
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,039
only going to enter on this trade here

730
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,380
put my stop loss here and I can only get

731
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,000
out if it goes to my target you're going

732
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,320
to be very frustrated learning how to

733
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
trade like that so I teach a graduated

734
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,600
understanding with liquidity and trade

735
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,200
management that works it works folks and

736
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,940
you see me doing it many times in my

737
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,799
trade executions when it was with Forex

738
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,360
you watch me do it now that I'm doing

739
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,640
index Futures you see it happening there

740
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,020
and when you click that link in the

741
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,360
comment section it'll take you to a link

742
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,860
on Twitter and you'll be able to watch

743
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,200
me do the trade that I did on Thursday

744
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
which was working in this price range

745
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,679
here

746
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,940
yeah

747
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,900
all right here is those executions and

748
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,539
again you'll watch this live I was using

749
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,880
a two minute chart to get this in

750
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,220
Balance right here

751
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,900
and you can see that up here to the

752
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,539
Chart I apologize the uh the other day I

753
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,260
had the the late was it the labels or

754
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,020
whatever the titles or not toggle them

755
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,880
trading View

756
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,100
so you know just if you listen to what

757
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,539
I'm talking about in the commentary I'm

758
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,980
telling what I'm looking at in terms of

759
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,960
the market but sometimes the time frames

760
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,120
are not very clear I don't always

761
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,919
remember to say what time frame it is

762
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,620
but I'm trying to do better in that area

763
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,720
this is a two minute chart the

764
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,580
inefficiency or Gap is on the two minute

765
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,539
basis

766
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,460
and as the market dropped down you watch

767
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,340
me draw this out before price drops as

768
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,480
it slams into it I'm going I buy and

769
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,940
once it trades higher it comes back down

770
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,559
in what am I trading on this five

771
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,620
contract Edition pyramiding

772
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,779
high low

773
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,360
or low so this is my ICD bullish breaker

774
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,340
if we trade Above This High which it

775
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,960
does here

776
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,640
in here

777
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,980
and he retracement down into this I'm

778
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,140
going to view that as a reason for the

779
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,059
algorithm to reprice to it and go higher

780
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,159
it spends multiple times in it because

781
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,220
once twice three times and then finally

782
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,260
rips

783
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,460
once it creates this short-term High

784
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,980
here and we drop down as soon as we

785
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,200
route above it I took five contracts off

786
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,260
above that high at 42.88 which is also

787
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,419
inside of what

788
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,480
that hourly imbalance the old one okay

789
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,880
so some of you would say well you know

790
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,320
that's oh why would you pick that one

791
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,659
because it's in order flow and it's in

792
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,380
close proximity to that 42 90.50 which

793
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,720
is the actual swing high on the hourly

794
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,120
chart where a buy side would reside

795
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,039
and ultimately I put my stop loss up

796
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,360
here

797
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,720
and it came down and hit it I let the

798
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,460
recording go so that we can see it does

799
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,960
in fact go to where I was looking for it

800
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,159
to trade to

801
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,740
which was 42.90 that was the level I had

802
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,080
on here which would be two ticks below

803
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,299
the

804
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,659
4290.50 60 Minute old high so I'm

805
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,279
looking for it to trade up here

806
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,919
I use the 4290 level and then I had

807
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,059
limit orders

808
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,120
right below and to allow for the spread

809
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,860
to allow me to get out

810
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,779
and ultimately like I said it stopped me

811
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,299
out so over ten thousand dollars in in

812
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,399
one trade which you know by anybody's

813
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,600
standards that should be a pretty good

814
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,899
you know month let alone one trade uh

815
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,880
somebody out there might be thinking you

816
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
know that that would be enough for me

817
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,820
for a couple months to live on the

818
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,460
independent where you live and it's not

819
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,980
meant to then instill a sense of it your

820
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,899
trade has to be that high to be viewed

821
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,899
as ICT you know acceptable any

822
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,159
profitability

823
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,740
is good you know that that's your goal

824
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,960
so aspiring to trading to these levels

825
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,940
you know a lot of you guys are out there

826
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,440
with funded accounts you could do this

827
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,380
type of trade here

828
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,659
give it enough time building up your

829
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,700
your equity

830
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,740
this type of trade would be rather easy

831
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,940
to put on

832
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,100
and

833
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,120
you know it's up to you whether or not

834
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
you want to get to that stage you don't

835
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,000
need to do this well

836
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,080
you don't need to trade this many

837
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,360
contracts if you just did one

838
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,740
and then bought one more here and

839
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,779
pillared it and then got out up here the

840
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,520
same way is there something wrong with

841
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,559
that no it's probably better than your

842
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,620
job paid for one day so that's what I'm

843
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,640
trying to encourage you to think like

844
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
that so with that I'm going to wish you

845
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,620
a very pleasant and safe weekend I'll be

846
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,039
quiet on Twitter I'll be with my family

847
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,299
and uh we'll touch base with you all

848
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,399
Lord willing on Monday and so I'll talk

849
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,720
to you then be safe

850
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,740
foreign

851
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,619
