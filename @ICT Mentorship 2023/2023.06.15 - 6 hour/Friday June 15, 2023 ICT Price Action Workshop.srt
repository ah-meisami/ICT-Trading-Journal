2
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:2 8,880
good morning folks
the enemy is trying 
he's trying to keep you from learning today
almost choked to death before I got on here today
and then the audio was acting up 
so give me one second here
it looks like it's a little too aggressive 
in one second please

11
00:02:29,819 --> 00:03:15,280
this should be a little bit better
and it is a good morning
despite being a little tardy or reasons outside 
my reasons and circumstances outside my control
yeah I was trying to rush down some bone
broth before I got in there and I went
down the wrong hole and then the audio
acted up a little bit so I'm checking
Twitter right now if you all would help
me out if you can hear me if the volume
is good everything is five by five

25
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:38,080
awesome yeah it looks like the title
I have
I think I put the title on
for Friday
sorry apologize today is Thursday you're
not
you're not time traveling with me just
yet maybe after November this year and
you'll be able to do some time travel

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:06:16,180
all right so
I got a little bit of a
wild hair up my ass yesterday or
whenever it was a sent a tweet out
saying let's do a workshop
so I usually go on these long-winded
Twitter spaces and I promise we're gonna
be doing a lot of teaching today okay so
if you're here to learn I promise you
you will learn a lot today you'll learn
about FVG you'll learn about
PD you'll learn about 
time of day 
bias 
daily bias 
session bias
stops where should you look for stops so
you don't need a book map or any kind of
gimmick out there that requires you to
subscribe to something
I'm placing Insight in your hands so
that way you don't have to have any kind
of service whatsoever all you need is
the Open high loan close how to work
within the time frames I'm going to work
from the HTFs down to the
LTFs I'm going to teach you
how to back test today we're going to be
here for a while okay I'm not going to
be able to
promise you
a rant won't come in and out throughout
this session so I've allowed of 8
o'clock to 11. it might go longer I
don't know but everything will be
recorded
so if you can't stay here for the
duration if you're at work and you're
sneaking in here to listen in
shame on you you're stealing from your
boss I'm not trying to encourage that I
told you to call out
So today we're going to cover a lot of
stuff I'm going to cover 4X I'm going to
cover index futures
I'm going to cover a lot of things that
would otherwise be
kind of like the first day
when in the in the mid 90s I did
one-on-one teachings and every time I
would have a schedule or an appointment
with someone I would tell them
what would happen
the previous week
so that way when we would meet on our
first session together I would have
everything already in the charts that
already told them the week prior
so everything that I do and have taught
for years has always been on the premise
of me telling you before it happens
explaining what it's going to do
then we wait for price to do it and then
I can go in and teach more Amplified
approaches to what it is already taught
you conceptually on this YouTube video
or YouTube series Channel whatever you
want to call it in my mentorship all
those lectures and lessons

100
00:06:17,699 --> 00:07:33,860
if you are
looking for that real quick watch give
me something to start studying if you're
new you don't know where to begin I kind
of want to place this in the beginning
so give me like like 10 minutes of your
time and if you are
seasoned and you've been around me for a
while the next 10 minutes is not
necessary so if you want to go grab
something to drink go to the bathroom
real quick use that time here this part
is for the very very brand new you've
never been here you've never watched any
of my stuff or you've watched a couple
videos and you just feel like this is
too much information where do I begin
I want to kind of like put this in here
because it's also
a video
that I'm gonna
refer to in my first book
so there's a lot of things that I'm
going to be placing in this channel
throughout the duration of 2023 that
will help amplify the things I'm going
to teach in the book because obviously
books and charts that are static they're
not as Dynamic and as good as a teaching
tool whereas you'll hear and see me
doing here and you also knew on the 13th
of this week
what I said was going to happen in the
PA and it happened so that way
it's not like I'm cherry picking like
you hear people like to say I tell you
exactly what's going to happen and then
we go in and you see how the setups form

138
00:07:34,080 --> 00:08:09,259
so I'm telling you with experience when
you watch my live streams or if you're
watching on Twitter or if I say
something in a Twitter space that leads
to my opinion about where I think price
is going to go
your
task as a student here is to borrow that
experience from me okay it's not meant
to be a signal service a lot of you want
Johnny on the spot give it to me right
now so I can copy you that that part I
don't want to do
but I tell you what it's going to do
beforehand I do it on HTF
charts so it allows you enough time to
study it okay



155
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
so where would you begin if you're brand
new and you're a little lost in all this
information go to the 2022 mentorship
playlist there's 41 videos in there you
could probably ignore the first video
you know if if you're really in a rush
but don't skip anything a lot of people
like this to watch the first few and
they think they understand it you don't
so and you're gonna you're gonna see
that you don't know that because I'm
going to talk about a lot of things with
the 2022 model in today's discussion I'm
going to talk about Silver-Bullets
those setups as well there's a lot of
things here I got like two pages of
stuff we're going to cover
and my whole day is open it depends on
how
how much energy I got okay so I
rested well

176
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,300
but you can go right into finding setups
and
being convinced that there's enough
information in that 2022 playlist
on this YouTube channel to help you go
in start looking at things and watching
real right now go out there and start
looking for setups the practice
observing not trading okay don't think
you can watch it real quick and and try
to trade with real money okay it's
important that you understand you have
to slow down your impulsiveness to want
to make money I know it's an exciting
seeing the things I'm sharing and my
students sharing and all these people
that are claiming that they found
success with my stuff and that's
wonderful I'm honored I'm such a
in a position of privilege
to be considered your mentor and having
so many people around the world being
profitable now
but it's not a rush to get to that point

200
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,839
every single one of my failed students
and I have them I don't have just
winners I don't have just success
stories like anything in life there's
going to be folks that just simply can't
do it or can't do it yet and eventually
they get there
how much effort and time you put into
this is going to decide how fast
not that that should be a factor
but how long is it going to take you to
find your setup

212
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
what is your setup how do you determine
what that is because I teach a lot of
ways to get into a market we're going to
teach that today too
so
this meeting today this come together
come to Jesus meeting with the ICT
content is really focused on
where you should be
in your pursuit of learning
what you should be focusing on
and how to determine your path through
all this content because I teach a lot
of things a lot of ways to trade
different time frames to trade different
setups different entry mechanisms
different ways to take profits where to
take partials how to take partials we're
going to cover all that stuff today I'm
cramming everything in here
there's like a nuts and bolt kitchen
sink approach to ICT so that way you can
go through today's presentation and
determine where your area of study would
be best served for your personal
interest so that way you'll hit the
ground running or it'll highlight where
you're lacking
in your personal study right now you may
be hit and miss where you make some
profits in your demo account and then
you lose it and you go back down to
break even but you just don't blow out
the account that's a wonderful position
to be in you may not feel like that is
but it's a wonderful position to be in

248
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,160
because
if you're in there impulsively just
pushing the button you're probably
blowing your account you have no idea no
model no no frame of reference to to
anticipate anything happening in price
and we're going to remove that today so
that way at least you give yourself a
framework to go forward and study and
then you can start measuring progress
which is really important because if you
just simply watch my videos and this is
the part you need to listen to carefully

261
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,540
if you simply watch my videos or wait
for my next video to come out and you're
just a viewer
and you don't go into your own charts
looking for this information not China
demo real time
going back and look at old price moves
and we're going to do that today I'm
going to show you exactly what you're
supposed to be doing it's not hard
it's a little bit tedious in the
beginning because it feels like it's
counterproductive you're looking at
something that's already happened but
everything technical everything worth
doing is always based on studying
something as a case study that's
happened in the past how else can you
determine
you know a foundations or something you
have to have a a good foundation in
observing repeating phenomenon at
specific times of the day
with repeating characteristics that's
what I teach

286
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
so those Hallmark signatures and PA
that's that's the whole basis of what I
do as a mentor I'm teaching you how to
observe and find that I don't and I
can't promise you profitability that's
something that you're going to determine
based on how much time and effort and
organization you bring into this

295
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,399
last point and then we get into it
if you are lazy you will fail here
if you have an entitlement mindset where I owe you something
I have to do everything for you 
or I can't learn this unless it's one-on-one
or it has to be done live
I'm not going to be a good help for you
I will call moves
I will outline things watch my live streams
I call every smallest time frame Candlestick one at a time 
where it's going to go 
how it's going to behave
there is no better performance measurement than that 
if there is no way of doing that real time then 
there's no need for you to ask for
statements and give me a live trade and
trade live in front of me because I've
already I've already done that that's in
my live streams and I have a live
account with TD Ameritrade you can
actually see statements where I logged
in showed every single day
win loss exercise of drawdown came out
of drawdown just to teach students
there's nothing to be afraid of there's
no fear of losing you should respect
risk
you will lose trades everybody that
trades
every single method every single teacher
educator
um
everybody if you're going to put risk in
the marketplace invariably you're going
to incur a loss and you have to accept
the fact that's going to happen
how you handle yourself
how you handle your perception about
your ability to work through that
and stick to the model that you have
trusted that it doesn't have to be
perfect 100 strike rate is not possible
it's not realistic for you okay
but you don't need a high rate of return
or success rate in terms of Trades to be
profitable
and I'm not promising you get rich I'm
not promising you Millions but the
things that I teach in money management
and all those things factored together
can you become wealthy absolutely
can you quit your job absolutely can you
have a secondary incoming still keep
your job and just treat this as a
another side hustle sure
it's completely scalable to you
do you want to win competitions yes you
can do that too
so it's a matter of what you're doing
and why are you trying to trade and if
you're here to try to be the next social
media Superstar
that's probably not the best way of
doing it because you're going to be
impulsive everything you're doing is
trying to get ahead of somebody else
when it should be just about making sure
you don't lose money
and that you're working towards learning
how to be consistently profitable
and consistently profitable doesn't
equate to Everyday Trading
day trading is not everyday Trading
I promise you if you try to do it every
single day especially in the first two
years or so
you're going to have a whole lot more
losses than is necessary
which is the reason why I teach with a
lot of lectures and in the dry parts of
my discussions they're the parts that
you're going to come back to after you
tried to do this you made a little bit
of money or you found some success in it
you're hooked now
you want to keep doing it and have more
of that experience and then you have a
losing trade then you want to hurt let
me race it and fix it I gotta close the
day with fixing that loss and you make
it bigger and then you start that
routine of
chasing break even on the day and all
that does generally makes it a larger drawdown

394
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,779
so you want to avoid those those periods
and be content with okay you did
something wrong it doesn't mean
everything's broken but you can derail
yourself in your learning or if you're
trying to trade with live funds before
you're supposed to
you won't do well and it makes it harder
so when I teach
I give you 30 years of experience the
things that I'm talking about I went
through it I lost lots of money lots of
accounts I did it to myself nobody else
was the blame I did every single time
called I caused all that and you have to
be responsible with your own actions as
well
so if you make money using what I teach
you well done
I'm not responsible for that
if you lose money
well
you did that own it so I I'm giving you
my experience I'm proving that I can
tell you what's going to happen in the
marketplace with a great deal of
precision and you can learn that
precision
you can grow into having a very clean
understanding about price
what to anticipate and more importantly

425
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,059
when not to try to trade that is an
important lesson
and not too many people are over aware
really that that's an important factor
in trading
and that sometimes is the boring
conversations but I promise you once you
go in the drawdown
you're going to want to listen to those
parts in the videos again
and then you're going to wish that you
listened and follow follow the advice I
gave you

438
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
I want you to do well
I really really want to see you succeed
more so than you do
but there's got to be rules that you
have to follow and you have to give
yourself time to grow into it okay so
with that mindset and that
I guess goal in mind let's begin

446
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,799
after this presentation today over the

447
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,600
weekend you know you know I don't know

448
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
how much time you have to devote to this

449
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,760
today or the or the next couple days but

450
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,500
I did a live stream

451
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,860
on the 13th of June

452
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,960
and I talked about

453
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,460
some of the things we'll talk about in

454
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,799
the first hour of the presentation here

455
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,080
I'll do one hour

456
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,760
and then I'll break for like five ten

457
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,620
minutes I'll leave the recording going

458
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,200
so that way if you have to tend to

459
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
something relieve yourself or whatever

460
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm going to want to stretch out as well

461
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,320
and then I'll come back so we'll do that

462
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,900
like every hour of like a 10 10 5 10

463
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,059
minute break but the recording will

464
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,600
still keep going

465
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,679
for those that are really helpful in

466
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,780
their own recording and documentation

467
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,280
where I talk about certain things and I

468
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,120
have very

469
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,080
studious students that like to do this

470
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,539
if you would help me create a little

471
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,760
timeline for if I transition from one

472
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,620
topic to the next or if I go from one

473
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,200
market to the next if you want to send

474
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,620
me those minute markers on Twitter that

475
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,400
would be wonderful and I'll use those in

476
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,679
the comment section of the the video so

477
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,419
that way it helps people go right to

478
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,919
those moments I am not going to go

479
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
through this and do that myself but I

480
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,220
know I have a lot of students that do

481
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,260
that for their own purposes in my other

482
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,120
videos so

483
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,580
just let you know I'll appreciate that

484
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,020
help but

485
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,940
on the 13th I covered

486
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,679
my opinion about what I thought was

487
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,559
going to happen this week and when I was

488
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,539
doing one-on-one mentorships back in the

489
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,820
mid 90s

490
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,020
folks would

491
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,260
learn about me by me advertising

492
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,360
and I was it was a high-end

493
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,200
advertisement so it was people that

494
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,760
had a lot of money

495
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,220
and wanted to come to me and learn how

496
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,679
to do something with that money on their

497
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,740
own and had either already been in the

498
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,900
marketplace or was looking to do

499
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,960
something to get into it

500
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,059
so one of the greater selling points I

501
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,760
had was I would tell them much like I

502
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,260
did on the 13th of June 2023 it's on my

503
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,900
YouTube it was live streamed it wasn't a

504
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,340
pre-recorded thing everybody blocked me

505
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,440
out on it and

506
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,320
we talked about the CPI number and I

507
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
walked you through CPI real time

508
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,020
and I walked you through a 15 second

509
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,299
Candlestick chart so every single

510
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,820
Candlestick represented a fluctuation of

511
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,260
the highest high and the lowest low and

512
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,539
open and close of every 15 second

513
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,100
increment

514
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,620
now you don't see that in books you

515
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,820
don't you don't see anybody teaching

516
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,220
with that type of time frame but

517
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,260
everything that I teach

518
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,660
is fractal because it's the same price

519
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,400
whether you're looking at it from a

520
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,500
weekly chart monthly chart three quarter

521
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,539
I'm sorry three month chart a yearly

522
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,240
chart it doesn't matter

523
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,700
price is price what I'm going to teach

524
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,799
you today is a secret of breaking down

525
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,980
price and looking for that price

526
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,720
delivery continuum

527
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,600
so how to go in like if you ever watch

528
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,840
me do a presentation where I'm recording

529
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,340
my trades

530
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,320
if the comment sections are open or if I

531
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,840
share it on Twitter

532
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,400
most of the time you'll see a handful of

533
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,500
folks come in and say why did you pick

534
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,240
that time frame and why didn't you trade

535
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,799
this time frame why didn't you trade

536
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,120
that time frame I'm going to answer that

537
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,039
for you today and that way you'll know

538
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,299
what time frame you're going to be

539
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,260
looking at okay

540
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,640
some of the lessons today

541
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,299
won't be so impactful for you because of

542
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,740
where you are in your learning if you're

543
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,539
brand new a lot of this stuff is going

544
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,039
to go right over your head

545
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
if you stick with this and you study it

546
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,059
I promise three months from now if you

547
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,799
come back to this presentation

548
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,720
and you watch it you're going to swear

549
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,820
that I added something new but it's just

550
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,100
because your focus is on things that

551
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,159
aren't important to you at the time that

552
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,720
I believe I believe are more Paramount

553
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,919
and the most important thing is is

554
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,380
understand where price is going to go

555
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,620
so the selling point I gave to my

556
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,880
students that would come with me

557
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,799
one-on-one they would spend a whole

558
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,659
entire week with me Monday through

559
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,280
Friday

560
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,440
and we would be at the charts live when

561
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,179
the market opened up

562
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,480
I would show them bonds in s p

563
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,240
that's it it's all we'll talk about

564
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,820
and I would give them the previous week

565
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,960
I would say okay here's what it's going

566
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,100
to do

567
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,440
this is where it's going to go to and

568
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
we'll cover it next week

569
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,960
think about that

570
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
and treat it like what I gave you on the

571
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,179
13th of this week in a live stream I

572
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,640
talked about very specific points of

573
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,659
reference

574
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,520
in price for the dollar

575
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,960
euro dollar pound dollar gold

576
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,039
NASDAQ and Es

577
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,679
and DOW futures

578
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,640
so I'm going to go through those

579
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,020
individually

580
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,880
and kind of like it'll be somewhat of a

581
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,580
review but I'm going to teach also the

582
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,960
main takeaways and what you're supposed

583
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
to do with this information because it's

584
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,340
not like I saw

585
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,419
it's unfortunate I get new people all

586
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,919
the time on Twitter

587
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,200
and because they don't know me they

588
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,220
don't know my personality don't know how

589
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,580
to teach when I show examples

590
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,440
and we'll cover the reasons why I took

591
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,960
the NASDAQ trade in detail also for

592
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,299
those that are asking from yesterday's

593
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,559
Trading

594
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,679
post FOMC I'm going to teach you how to

595
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,960
trade CPI today I'm going to teach you

596
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,179
how to trade FOMC I'm going to teach you

597
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,640
how to trade NFP Friday

598
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,980
um it's MythBusters ICT Edition today

599
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,620
too we're removing all the talking

600
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,179
points that people like to use that

601
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,740
attract you from trying to study with me

602
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,220
I I teach you to avoid trying to trade

603
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,039
ahead of CPI I teach you try to try to

604
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
teach you to stay away from trying to

605
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,440
trade ahead of FOMC and a head of

606
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,900
non-prone payroll I have done many

607
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,600
examples of me Trading Post FOMC Post

608
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,159
CPI post

609
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,740
NFP I've I've done years of

610
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,780
that my students that were with me every

611
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,400
single day in private mentorship for

612
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,539
years

613
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,520
saw me explain where I think it was

614
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,500
going to go and watch it happen

615
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,419
so it's not that I'm trying to prevent

616
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,100
you or teach you that no one can make

617
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,559
money on those days it's because I'm

618
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,559
assuming when you're watching you aren't

619
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,840
a new I'm sorry you're you're a new

620
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,059
Trader that you're

621
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,340
experience is very small

622
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,900
you don't know what you're doing so I'm

623
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,059
trying to protect you from yourself

624
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,679
because I was my worst enemy and you're

625
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,000
you're worth anything right now you

626
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,320
don't realize it

627
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,919
but you are so if you listen to me

628
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm talk I'm trying my best to try to

629
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,880
give you everything

630
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,460
in the perfect proper order

631
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,320
how you're going to develop because I've

632
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
done this for a long time and I already

633
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,320
know what the questions you're going to

634
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,340
ask me

635
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,840
but many of the questions you're going

636
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,720
to ask are that's coming up

637
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,480
in normal development is already in the

638
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,340
videos it's on my YouTube video channel

639
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,039
it's it's it's it's layered across lots

640
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,020
of time because this can't be learned

641
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,340
real quick

642
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,960
because you're going to discover what

643
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,520
you think you're going into this to try

644
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,659
to do because a lot of you think you

645
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,820
want to trade the Silver-Bullet

646
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,919
a lot of you came in think you're going

647
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,419
to trade OTE but you

648
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,779
discovered the 2022 model

649
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,539
and that that makes sense to you so

650
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,179
right now your initial expectations

651
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:14,100
you're probably going to lose that maybe

652
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,080
in this discussion today

653
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
and you may develop a better focus on

654
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,039
what it is that you want to do and

655
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,779
that's that's a success for me and you

656
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,600
if that if you arrive at Ted today

657
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,799
that's a success that's a good use of

658
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,020
your time today but I promise you if you

659
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,480
take good notes not just simply watch me

660
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,460
take good notes and here's what I want

661
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,720
you to do

662
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,539
while you're listening to me today

663
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,360
don't try to write down every single

664
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
point

665
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,419
that I'm trying to cover when I'm

666
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,039
talking about FOMC and how to trade that

667
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,600
or trading CPI

668
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,340
or if I'm talking about Silver-Bullets

669
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,960
FVG or whatever that topic

670
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,799
is

671
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,400
write that topic or Focus point and

672
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,700
where I am in the minute marker or hour

673
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,620
marker on the playback all you gotta do

674
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,539
is hover over top of the

675
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,760
the little time thing at the bottom of

676
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,740
this video and it'll tell you where you

677
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,600
are when I'm talking about it and it

678
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,860
makes it easier for you to go back in

679
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,620
and dig into that that's good

680
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,419
note-taking because then you can go back

681
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,460
and go in and get the real nitty-gritty

682
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,500
to it and I'm going to talk a lot about

683
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,960
it in detail so it's important you do

684
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,059
that otherwise watching it alone is not

685
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,679
going to be enough and I know get to the

686
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,720
point get I hear you

687
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,220
all right so let's go over to the dollar

688
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,580
Index all right and this is a weekly

689
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,960
chart

690
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,580
and

691
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,000
I shared all this business on

692
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,460
the 13th

693
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,480
I added this a little area in here

694
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,919
this is a FVG

695
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,240
and I

696
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,559
have to be careful when I'm talking

697
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,380
because I noticed in the 13th live

698
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,400
stream

699
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,140
when I was referring to certain things

700
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,600
my cursor wasn't really where I wanted

701
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,919
to be when I was making points I'm

702
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,080
trying to make a conscious

703
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,740
um

704
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,320
note of making sure I have my cursor

705
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,360
where I want to talk about it so where I

706
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,000
have my cursor near that candle is high

707
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,299
and the specific close is what I'm

708
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,260
looking at

709
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,220
for that range

710
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,520
to that candle's low

711
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,539
okay

712
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,120
the candle to the left of this one this

713
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,080
one here that body of that candle

714
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,600
that is encapsulated between the range

715
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,460
of this

716
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,740
this candle is low here

717
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,240
that makes the high of the fair value

718
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,340
yeah

719
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,520
this candle's high or closed and I just

720
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
dropped it there it's so close it

721
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,059
doesn't make a difference

722
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,740
that candle's High

723
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,940
and or closing point

724
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,240
represents the low of the fair value go

725
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,539
the Shaded area is highlighting this

726
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,179
particular candle's body not the entire

727
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,340
body of the candle just the reins that's

728
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,380
being shaded here okay

729
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
between those two reference points

730
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,799
that is considered by my definition if I

731
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,080
call it a FVG its

732
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,320
classification is a BS imbalanced

733
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,539
cell side inefficiency meaning that the

734
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,760
delivery of price was on the upside

735
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,260
so

736
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,600
think about a paint roller okay and I've

737
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,820
used this analogy before if you want to

738
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,980
paint a wall in your home and you'll you

739
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,899
apply the paint to the roller and you

740
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,880
apply that roller to the wall okay

741
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,679
you're getting that delivery

742
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,480
up

743
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,279
if you keep doing that

744
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,520
from the bottom of the wall to the top

745
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,159
eventually paint will run out

746
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
and you'll see these little pockets

747
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
these little little pits on the wall

748
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,580
where paint didn't make its way to the

749
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,299
wall

750
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,919
so you already know what do you have to

751
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,559
do you got to roll back down over top of

752
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,659
that to fill in those little pockets and

753
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,659
gaps where paint was not distributed

754
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,600
think about price the same way

755
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,820
between these two reference points that

756
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,020
being this candle's High

757
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,480
and this candle is low

758
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,880
that one candle right here

759
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,440
in that shaded area that's purple

760
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,600
there's going to be small inefficiencies

761
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,559
in that range that's shaded in purple

762
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:38,820
the easiest way to to simplify it is 
we don't need to know yet where those small little pockets are on the LTF
because this is a weekly candlestick

767
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,320
so inside that range that range I'm

768
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,940
highlighting here with my cursor

769
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,700
somewhere along the line in that very

770
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,320
weak

771
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,419
of data there are gaps inefficiencies

772
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,399
we don't need to know exactly where they

773
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,799
are but we can identify that range right

774
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,860
here as soon as this

775
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,039
as soon as that candle closes

776
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,860
and we begin a new week

777
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,140
that Gap that's shaded in purple

778
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,779
we know that there's a likelihood that

779
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,940
the market will want to at some future

780
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,559
time

781
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,799
want to reprice to that

782
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,100
that is not balanced

783
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,440
all it means is that shaded area that's

784
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,580
purple

785
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,580
it's BS imbalance so the Market's

786
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,159
shown an imbalance meaning it wants to

787
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,740
go up it did go up so what is it

788
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,000
inefficient

789
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,860
is inefficient in the sense that it

790
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,919
hasn't had a SS delivery sell

791
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,899
side is when price is being offered

792
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,840
downward a down down close candle my

793
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,539
down closed candles are are black my up

794
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,580
close candles or bullish candles are

795
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,760
green

796
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,100
for that purple shaded area here

797
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,980
for that to be repriced to

798
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,919
and offset

799
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,140
the inefficiency of SS because

800
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,559
it's by side imbalance it's imbalanced

801
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,840
it has to be balanced later on and I'll

802
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,700
tell you how it becomes balanced but

803
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
right now it what is it lacking

804
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,100
it's lacking SS delivery that

805
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,659
means a candle must trade down

806
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,120
in between the high and low of that

807
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,559
purple range

808
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,140
and it's defined by the two candles I

809
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,340
mentioned here

810
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,360
this candle's High

811
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,120
that candle's low

812
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,279
so in our mind and my mind as an analyst

813
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,020
I'm looking at this and thinking

814
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,659
okay well we've seen a lot of back and

815
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,500
forth PA all through here

816
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,679
let me add a rectangle here

817
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,020
highlight because I knew I may or may

818
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,500
not have

819
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,840
my cursor exactly where I want it

820
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,580
as I'm talking because the live stream

821
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,740
okay so inside that darker shaded pink area
inside that rectangle notice how there
was a lot of back and forth up and down PD

826
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,880
you see how it's created like a small
little trading range in there
where is there a break
in all that back and forth movement it's

830
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,279
in that shaded purple area here

831
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,740
so up and down back and forth think

832
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,779
about that pain analogy all inside this

833
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,640
pink area

834
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,299
if price was paint in the canvas that is

835
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,159
the background of my chart is the wall

836
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,919
in that shaded area price has done a

837
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,840
very good job of moving back and forth

838
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,059
inside that pink shaded area but it

839
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,039
didn't do a very good job of efficiently

840
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,240
offering

841
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,039
SS delivery in that little area

842
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,299
right there

843
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,480
so what the algorithm does it seeks

844
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,339
those areas there because it's easily

845
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,859
defined by arrays old highs and lows

846
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,719
that are separated across the spectrum

847
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
of

848
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,339
three 24-hour periods

849
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,560
any separation between

850
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,780
this time frame or any other time frame

851
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,040
I'm going to teach you the price

852
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,839
delivery Continuum today so you can see

853
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,639
from one time frame down to the smaller

854
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,679
time frame how did you pick that fair

855
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,659
value Gap and not this sphere Vega

856
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,980
you're going to know all that today okay

857
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,020
but you won't retain it unless you're

858
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,580
paying attention and probably watch this

859
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,020
video a few times

860
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,179
so we know that there is a strong

861
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,440
tendency

862
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,060
for the market to want to come back and

863
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,460
re-price into these areas

864
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,159
now let's take us into what I was

865
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,159
mentioning on the 13th

866
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,379
for those that you want to go back and

867
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,940
revisit you've already watched the 13th

868
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,159
video I think it's a little less than

869
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,140
two hours long for the people that want

870
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,700
to get right to the point I'm going to

871
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,220
help you here okay you should watch the

872
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
entire video

873
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,400
and some wonderful information but for

874
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,720
those that want to just simply go right

875
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,480
to the points for the dollar Index on

876
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,660
the June 13 2023

877
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,020
PA lecture in market review

878
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,960
I was teaching on CPI

879
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
the

880
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,180
minute marker four minutes

881
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,880
you'll hear me talk about a price level

882
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,180
of 102.705

883
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,700
I want you to think about what I just

884
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,140
covered here on the weekly chart okay

885
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,780
I'm going to keep this just as it is

886
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,859
here

887
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,359
and drop down to a daily chart

888
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,320
so when I'm looking at price

889
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,300
I have all of this HTF

890
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,300
weekly perspective in mind

891
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,960
so if I were asked which time frame do I
spend the most time on? it's the weekly chart
now why do I spend the most time on the weekly chart?
number one as I taught my students one-on-one in the mid 90s
and the way I teach my students in mentorship
and the way I've taught and shared in those mentorship lectures on my YouTube
don't buy people pirating my stuff and trying to sell it to you 
it's been made available to you on this YouTube channel for free

906
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,320
go and study it at your leisure go your
own pace there's no rush 
I'm not taking the videos down in November 
they're staying up

910
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,740
that premise of how I go into the

911
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,380
marketplace and what I'm looking for on

912
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,960
the weekend usually either on a late

913
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
Friday evening once my whole family goes

914
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,980
to bed and they've turned down for the

915
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,760
night

916
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,820
I don't sleep like a normal person so I

917
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,160
do a lot of study really really late

918
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,839
night or early in the morning before

919
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,460
they wake up

920
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,320
or if I don't get that I do it on a

921
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,420
Saturday

922
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,119
I look at the weekly chart

923
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,060
in reference to a monthly chart a three

924
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,820
month chart a yearly chart and I'm

925
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,260
looking at it the same way I'm doing

926
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,780
here okay and I'm trying not to steal

927
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,720
too much Thunder from future lessons but

928
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,460
just know that what I'm doing here I've

929
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,440
done that with a monthly chart I do it

930
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,180
with a three month chart

931
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,859
and on trading view it's really nice

932
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,480
because if you go in you type 1 m

933
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,220
takes you into a monthly charges like

934
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,339
that

935
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,380
and right away you can see things that

936
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,540
you may not have noticed before

937
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
so you have a one month chart here and

938
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,079
right away

939
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,700
my long-term students can see right away

940
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,280
they're thinking wow that thing used the

941
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,500
volume imbalance right there the

942
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,540
separation between this body's clothes

943
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,520
and this body's open

944
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
that monthly candle went right up into

945
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,579
it there

946
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,940
and then went lower all month

947
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,560
so I'm looking at those types of

948
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,700
relationships

949
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,400
and you can look at

950
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,440
3M

951
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,560
it'll give you three months of data

952
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,359
you can see how we're drawing down into

953
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,220
this by side of balance outside

954
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,839
efficiency which is the same thing I

955
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,300
just highlighted in purple

956
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,200
on the weekly chart

957
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
that's this here it's the same thing

958
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,099
so in my mind

959
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,440
I like to look for those first

960
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,020
and if there is no inefficiency

961
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,020
then I'm looking for liquidity

962
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,359
so in summary let me rephrase everything

963
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,640
I just said

964
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,220
when I sit down on the weekends whatever

965
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,780
time I'm going to be doing my analysis

966
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,720
the market is not Trading

967
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,880
all of my analysis

968
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,300
is done when the market is not Trading

969
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,099
what I'm trying to

970
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,480
predict

971
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,900
to anticipate not react to

972
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,960
what I'm trying to predict and or

973
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,420
anticipate is where is the present

974
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,140
weekly candle reaching for

975
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,460
higher or lower prices

976
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,260
if I see an inefficiency

977
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,880
like this

978
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,720
right here that purple shaded area

979
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,599
I'm expecting price to try to draw down

980
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,940
into that

981
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,920
if this inefficiency wasn't there

982
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,619
I would look for that low because that's

983
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,359
where SS would reside

984
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,119
or consequent encouragement which is the

985
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,960
midpoint of this candle's tail

986
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,480
so it'll be this let me make sure I have

987
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,740
my cursor sitting here for a second

988
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,839
before I started saying anything more I

989
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,579
would either look for that midpoint of

990
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,400
that candles tail which is consequent

991
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,980
encroachment or I would use the low of

992
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,359
that Wick

993
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,740
there if folks listen if there was no

994
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,079
inefficiency that's shaped in purple

995
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,000
if that wasn't there

996
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
I would be expecting price to draw down

997
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,260
now why would I expect that

998
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,240
what makes me say that because we

999
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,800
already hit our targets that I covered

1000
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,140
in the previous weeks

1001
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,240
for those that weren't here I was

1002
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,500
talking about how dollar was going to go

1003
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,760
higher that we were going to use this

1004
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,859
shaded area here as an inversion fair

1005
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,540
that you got and treat it as something

1006
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,160
bullish they're trade up into the weekly

1007
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,079
order block which is this opening price

1008
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,599
of this candle here this candle's

1009
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,359
opening price that's the weekly bear

1010
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,800
shorter block

1011
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,140
it was acting as a Target then I said

1012
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,200
the mean threshold of that candle which

1013
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,599
is the middle point of its body in here

1014
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,140
that's the

1015
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,240
bare shorter block mean threshold that

1016
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,460
was also a Target

1017
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,440
so once it hit that we want to see

1018
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,599
what's going to happen once the target's
met
whether for the week or a day
you have to get comfortable grow real
comfortable with just simply sitting
still
and waiting move very very slowly when you're trying to make money 
and I learned this lesson from Larry Williams
it didn't make any sense when I first
learned it or heard him say it and it
took dozens of times of blowing out
accounts
not listening to advice

1033
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,480
move slow when you're trying to make money
move fast when you're trying to preserve it or protect it

1037
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,859
if you watch something paying out that

1038
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,020
you have done analysis on and you've

1039
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,000
been successful with it

1040
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,560
don't be in a rush to get another

1041
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,140
dopamine hit because that feels good

1042
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,880
that's a neophyte that's a brand new

1043
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,160
Traders trap you see many times

1044
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,260
individuals that are open about what

1045
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,640
they've done wrong

1046
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,619
and they use social media like a

1047
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,140
confessional father I've sinned look

1048
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,119
what I did and I blew my account okay

1049
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,000
you don't need to do that don't do that

1050
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
once you see something pan out

1051
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,579
meditate on that let there be a period

1052
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:06,900
of time between where you've seen

1053
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,700
something pan out you were successful

1054
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,859
and then

1055
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,260
really record how that felt for you

1056
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,060
because in

1057
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,440
the future you're going to have periods

1058
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,180
where you do something wrong

1059
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,460
and it may be a week long of that a

1060
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,619
series of doing things incorrectly and

1061
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,720
if you don't journal the times that

1062
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,700
you've done it right not just when

1063
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
you've done it wrong but when you do it

1064
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,339
right

1065
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,380
and you encourage yourself you remind

1066
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,060
yourself that you follow the rules the

1067
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,440
market panned out like you were hoping

1068
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,260
it would and you anticipated that you're

1069
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,000
conditioning your subconscious

1070
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,040
to hold on to that as a positive

1071
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,240
experience

1072
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,800
but when you're journaling you're not

1073
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,920
recording your negative results in a

1074
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,020
manner that is

1075
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,780
condemning you don't use language or

1076
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,660
terms like oh I was stupid or this stuff

1077
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,540
is never going to work for me never ever

1078
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,760
ever in your Journal ever

1079
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,819
record anything negative you can still

1080
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,079
highlight the fact that you did

1081
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,260
something incorrect but how you describe

1082
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,480
it how you encapsulate that in your

1083
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,220
Journal your subconscious is going to

1084
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,599
remember that because if you write down

1085
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,780
that you were an idiot in that trade I

1086
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,460
should have did this I knew better but I

1087
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,380
did this or that

1088
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,380
you're actually creating scar tissue

1089
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,060
and there's no elasticity there's no

1090
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,700
elasticity in Scar Tissue you you can't

1091
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,800
grow without a whole lot of tearing and

1092
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,119
pain

1093
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,420
so to remove that growth of Scar Tissue

1094
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,339
on your subconscious and the psyche

1095
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,560
that's required to to do this as an

1096
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,460
industry

1097
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,960
you have to make sure that you're

1098
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,940
conscious of what you're doing and

1099
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,619
you're guarding your mind

1100
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,540
social media

1101
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,680
is a a very big factor in why people are

1102
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,940
not successful

1103
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,099
so you think social media is going to

1104
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,780
encourage you

1105
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,240
and it might initially but what you'll

1106
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,000
find is it's very toxic

1107
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,020
and you don't want to bring that

1108
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,060
toxicity into your Journal because if

1109
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,980
you put it in your journal what you're

1110
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,040
doing is you're making a ledger

1111
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,280
of every single time that you have an

1112
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,740
engagement with your expectations your

1113
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,079
model and price

1114
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,000
and what price does ultimately is

1115
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,859
outside your control but how you

1116
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,900
perceive what you are expecting and how

1117
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,619
you record that that is Paramount

1118
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,099
in how you will walk forward

1119
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,140
by recording your negative experiences

1120
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,180
in a light that is devoid of any kind of

1121
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,700
judgment no kind of condemnation new

1122
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,339
kind of ridicule or criticism that is

1123
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,079
Harsh

1124
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,359
what you want to do is record in your

1125
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,440
Journal if you've done something wrong

1126
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,520
say

1127
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,040
I'm happy that I can see that this is

1128
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,960
where I can improve on this is my area

1129
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,020
of study that I need to work on versus I

1130
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,000
got stopped out here and I didn't listen

1131
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,859
to what the Mark was telling me and I

1132
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,960
kept trading against it and I you know

1133
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,000
went into serious drawdown or I would

1134
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,680
have blew my account there

1135
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,480
all that stuff

1136
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,640
that you're putting in your Journal

1137
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,099
their memories but they're happening in

1138
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,020
a level that's way deeper than just

1139
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,579
short-term memory

1140
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,560
you're

1141
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,599
you're charging it

1142
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,140
with emotion and energy that you will

1143
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,780
tap into subconsciously

1144
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,460
the effect happens when you like when

1145
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,740
you're a child and you saw a scary movie

1146
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,960
do you think every time the lights go

1147
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,000
off that event that what scared you in

1148
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,780
the movie

1149
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,880
you think that's what's under your bed

1150
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,119
it's in your closet okay

1151
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,339
your conditioning is called priming so

1152
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,020
when you're journaling you're priming

1153
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,720
yourself for future success

1154
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,640
it's brainwashing yourself it's really

1155
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,859
what it is you are tricking your brain

1156
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,400
to only see the Silver Lining which is

1157
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,760
critical it's critical because it's easy

1158
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,079
to talk yourself out of this because

1159
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,599
it's highly technical and nobody's going

1160
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,460
to cheerlead you nobody's going to

1161
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,500
coddle you you have to be able to find

1162
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,839
your own cheerleader inside you to keep

1163
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,579
yourself going because in the beginning

1164
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,800
stages of this stuff it's very very

1165
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,660
challenging because you don't know where

1166
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,460
you're going to go as a Trader and we're

1167
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,839
going to cover more about where you

1168
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,400
should go and how to determine that for

1169
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,260
yourself but you take all this

1170
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,420
information

1171
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,240
from a HTF I do this and I

1172
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,119
look at where price is likely to go

1173
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,760
it's only going to go up for one of two

1174
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,880
reasons okay PD

1175
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,859
PD continuum

1176
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,740
is the movement from where price is

1177
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,240
right now

1178
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,520
to Future delivery so where it's going

1179
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,800
to be five minutes from now a week from

1180
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,540
now two days from now two sessions from

1181
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,560
now

1182
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,960
it's going up

1183
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,900
to take out buy stops

1184
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,240
or it's going up the trade into some

1185
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,460
kind of inefficiency like a fair value

1186
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,300
guy

1187
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,160
that is it

1188
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,500
that's the only two reasons why price

1189
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,680
goes up period it's not buying pressure

1190
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,500
I'm sorry but that's the truth it does

1191
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,839
not go up because of buying pressure it

1192
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:10,980
doesn't matter

1193
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,980
how many people buy it

1194
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,560
perfect excuses if you look at price and

1195
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,420
study volume

1196
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,760
okay 30 volume how many contracts does

1197
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,599
it take

1198
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,700
for a limit up move

1199
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,960
in wheat

1200
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,180
not that you probably trade weed you

1201
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,980
only need one contract rated

1202
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,839
it opens up at the limit up move boom

1203
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:32,819
who can trade there nobody it's locked

1204
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,260
limit

1205
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,520
what was the what was the volume

1206
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,319
whatever that trade was that marked it

1207
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,140
that wasn't buying pressure

1208
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,000
that wasn't buying pressure it was only

1209
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,319
one transaction it opened it up here

1210
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,060
boom

1211
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,040
nobody else can buy it

1212
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,260
that's not buying pressure right so

1213
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,880
that's that was the biggest wake-up call

1214
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,319
to me when I was a commodity Trader in a

1215
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,460
million years that's how I started by

1216
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,540
the way

1217
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,560
um

1218
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,780
I realize that volume is important yes

1219
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,200
it does have a a place in analysis but

1220
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,960
too much emphasis is placed on that as a

1221
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,339
reason why price goes up or down and

1222
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,200
it's not

1223
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,619
price goes up to seek liquidity and if

1224
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,079
it's going up what liquidity is that buy

1225
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,099
side liquidity buy stops okay

1226
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:23,040
if it doesn't run for liquidity on that

1227
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,839
particular time frame it's going up for

1228
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:28,020
an inefficiency that means a gap

1229
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,180
a gap would be like that purple shaded

1230
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,260
area here

1231
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,720
or this

1232
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,460
I don't know what that color would be

1233
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,060
called we'll call it the a pale orange

1234
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,700
that gap between this candle is low

1235
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,900
that candles low over here

1236
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,099
and this candle is high

1237
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,660
that's what's being shown here in that

1238
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,880
little pale orange shaded area that's

1239
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,520
noted as the weekly inversion pair that

1240
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,680
you got that Gap

1241
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,780
and this purple one here they are called

1242
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,700
inefficiencies think about the pain

1243
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,339
analogy I gave you when price is moving

1244
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,640
back and forth in a defined range

1245
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,220
what's the Divine range here where your

1246
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,160
eye looks at Price just like I have it

1247
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,740
shaded here in pink

1248
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,380
price has moved

1249
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,579
rather efficiently

1250
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,800
inside that pink area up and down

1251
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,680
okay when price entered the low end of

1252
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,060
this pink shaded area now we don't know

1253
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,800
that pink shaded area is the range yet

1254
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,300
what I'm saying is when I'm looking at

1255
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,760
Price I'm looking at how price was

1256
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,920
delivered during a period of time

1257
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,319
in whatever time frame I'm looking at so

1258
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,760
this is applicable to whatever time

1259
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,900
frame you're looking at whether it be a

1260
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,060
weekly chart a daily chart four hour

1261
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,300
chart six hour chart 15 minute chart

1262
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,819
second chart it doesn't matter okay it

1263
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,079
does not matter

1264
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,660
what matters is

1265
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,880
where are the inefficiencies and where

1266
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,380
are the stops

1267
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,420
above old highs

1268
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,900
is BS or by stops below old lows

1269
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,839
is sell stocks or SS liquidity

1270
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,000
those are the two things I'm looking for

1271
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,579
after my eye goes through the chart and

1272
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,140
I'm looking for the inefficiency so the

1273
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,040
first thing I'm looking for is

1274
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,020
inefficiencies

1275
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,000
that's the first thing I'm looking for

1276
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,599
because that's the that's the array that

1277
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,700
the algorithm reaches for first

1278
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,680
it pans for

1279
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,240
any inefficiency

1280
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,000
if there if there's no inefficiency

1281
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,740
and we're in a premium and we're likely

1282
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,240
to go lower

1283
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,500
then it's going to be looking for sell

1284
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,460
sign

1285
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,819
reverse that if we are in a range and

1286
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,700
we're in a discount

1287
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,339
and there is no inefficiency above price

1288
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,619
but there's a short-term High

1289
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,500
it's going to run for the BS

1290
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,339
thank you

1291
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,900
that's what I'm doing on the weekly

1292
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,980
chart

1293
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,020
so for the folks that are hammering

1294
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,280
themselves and beating themselves up

1295
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,800
please teach bias I just did

1296
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,920
I just did but what you're wrestling

1297
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,380
with is you don't have time looking at

1298
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,540
charts like I'm showing you here you see

1299
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,760
this pink shaded area how the market

1300
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,980
entered it went up to this candle's High

1301
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,859
the next week we opened up here then we

1302
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,800
traded higher up to this point here

1303
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,079
then the next candle or next week we

1304
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,200
open we trade down and overlap all the

1305
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,140
way and into the previous high so

1306
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,000
there's no FVG formation

1307
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,800
whatsoever in the candle I'm

1308
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,079
highlighting right now notice that the

1309
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,700
candle to the left of it's high and the

1310
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,859
candle to the right of its low there is

1311
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,420
no separation like you see in that

1312
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,980
purple shaded range

1313
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,780
that's a FVG there is no fair

1314
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,640
value gap between the candle I'm

1315
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,380
highlighting here with my cursor

1316
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,000
using the candle to the left and the

1317
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,140
candle to the right

1318
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,660
so what is actually happening there the

1319
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,660
price has gone up and down up and down

1320
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,599
that's like that wall being painted very

1321
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,819
efficiently is there any inefficiency

1322
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,260
there no

1323
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,500
so at that time when we start on this

1324
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,720
week we open

1325
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,780
we rally up make the high and then we

1326
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,720
close after making a low here so there's

1327
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,380
been a lot of delivery up and down

1328
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,540
in between the Range High

1329
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,740
of this week

1330
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,780
and the close of this candle here now

1331
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,760
why am I picking that close it's because

1332
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,220
I'm showing you how prices reacted in

1333
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,140
here and why I was telling you on the

1334
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,540
13th in a live stream that can't be

1335
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,520
Cherry Picked it was told to everybody

1336
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,480
watching it that I want to see dollar

1337
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,440
reach lower

1338
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,240
okay and we haven't even got off the

1339
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,760
weekly chart yet

1340
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,099
I'm teaching what I'm looking at and

1341
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,420
this is what I'm trying to tell you I

1342
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,220
spend the majority of my time on the

1343
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,260
weekly chart I'm looking at how price

1344
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,880
delivered

1345
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,319
think about what I'm showing you here

1346
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,480
and how that relates to this area right

1347
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,900
over here

1348
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,500
think about that right in here

1349
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,300
that same idea

1350
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,720
we can apply it to over here

1351
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,760
I promise you I'm taking you somewhere

1352
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,140
even though if you think you don't know

1353
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,599
what you're understanding and

1354
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,640
confusion is probably peaking right now

1355
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,740
just keep staying with it I promise

1356
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,960
it'll make sense as I'm going

1357
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,180
same thing here price opens up trades

1358
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,660
higher back and forth delivery all up to

1359
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,000
the high back and forth and then we

1360
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,099
leave it

1361
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,980
so before this broke down

1362
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,980
is there any efficiency over here

1363
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,660
below this pink shade there is there any

1364
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,220
inefficiency inefficiency would be like

1365
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,940
this

1366
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,280
this candle here

1367
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,800
how has that separation between the

1368
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,420
candles High to the left of it and the

1369
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,579
candles low to the right of it does that

1370
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:53,460
occur or form anywhere underneath this

1371
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,559
pain shaded area in all this

1372
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,400
do you see that

1373
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,119
yes

1374
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,720
right here

1375
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,380
I'm just going to use a short little

1376
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,859
trend line

1377
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:15,300
promise you folks

1378
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,800
this is the stuff you're looking for

1379
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,380
even though you may not

1380
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,240
feel like it's important right now or it

1381
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,640
doesn't make any sense

1382
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,040
take you light years ahead

1383
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,880
moves to everybody else out there today

1384
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,740
so there's a gap there

1385
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,480
so I would take

1386
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,040
like this rectangle here I would

1387
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,359
highlight this but I'm only showing it

1388
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,099
as a small little section with the

1389
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,319
rectangle not being here but just simply

1390
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,900
using the trend line sections

1391
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,579
so we have an inefficiency here so when

1392
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,980
the market leaves this range it's in a

1393
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,880
premium

1394
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,460
relative to the low and where it traded

1395
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,559
to it's in this range consolidate and

1396
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,540
then it leaves it

1397
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,400
where's it going to go well there's

1398
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,200
several things you can use the

1399
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,119
consequent encroachment of this Wick

1400
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,700
midpoint of that

1401
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,800
then you have the gap

1402
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,640
here that this traded down into but left

1403
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,920
the majority of the Gap still untouched

1404
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,000
right

1405
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,440
so

1406
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,720
when it drops here price is going to

1407
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,240
want to trade into this area here

1408
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,339
does it do so yes

1409
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:23,220
and again that would be bias that would

1410
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,960
be bias for that particular week for the

1411
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,700
dollar what do you think that would mean

1412
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,460
for you Forex traders that want to trade

1413
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,040
pound dollar what would you anticipate

1414
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,540
that week this week I'm highlighting

1415
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,619
right here how would you use that

1416
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:36,180
information

1417
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,280
you would go into your charts and back

1418
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,280
test any long positions during the

1419
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,140
London open between two o'clock and five

1420
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,579
o'clock in the morning New York local

1421
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:47,099
time you would look at your am session

1422
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,420
Kill Zone

1423
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,460
the New York Killzone between seven

1424
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,660
o'clock in the morning and nine o'clock

1425
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,500
in New York local time

1426
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,380
you would look for the model of 20202

1427
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,300
you would look for optimal trade entries

1428
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,680
you could look for Silver-Bullets

1429
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,900
because Silver-Bullets form in the kill

1430
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,339
zones between seven o'clock and nine

1431
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:07,680
o'clock what'd I say yep we're teaching

1432
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,200
that again today too it's not limited to

1433
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,599
just index Futures and 10 o'clock to 11

1434
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,339
or 2 o'clock to three o'clock in the

1435
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,140
afternoon for index Futures if you're a

1436
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,300
Forex Trader everything that I teach is

1437
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,859
applicable

1438
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,599
even though you see me predominantly

1439
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,000
teaching it in e-mini s p and Futures

1440
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,200
contracts

1441
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,380
it's applicable to Forex

1442
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,000
you just

1443
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,800
there's subtle little rules that you

1444
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,720
have to worry about in time is the the

1445
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,940
the factor that's got to be considered

1446
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,660
because yes there are Silver-Bullets

1447
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,240
between 10 o'clock and one o'clock in

1448
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,920
Forex yes

1449
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,599
but they are really

1450
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,760
good ones between the seven o'clock and

1451
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,660
nine o'clock in New York Brooklyn

1452
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,059
Killzone in between

1453
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,579
three o'clock and five o'clock long open

1454
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,900
Killzone

1455
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,140
they're there every day every single day

1456
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,000
you have a reason for you to find a

1457
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,740
setup now

1458
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,140
again that is not an invitation for you

1459
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,880
to go in and try to trade every single

1460
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,400
day Okay so

1461
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,200
I want you to think about how the market

1462
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,780
moves in these ranges

1463
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,140
this is a balanced price range

1464
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,599
why is that a balanced price range

1465
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,819
because the market has moved up and down

1466
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,339
within it and then it left the range

1467
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,500
so it's going to leave the range what is

1468
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,180
the algorithm that's

1469
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,980
make an argument for a sake of folks

1470
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,119
that don't want to believe there's an

1471
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,380
algorithm that controls price and

1472
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,059
there's no amount of buying and selling

1473
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:35,160
pressure that's going to change that

1474
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,140
Market's going to go where the Market's

1475
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,940
going to go it's predetermined your

1476
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,619
daily high and low is predetermined

1477
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,319
whether you like it or not it is what it

1478
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:44,760
is okay

1479
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,400
how can we determine where that likely

1480
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,740
higher low is going to form or where

1481
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,540
would it likely reach to

1482
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,220
start on these HTFs and

1483
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,420
charts

1484
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,980
and if we know that we can see prices

1485
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,800
likely to want to expand lower think

1486
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,540
about because we're on what chart what

1487
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,859
time frame up here

1488
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:04,980
weekly so my analysis everything I'm

1489
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,780
doing on the weekend when the markets

1490
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,640
are not Trading

1491
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,980
I'm trying to determine what's the

1492
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,440
strongest directional bias

1493
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,240
that can be derived by looking at the

1494
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,800
weekly chart what is it likely to be

1495
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,900
reaching for on a weekly Candlestick

1496
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,040
chart

1497
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,680
it's going to either be reaching up

1498
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,780
for buy stops or it's going to be

1499
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,599
reaching up for a FVG above

1500
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,200
where the market is right now

1501
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,579
if it's

1502
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,800
likely to go lower

1503
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,200
then I believe it's going down to a fair

1504
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,780
value Gap below current market price

1505
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,760
or it's going to go down to reach for

1506
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,980
SS liquidity below some old low

1507
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,160
that is not complicated folks

1508
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,559
these things on your chart they're not

1509
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,480
hiding from you they've been in plain

1510
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,819
sight you just never been told to look

1511
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:55,619
at it this way because you're trying to

1512
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,619
apply indicators and all these things

1513
00:58:57,619 --> 00:59:00,660
and frankly you know

1514
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,980
when you look at like this you should be

1515
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,660
able to see it really quick you're

1516
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,980
seeing when I'm looking at the chart

1517
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,380
like this my eye jumps real quick to

1518
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,160
inefficiencies my eye jumps to that

1519
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,859
my eye jump to that

1520
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:15,420
that

1521
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,640
I'm probably moving faster in the

1522
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,440
live stream can keep up

1523
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,480
and then obviously the Gap that I just

1524
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,780
showed

1525
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,500
in every High

1526
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,520
every weekly Candlestick high and low

1527
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,460
is a factor as well

1528
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,920
they're going to be used again

1529
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,599
they don't just get used one time and

1530
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,799
they expire

1531
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,720
Okay so

1532
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,460
I teach

1533
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,040
there's a 60-day look back

1534
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,619
and the highest form of

1535
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,339
precision

1536
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:56,940
or highest form of accuracy in terms of

1537
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,520
my key levels

1538
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,099
I Define it with within that 60-day

1539
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,500
range and it's 60 Market Days not 60

1540
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,200
calendar days obviously but it's looking

1541
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,720
back 60 days so what I'm looking for is

1542
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,980
the highest high and the lowest low in

1543
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,780
the last 60 days I'm looking for

1544
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,700
inefficiencies in the last 60 days

1545
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,740
whether it be premium or discount that

1546
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,599
means a FVG like that per one

1547
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,020
here was before we traded down here

1548
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,400
in the beginning of the week the dollar

1549
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,440
Index was up here

1550
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,480
and on the 13th I explained it I felt

1551
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,940
like we would draw them I'm teaching the

1552
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,859
part that was not made available to you

1553
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,740
on the 13th live stream okay so I'm I'm

1554
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,960
filling in that gap of insight that

1555
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,940
wasn't made available in that

1556
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,619
presentation but this is the logic that

1557
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:43,140
went behind it

1558
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,119
so let me take this off and we'll drop

1559
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,680
down finally into a daily chart

1560
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,460
okay so here's the daily chart

1561
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,040
and let me take all this business off

1562
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,839
because

1563
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,299
they're all distractions

1564
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,819
and I want you to focus only on the

1565
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,000
things

1566
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,680
I'm making a

1567
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,160
point about

1568
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,220
all right so this inversion fair value

1569
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,859
Gap was an old Gap notice that it does

1570
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:25,079
not look like a gap on the daily chart

1571
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,000
where it did look like it on a weekly

1572
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,280
let me just for completeness sake drop

1573
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,440
back up to a

1574
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,480
weekly chart

1575
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,619
that separation from this candle is low

1576
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:39,900
and that candle is high the candle to

1577
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,579
the left of that it's only SS

1578
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,500
delivery

1579
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,619
it's a SS imbalance

1580
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:50,460
BS inefficiency sibi s-i-b-i

1581
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,720
it's a FVG but the

1582
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,180
classification is a city meaning that

1583
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,920
some future time the market is going to

1584
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,380
trade up and deliver price on the upside

1585
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:01,740
so it's offering BS delivery

1586
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,680
we see that happen here on this candle

1587
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,020
but I said that we would treat that as a

1588
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,000
inversion FVG go back and

1589
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,440
look at all the presentations and

1590
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,020
commentary around at the time

1591
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,599
but then on the 13th of this week June

1592
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,660
13 2023 I said that we would

1593
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,299
look for this

1594
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:23,940
old Gap

1595
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,099
okay this is What Separates Me from

1596
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,559
folks like Chris Laurie where they look

1597
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,020
at inefficiency and then he'll tell you

1598
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:35,220
it's done that's his terms it's done

1599
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,700
it's not meant to be disrespectful but

1600
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,220
when I tell people you can learn how to

1601
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,599
read PA with Chris Laura if

1602
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,460
you don't like me that's that's fine but

1603
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,780
you won't learn what I'm teaching from

1604
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,180
Chris Laurie that you can learn how to

1605
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,280
see inefficiency in the price I didn't

1606
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,079
learn inefficiency from from Chris

1607
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,599
Laurie okay I was trading before Chris

1608
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,160
Laurie but

1609
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,440
long story short this whole business of

1610
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,160
inefficiencies

1611
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,619
we can use them as real Dynamic support

1612
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,960
and resistance because that's in fact

1613
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,059
really how the algorithm refers back to

1614
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:09,900
them

1615
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,520
meaning this

1616
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,319
when I look at this range this shaded

1617
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:15,420
area it doesn't look like a fair value

1618
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,040
gap on the daily chart

1619
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,079
whereas that is a FVG you see

1620
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,760
that right there look look where I have

1621
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,500
my cursor at right here on this candle

1622
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,780
here go up

1623
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,640
that candle I'm laying my cursor on top

1624
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,040
of to the left of it that candle is low

1625
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,740
here and the next camel to the right of

1626
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,700
this one

1627
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,599
that came as high that is a fair Vega it

1628
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,280
is a civi so it's not a balanced by

1629
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,619
sound efficiency notice that that is not

1630
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,960
what you see inside of the Shaded area

1631
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,940
here that was the weekly inversion for

1632
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,420
your radica

1633
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,799
so the PD Continuum is when

1634
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:51,119
you have these HTF

1635
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,380
inefficiencies

1636
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,020
regardless of whatever time frame it is

1637
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,660
when you drop down to a LTF

1638
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:01,380
you cannot ignore or forget

1639
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,900
the impact that those HTF

1640
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,359
inefficiencies will have on the lower

1641
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,040
time frame

1642
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,500
the LTFs you can use for

1643
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,680
precision like refining risk and and

1644
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,319
making it much smaller so larger

1645
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,140
positions can be assumed that's not to

1646
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,760
say that you should take on larger risk

1647
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,339
but this is safer the sake of argument

1648
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,460
that you want to use a one percent risk

1649
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,319
model that means whatever your Equity is

1650
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:29,339
in your account

1651
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:31,859
times that by one percent whatever that

1652
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:35,579
amount is you can look at a range

1653
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:36,839
from where you think you're going to get

1654
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,059
in at the entry point and where you want

1655
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:40,920
to Define your stop loss

1656
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,780
and whatever that amount is you divide

1657
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,180
that by the one percent equity

1658
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,099
that you define as your maximum risk you

1659
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:48,180
want to incur

1660
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,160
having that the math will tell you how

1661
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,380
many contracts or lots that you can

1662
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,839
trade and still be within that one

1663
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:56,280
percent

1664
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,859
using LTF charts helps you

1665
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:01,680
define that risk rather small I mean you

1666
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,059
watched me to do it this week where I

1667
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:06,900
was using less than one handle on index

1668
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,920
features

1669
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,819
you cannot do that consistently in Forex

1670
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:15,180
promise you I promise you you cannot do

1671
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,000
that consistently in Forex

1672
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,599
the reason why is because Forex Brokers

1673
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,299
many times you're trading inside their

1674
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,819
specific pool of liquidity

1675
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:28,980
and they have the benefit of being able

1676
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,839
to open the spread on you when you're

1677
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:32,640
trading index Futures you're seeing the

1678
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,440
same price everybody sees

1679
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,420
everybody's high is the same everybody's

1680
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,980
low is the same

1681
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,099
that's why it's a gentleman's Market

1682
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:43,020
in reference to the ladies that's not as

1683
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,119
snub against you it's just a more

1684
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,760
refined professional Market

1685
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,319
it doesn't mean that you can't trade

1686
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:52,200
Forex and use small stop losses but

1687
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,480
don't don't fall into the traffic you

1688
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,880
got to do these Ultra less than two pip

1689
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,859
two pit one pip stop losses because I'm

1690
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,000
telling you

1691
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,520
if I ran a brokerage firm and I was a

1692
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,920
Forex brokerage firm I would open the

1693
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,599
spread all the time on all of you

1694
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,599
and I'm I'm teaching you so wouldn't

1695
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,339
they want to do it to you

1696
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:12,420
of course they're going to do it to you

1697
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,740
especially if you're if you're trying to

1698
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,500
trade size and you get frustrated and

1699
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,299
when everybody was trading Forex you

1700
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,220
know in the early 2000s

1701
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,780
um there was bucket shops all the time

1702
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,520
and I got burned by several of them and

1703
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,240
fxcm was one of them okay and it's just

1704
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,940
they did it they they did things that

1705
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,400
were not good and

1706
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,859
it's better now obviously but I don't

1707
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:37,440
ever talk about workers so I know some

1708
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,400
of you are hoping that I'm going to talk

1709
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,780
about Book Broker would you recommend I

1710
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,039
don't do that I'm not an introducing

1711
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,619
broker it's for you to determine that

1712
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,839
okay so I'm not in an affiliation with

1713
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,819
anybody no brokerage firm new funding

1714
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:50,220
accounts nothing and that's the reason

1715
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,619
why I'm Point Blank and sometimes not

1716
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,420
always the best person to talk about

1717
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,520
your company because if I don't like it

1718
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,960
I'm going to tell you but I'm not going

1719
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,180
to sugarcoat something and say here

1720
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,160
I have an affiliation with this company

1721
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,579
I like them no

1722
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:07,920
whatever I tell you is the truth if it's

1723
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,720
good I'll tell you if it's bad it's it

1724
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,460
is but I'm not trying to tell you to go

1725
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,220
with any broker they all suck and

1726
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,020
they're all great it depends on what

1727
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,520
your personal experience is so there you

1728
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,020
go there's my opinion

1729
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,960
but these inefficiencies these gaps from

1730
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,400
the HTF you have to have

1731
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,839
them annotated

1732
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:28,859
on your chart now in the future you'll

1733
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:31,440
probably graduate to a point where I

1734
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,420
haven't just on a piece of paper like I

1735
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,559
have a pad

1736
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,900
I have a small little yellow pad that I

1737
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,520
work with all the time

1738
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,400
and whatever Market I'm following I have

1739
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,260
those levels noted what levels am I

1740
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,240
talking about the highest high and the

1741
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,400
lowest low in the midpoint of every

1742
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,559
inefficiency on a HTF for

1743
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:50,819
that particular market so we're looking

1744
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,619
at the dollar Index

1745
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:55,319
so it obviously is taking me more time

1746
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:57,240
to tell you what you're doing with this

1747
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,819
chart and what you're supposed to focus

1748
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:02,280
on and what you're supposed to utilize

1749
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,200
but once you understand it's like riding

1750
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,000
a bike you'll go through the motions and

1751
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,500
it won't take this long to go through it

1752
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,240
but the majority of the time your

1753
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,339
analysis will be done on the higher time

1754
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:13,380
frame weekly chart you'll be doing these

1755
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,180
things looking at where is it likely to

1756
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,479
gravitate to now

1757
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,198
rewind back to the 13th of June 2023

1758
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,540
earlier in the week in the live stream I

1759
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,319
talked about how

1760
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,939
I felt that this shaded area here the

1761
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,560
weekly inversion for everybody got would

1762
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,899
then now act as an inversion fair value

1763
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,580
gap for the downside in other words it

1764
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,738
would act as resistance we would want to

1765
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,719
see signatures in price

1766
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,698
showing a willingness to put a dollar

1767
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:44,759
Index to go up to it

1768
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:46,979
treat it like a ceiling

1769
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,399
reject it and send it lower

1770
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,960
now

1771
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,960
I am not a support resistance Trader I

1772
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,880
know I supply and demand Trader okay

1773
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,698
even though that that shaded area May

1774
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:01,198
quickly look like if you're someone

1775
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,759
that's traded with the same side and

1776
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,979
Online Trading Academy and all that

1777
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:07,080
stuff I get accused of using Supply

1778
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,899
demand all the time it's not that okay I

1779
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:12,719
use very very specific levels

1780
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,000
and they would never consider that Gap

1781
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,580
back their nuclear chart ever again and

1782
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,839
they wouldn't considered anyway really

1783
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:23,040
but this is what I refer to that shaded

1784
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,799
area that pale orange range I'm looking

1785
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,960
at the highest point of it

1786
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,580
the midpoint

1787
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,020
and the low

1788
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,198
there's three specific levels there I'm

1789
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:36,000
not in is I am big U.S it's not like

1790
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,960
here's a tree it's a supply Zone okay

1791
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,160
that's wonderful

1792
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,560
what are you going to trade at what

1793
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,839
level are you looking at

1794
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,319
so

1795
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:51,560
from a

1796
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,580
I don't know I guess a grade school

1797
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:56,940
perspective supply and demand may help

1798
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,020
someone you maybe you have been

1799
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,660
profitable with it but it doesn't give

1800
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,340
you a very specific level to trade on

1801
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,840
you have to determine where you're going

1802
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,940
to trade at so it's like here in this

1803
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,320
general area let's try to find something

1804
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,179
that's a buyer sell

1805
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:11,640
what I'm telling you is the algorithm

1806
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,440
itself will refer to one of those three

1807
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,699
price levels

1808
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,739
which price level do I use which one is

1809
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:18,420
it hidden at the time of the day did I

1810
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,739
tell you to look at it

1811
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,260
that's where time comes in so when I'm

1812
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,640
teaching you I'm teaching how the

1813
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,280
algorithm Works how it delivers price it

1814
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,380
operates on time delivery that means

1815
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,780
everything every price run is scheduled

1816
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,580
sorry I know you probably worked in an

1817
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,900
industry for a long time and you're

1818
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,219
probably cussing and laughing saying

1819
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:37,500
this guy's full of I don't see you

1820
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,640
out here telling everybody where it's

1821
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,659
going to go before it's going to go

1822
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:41,699
there to the infinite degree of

1823
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,620
precision that I'm showing

1824
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,260
so I'm I'm proving you I can't take you

1825
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,000
I can't take you somewhere on a field

1826
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,800
trip and say Here's Where the algorithm

1827
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,620
is ran from I can't take you to a place

1828
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,960
and say here is where it's operating

1829
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,460
from okay

1830
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,040
the only thing I can do is tell you the

1831
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,360
truth it is there

1832
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,520
it's running it's delivering price all

1833
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,500
the time it's completely manipulated

1834
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,360
it's absolutely controlled always and

1835
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,500
you shouldn't be fearful that you

1836
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,060
shouldn't be upset about that you should

1837
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,560
be thankful that that is an advantage

1838
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,640
because once you understand how it

1839
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,280
operates you can exploit that

1840
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,840
they're not going to change it because

1841
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,719
the way that price is offered and how

1842
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,020
markets are traded isn't going to change

1843
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,420
that's never going to change so there's

1844
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,159
no reason for you to worry about oh this

1845
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,320
is a fad it's gonna it's gonna stop

1846
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,580
working because everybody likes to use

1847
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,140
ICT Concepts

1848
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,540
folks this is the market the markets are

1849
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,340
until they do away with the markets

1850
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,440
entirely this is going to continue to

1851
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,659
work so put that aside don't be don't be

1852
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,460
afraid of that stuff you're wasting time

1853
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,380
worrying about things that aren't even a

1854
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,520
factor

1855
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,920
so the 13th of June I said that I want

1856
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,560
to look for and anticipate rather the

1857
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,199
Market's going to go up into that shaded

1858
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,940
area that's the weekly inversion

1859
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,159
Fairbank I've been treat that as a form

1860
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,800
of resistance and then

1861
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,120
gravitate down to

1862
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,300
I said this very candle right there that

1863
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,820
down closed candle I told you it was a

1864
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,620
bullish order block

1865
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,780
it's a change in a state of delivery

1866
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,300
that's what an order block is it's not

1867
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,219
every down closed candle or every

1868
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,659
up-close candle

1869
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:16,920
it's not the things you see people

1870
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,739
talking about on YouTube either

1871
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:21,300
many of the things that people are

1872
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,400
saying about my order block they're

1873
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,320
trying to use supply and demand logic

1874
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,080
and it's flawed

1875
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,060
that that's that's not that's not the

1876
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,159
same thing okay it's not

1877
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,380
I promise you it's not

1878
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,000
what's occurring here is at that candles

1879
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,320
open okay that candles opening price

1880
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,300
was the only

1881
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,679
marker

1882
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:48,719
where price can be measured in this time

1883
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,080
frame where price was offered down

1884
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,780
where was the next down closed candle

1885
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,300
right there

1886
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,600
so between those two down closed candles

1887
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,400
if we're looking for a cell model to

1888
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,960
begin which is what I was outlining on

1889
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,420
the 13th of June

1890
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,380
where could we expect that to form

1891
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,239
the FVG that I shaded and I

1892
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,500
told you on the 13th it's an old weekly

1893
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,020
imbalance so if we leave and in Balance

1894
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,820
what was I teaching you on the weekly

1895
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,440
chart the market can be efficiently

1896
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,600
traded back and forth up and down think

1897
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,580
about that pain analogy when you paint

1898
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,199
your wall are you going to paint up the

1899
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,900
wall and when the paint runs out of a

1900
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,239
supply of paint on that roller you're

1901
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:34,500
just going to leave the areas where the

1902
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,460
paint didn't make it you're just going

1903
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,380
to go to somewhere else on the other

1904
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,060
part of the wall no you're going to roll

1905
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,100
right back over top of it why because

1906
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,960
you want your wall to be efficiently

1907
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,659
painted right well when I look at Price

1908
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:49,020
I'm looking at where price has been

1909
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,780
where it went to recently and was is

1910
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,520
there any pockets of inefficiency in

1911
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,679
there and because I start my analysis on

1912
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,420
the weekly chart why am I starting on

1913
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:59,280
the weekly chart because the whole

1914
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,560
weekly range is going to be

1915
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,380
predicated by what we anticipate on that

1916
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,540
Weekly Candlestick what's it going to do

1917
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:07,920
is it going to go higher or is it going

1918
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,600
to go lower and you only need to

1919
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,760
determine one of two things is going to

1920
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,640
go up for buy stops above an old High

1921
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,140
or it's going to go up to it in

1922
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,580
efficiency which is a FVG

1923
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,679
above market price

1924
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,780
if it's going to go lower it's reaching

1925
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,460
for some inefficiency which is a fair

1926
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,980
value Gap below price which is

1927
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,560
what was being shown here on the weekly

1928
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,880
chart that I did not talk about on the

1929
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,060
13th but I told you this candle is the

1930
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,199
order block I felt it was going to reach

1931
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:36,480
down to

1932
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,659
and I highlighted that range right there

1933
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:42,060
and I mentioned there was

1934
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,980
a likelihood that we would draw down

1935
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,400
into that after we treat this shaded

1936
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,960
area up here

1937
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,239
as resistance

1938
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,239
so we can take this idea

1939
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,000
and dig into the LTFs

1940
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,400
and see if there is any

1941
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,500
signatures that we can look at a lower

1942
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,880
time frame we'll look at an hourly chart

1943
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,120
now

1944
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:08,300
oh right away look at that

1945
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,679
so if you look at what we've done here's

1946
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:12,540
the 13th okay so the Mark wasn't me

1947
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,040
moving around in here I said I want to

1948
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,760
see price show willingness to treat this

1949
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,500
this Gap here let me go up one more time

1950
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,840
because I want to make sure you're

1951
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,120
following along in this little area

1952
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,040
right here

1953
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,719
okay I'm gonna just draw one more

1954
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:28,920
rectangle because that way you can see

1955
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,780
is our frame of reference

1956
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:33,360
this high

1957
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,520
down to present Market

1958
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,500
right there okay

1959
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,320
that shaded area here is this Camp

1960
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,199
underneath my cursor that day which is

1961
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,560
the 12th from the 12th and then the 13th

1962
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,659
is when I gave you the analysis okay I

1963
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:50,340
told you it's the live stream it was not

1964
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,440
a pre-recorded video I told you I want

1965
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,679
to see it treat that Weekly inversion

1966
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:56,940
fair value you got which is this one

1967
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,460
here which is anchored on a weekly

1968
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,659
Candlestick chart right now we're

1969
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,400
looking at a daily chart you can track

1970
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,679
that by looking up here so the 1D is a

1971
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:05,699
daily

1972
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:08,219
so in this range here

1973
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:12,600
in my mind I was seeing this delivery of

1974
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,480
price this is what I'm anticipating this

1975
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,199
is what I'm predicting I'm not reacting

1976
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,880
to price

1977
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,520
okay I see this forming and I'm

1978
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,320
articulating that

1979
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,580
in the live stream of June 13th 2023

1980
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:32,340
so because I have this range now shaded

1981
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,179
when we drop down to the 60 Minute chart

1982
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:38,760
inside this area here

1983
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,440
and I'm going to scrub that little

1984
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,480
rectangle over

1985
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,640
to the 13th and that would be the

1986
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,060
perspective

1987
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,460
okay so what we're looking for is in

1988
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,140
this area here

1989
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:57,179
did

1990
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,400
true or false folks okay

1991
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,400
you're you're judging me now I put out

1992
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,080
my expectation

1993
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,980
I anticipated in this time here before

1994
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,140
we closed the week I said later in the

1995
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,239
week going into Thursday and Friday I

1996
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,060
believe and I say this in the 13th live

1997
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,800
stream for the dollar Index I believe

1998
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,159
that we will likely draw down into this

1999
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,540
order block which is that level right

2000
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,719
there 102.705

2001
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:28,739
right there so I'm going to take this

2002
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,600
box off here so now we can see that this

2003
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,920
is where we're looking at

2004
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,380
did it use

2005
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,760
whether you believe there's an algorithm

2006
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,739
or not okay

2007
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:42,179
did price use this shaded area as it

2008
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:45,600
means to dig into go up into

2009
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,780
and then repel it lower

2010
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,100
I mean I think there's sufficient

2011
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,080
evidence to suggest that what I was

2012
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,600
outlining and anticipating price is

2013
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,760
doing that is it not

2014
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,500
it did it here

2015
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,719
what time of day is that

2016
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,520
look at the bottom chart

2017
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,940
that's Wednesday June 14th 2 A.M what

2018
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,580
time of day is that in terms of ICT kill

2019
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,719
zones

2020
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:12,360
that is the London open Kill Zone

2021
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,100
that's two o'clock in the morning to

2022
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,179
five o'clock in the morning New York

2023
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:18,179
local time every single time you look at

2024
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:21,120
your time references it's always in New

2025
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,040
York local time I don't care where you

2026
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,140
live there's no disrespect to you or

2027
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,340
where you're at

2028
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,280
but the algorithm runs on New York time

2029
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,400
the day the trading day is not defined

2030
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,860
by Wellington New Zealand okay I don't

2031
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,739
know where this idea came from but it's

2032
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:40,560
it's straight up New York local time

2033
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,960
that's the way it is okay so everything

2034
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,620
runs on that and if you keep your time

2035
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,140
relative to New York and when you're

2036
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,820
trading view set up here you can see

2037
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,520
it's always set to New York

2038
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,040
if you do that you'll know when to

2039
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,940
anticipate when to anticipate when do

2040
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,880
these moves form when do they begin

2041
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,679
where do the highs and the lows of the

2042
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:06,719
sessions begin and end

2043
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,880
within those time winners I've given you

2044
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,620
now

2045
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,960
by itself just knowing that the higher

2046
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,140
low of of a market in Forex forms

2047
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,300
in the London session between two

2048
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,260
o'clock and five o'clock in the morning

2049
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,560
that in itself is a huge advantage

2050
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,739
because if you can have a weekly bias

2051
01:19:24,739 --> 01:19:27,420
determining that okay

2052
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,699
you know if we suspect that the dollar

2053
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,199
Index is going to be bearish for the

2054
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,000
week to come

2055
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,580
and forget the economic counter for a

2056
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,239
moment because we're going to get into

2057
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,800
that too

2058
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,140
if we think that the price is likely to

2059
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,179
draw down into these levels here

2060
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:43,800
now I'm going to take that purple shade

2061
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,420
Berry off because that's the

2062
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,340
weekly Fair Aid Gap that I did not

2063
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,840
mention but I didn't need to because I

2064
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,920
took your attention right to that level

2065
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,100
there which is the daily bush

2066
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,260
over block

2067
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,820
a daily bullish order block doesn't

2068
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,800
always mean it's an entry to go long

2069
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,760
it's

2070
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,159
it's a draw on liquidity okay it's a re

2071
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,140
it's a PD array that the market will

2072
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,719
want to reach into obviously you can see

2073
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,340
that that order block did in fact cause

2074
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,679
a nice little run up we're going to go

2075
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,659
up into

2076
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,420
look closely where to go into that same

2077
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,239
shaded area that old weekly fair value

2078
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,159
got the inversion for your bank account

2079
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,440
the mentioning of it being used as what

2080
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,780
resistance so in here we're talking

2081
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,520
about it it's likely to go up we're

2082
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,140
going to see it treated as resistance

2083
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,719
does it yes

2084
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,280
does it go down to the level I talked

2085
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,560
about on the 13th as a draw on liquidity

2086
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,260
or Target yes then what does it do it

2087
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,840
repels price higher again

2088
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,420
and goes into what

2089
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,739
look at these three up close candles

2090
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:45,960
right in here

2091
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,460
see all that

2092
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,440
listen close

2093
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,679
ICT why do you use the last candle on

2094
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:53,820
some

2095
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,400
examples and other times you use the

2096
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,580
consecutive candles well

2097
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,580
all of these are inside of this fair

2098
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,380
value Gap that shaded area which is an

2099
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,659
old weekly fair value

2100
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:08,400
if they're consecutive like this and

2101
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,320
they're inside that range I'm going to

2102
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,300
use the entirety of all that because the

2103
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,100
beginning of this

2104
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,140
opening on this candle here in the next

2105
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,000
candle the next candle that's all one

2106
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,219
PD for BS it's

2107
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:22,440
delivering BS delivery so that

2108
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,840
means there's movement up

2109
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,120
so I want to refer back to that opening

2110
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,219
price right there because that starts

2111
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:30,659
the order block and the mean threshold

2112
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,040
would be the middle

2113
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,860
of the low of this candle to the high of

2114
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:38,600
that one and that would look like this

2115
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,460
so we have the low of this candle up to

2116
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,540
the high

2117
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,659
mean threshold is

2118
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:56,460
103.324 okay so we allow listen folks we

2119
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,719
allow for price to trade to and through

2120
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,460
but not close listen not close

2121
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,400
above mean threshold

2122
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,360
so the Wicks due to damage the bodies

2123
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,400
tell you the story

2124
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,100
look what's going on over here

2125
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,659
see all that we'll get to that in a

2126
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:21,420
second opening price

2127
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,500
let me drop this here

2128
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,620
it hits differently when you know I've

2129
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,560
already talked about beforehand huh

2130
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,659
oh man I can't use a cherry picking

2131
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:36,420
analogy on it now

2132
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,920
so here's mean threshold so that's what

2133
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,199
I'm identifying here but this level

2134
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,659
that opening price

2135
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,460
there

2136
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,380
that is the change in the state of

2137
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,640
delivery

2138
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,540
meaning on the 13th of June I stated

2139
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:01,560
that I want to see you want to study

2140
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,260
if I have any validity Behind these

2141
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,540
things if it's not going to hold up if

2142
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,739
it doesn't react the way I'm talking

2143
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,719
about in the future then there is no

2144
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:11,280
algorithm that means that I'm a fraud

2145
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,659
that means that there's none of none of

2146
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:13,679
these things should be even studied

2147
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,000
because it's all

2148
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,719
hindsight okay so what I do is I tell

2149
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,760
you in the analysis where I think price

2150
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,100
is going to gravitate to and then you as

2151
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,840
the student you go back through price

2152
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,940
action and you look for what PD array

2153
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,199
you like

2154
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:30,659
what does that mean

2155
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:34,219
what's what's that mean

2156
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:36,480
what do you use for your setup what's

2157
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,120
your multiplier is it the optimal trade

2158
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,159
entry is that what you is that what you

2159
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:42,900
use to get into a trade do you use a

2160
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,300
FVG now do you use the 2022

2161
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,300
model as your as your trade do you use

2162
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,580
Breakers

2163
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,460
it depends on what you feel comfortable

2164
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,960
trading there is no listen there is no

2165
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,080
better PD array than another one

2166
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,320
because not every single price run will

2167
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,179
have every single one of my PD arrays in

2168
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:08,460
it not every single price move

2169
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,100
that I'm trading has a breaker in it not

2170
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,420
every single one of the trades I'm

2171
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,659
entering is using a FVG not

2172
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,280
all of them are an older order block

2173
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,580
entry not all of them well when's it

2174
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,900
when's the last time you see me talk

2175
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,940
about optimal trade injury but you

2176
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,679
probably still trade them right

2177
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,739
I'm teaching you a wide spectrum of

2178
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:31,380
opportunities for you as the trader to

2179
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,600
gravitate to whichever one makes the

2180
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,580
most sense to you all of them are

2181
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,260
equally profitable

2182
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,719
all of them are equally capable of

2183
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:43,380
blowing your account if you misuse them

2184
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:47,219
so I'm a I'm a realist

2185
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:50,219
I have 81 ways to get into a Marketplace

2186
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:53,219
you don't need but just one

2187
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:55,380
you just need one and whatever that one

2188
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,540
is you stick with it until you get

2189
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,040
really really good with it and once you

2190
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,320
find consistency with it if you want to

2191
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,940
graduate into something else and Dabble

2192
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,380
into you know trying to build another

2193
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,000
model in addition to the one you find

2194
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,280
consistency and profitability in you

2195
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,679
know have at it but don't try to apply

2196
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:12,900
all of them that's what everybody does

2197
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,820
wrong when they come to my content they

2198
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,219
try to apply everything to every single

2199
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:18,900
Market condition and that's not what I'm

2200
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,699
teaching you to do

2201
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,320
now if you go to Tom Dick and Harry

2202
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,900
Styles menu mentorship where they take

2203
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,699
my stuff Rebrand it and try to condense

2204
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,980
it down into a five minute trainer video

2205
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,659
you know that's that's the perspective

2206
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:31,860
you're going to get you're going to get

2207
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,140
like you know watered-down approach to

2208
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,940
what it is I'm teaching and you're not

2209
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,800
going to come to the real understanding

2210
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,199
of what it is that's available to you

2211
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:42,900
these consecutive up close candles is

2212
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,400
one

2213
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,780
order block

2214
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:49,199
meaning that inside this shaded area

2215
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,420
right before this Market changed and

2216
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,760
went lower my eye goes right to that

2217
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,400
opening price because I'm using all

2218
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,860
three of these candlesticks because it's

2219
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,360
inside of a range I've already told you

2220
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,760
on the 13th we want to treat that range

2221
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,280
as a inversion fair value in other words

2222
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,280
it's an area where the algorithm will go

2223
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,360
up

2224
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,239
spend some time in there allowing smart

2225
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,580
Money traders that will see what I'm

2226
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,800
teaching you that isn't in books

2227
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,420
they're using this frame of reference

2228
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,239
because they want to sell short here and

2229
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:22,739
buy at a lower price down where the

2230
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:25,320
order block is here

2231
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,920
an order block is not orders

2232
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,679
you can't see an order block the way I'm

2233
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,239
telling you you can't see that on level

2234
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:34,920
two there's people that say oh you know

2235
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,239
level it's not level two it has nothing

2236
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,580
to do with the orders has nothing to do

2237
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,659
with it

2238
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:43,560
nothing okay so stop the

2239
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,960
it's where the market changes its data

2240
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,120
delivery meaning that inside this shaded

2241
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,820
area we want to see the price go up into

2242
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,760
does it do it yes and then once this

2243
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,560
candles opening price that is the

2244
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,000
beginning of these three consecutive

2245
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,560
candles and I'm using all three because

2246
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,420
it's inside the area I told you to

2247
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,940
Define as a reason to anticipate price

2248
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,040
going lower from the beginning right

2249
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,040
on the 13th of June I said we want to

2250
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,900
see signatures that means

2251
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,360
evidence in PD in price

2252
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,060
action itself does price show a

2253
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,699
willingness to treat this shaded area as

2254
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,800
resistance

2255
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,320
does it want to send price lower when it

2256
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,780
enters into it where

2257
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,900
the low midpoint consequent encroachment

2258
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,659
and the high we don't

2259
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:34,860
listen we don't want to see the high end

2260
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:37,440
of a old FVG if it's being

2261
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,940
treated as an inversion FVG

2262
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:42,179
the better setups form if the high if

2263
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:44,040
you're looking at it as a resistance or

2264
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,620
using it as a beginning point or

2265
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:49,620
Inception of a SS delivery or

2266
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,139
cell program

2267
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,840
we don't want to see the high traded to

2268
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,480
treat that like the same thing I treat a

2269
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,820
breakaway gap which is a FVG

2270
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,880
that won't completely fill in

2271
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,100
if it gives you that signature which is

2272
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,719
what we're seeing here as soon as price

2273
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,820
breaks below the opening price here and

2274
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,639
leaves the Shaded area that's in like a

2275
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:12,840
pale Orange

2276
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,300
once it does that that qualifies that

2277
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,540
right there as a bearish order block

2278
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,480
why because the state of delivery

2279
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,139
changes from BS delivery

2280
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:27,179
then it crosses over the opening price

2281
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:30,600
there just because it crossed below an

2282
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,760
opening price of a series of up close

2283
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,940
candles doesn't make it an order block

2284
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,460
The Narrative behind where that order

2285
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,139
block resides

2286
01:28:40,139 --> 01:28:43,139
that is the imperative point that

2287
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:45,360
everybody is missing

2288
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,219
that's why everybody has books and

2289
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:48,600
 out there they want to call

2290
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,639
mentorships and courses talking about is

2291
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,980
an order block you have no I you're

2292
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,840
making up

2293
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,580
you're making it up as you go you're on

2294
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,960
the Fly you're looking at something in

2295
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,280
hindsight trying to explain something

2296
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,840
in this shaded area this is what I I

2297
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,360
told you to look at it on the 13th and

2298
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,699
then we look for signatures inside that

2299
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:10,320
range

2300
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,420
what does that mean well you have an

2301
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,679
order block here

2302
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,679
you also have a breaker

2303
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:20,940
what mm-hmm there's a breaker there

2304
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,420
high low higher high

2305
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,580
consecutive down closed candles same

2306
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,560
thing we're applying here all these

2307
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,659
ranges here Push It Forward in time

2308
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:33,719
you're getting the same entry here

2309
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:35,760
stop above here

2310
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,980
we're not trading the dollar Index but

2311
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,840
I'm trying to tell you that

2312
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,600
you can pick your own model and every

2313
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,739
one of you can be trading differently

2314
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:45,179
using what I've taught and you're all

2315
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,580
can find profitability you don't need

2316
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:50,280
the same entries the entries are the

2317
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,199
least important thing

2318
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,120
I'm going to say it again

2319
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,780
where you enter is the least important

2320
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:00,239
factor in consistency it is the least

2321
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,040
important thing

2322
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,460
you have to know this

2323
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,800
where is it going

2324
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,980
because if you can determine

2325
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,260
where it's likely to go to what is what

2326
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,699
I've outlined here in this beginning of

2327
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,659
this presentation today

2328
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,900
you can find a myriad of entry points

2329
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,020
when price returned back up into

2330
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,239
this low here right there you can be

2331
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,480
short

2332
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,719
what would you anticipate

2333
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,100
this rejection block which is the lowest

2334
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,239
down close

2335
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,100
that's your first draw

2336
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,320
below it SS

2337
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,060
and then you can start doing projections

2338
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,400
on all this price around here lower to

2339
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,620
see if it wants to dig in lower

2340
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,800
it's Friday it's already hit the mark

2341
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,360
here

2342
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,400
did I out outline the card before on the

2343
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,840
13th of June

2344
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,420
you can use this as an entry going short

2345
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,340
well look at this look it did Michael it

2346
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,320
ran up here yeah I know but you're

2347
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,760
trading with a higher time premise

2348
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,460
meaning you're entering here where's the

2349
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,199
model call for for stop loss it's got to

2350
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:12,800
be above that high

2351
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,060
if you're using the last up close candle

2352
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,040
the same thing you don't get short here

2353
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,840
but you can be short here the stops got

2354
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,639
to be above here

2355
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,560
we're not using the dollar Index as a

2356
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,179
tradable vehicle

2357
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:26,639
I'm just teaching the logic that you're

2358
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,139
applying to whatever Market you're

2359
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:29,219
Trading

2360
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:30,960
whether you're trading the breaker which

2361
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,080
would have been a fill here or here

2362
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,960
price alone

2363
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,020
price alone those as that's the

2364
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,940
instances where price returned to the PD

2365
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,159
array now here is where you separate the

2366
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:45,840
men from the boys and the lions from the

2367
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,400
Sheep

2368
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,560
time

2369
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,260
just because price went up to that level

2370
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,639
right there

2371
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,760
at two o'clock in the afternoon are you

2372
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,820
factoring a great deal of emphasis on a

2373
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:03,300
late afternoon dollar

2374
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,699
no

2375
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:07,679
you want to focus on the relationships

2376
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,780
of what the dollars doing during key

2377
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,280
kill zones

2378
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,620
dollar is going to be highly sensitive

2379
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,360
to Forex

2380
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,800
s p NASDAQ Dao it will use the longer

2381
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,100
term higher time draw of risk on risk

2382
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,420
off with a dollar but sometimes

2383
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,219
sometimes this is where it makes a

2384
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:29,280
little bit difficult for some of you

2385
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,699
the index can Flex against that

2386
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,639
that you don't see that with Euro and

2387
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:36,719
cable

2388
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,940
unless dollars being manipulated held in

2389
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,920
consolidation which it's not being here

2390
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,780
it's being allowed to move

2391
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,420
gyrate move around that means that your

2392
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,280
Forex pairs can be free to move around

2393
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,620
and have a lot more volatility as well

2394
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,340
so if there's a emphasis on dollar usage

2395
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,380
in your analysis just know that there is

2396
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,940
a much more

2397
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,500
impactful

2398
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,560
driver of price when you're using dollar

2399
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,260
when it comes to currencies

2400
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:05,940
longer term

2401
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,820
yes dollar risk on risk off will

2402
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,980
eventually weigh on

2403
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:14,460
stocks but stocks are also highly

2404
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,600
manipulated right now they shouldn't

2405
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,100
even be at these levels

2406
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,780
none of these companies should be

2407
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,340
trading at these into these multiples

2408
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,920
it's ridiculous but we have to stick

2409
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,600
with what the Market's showing us if we

2410
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,800
were trying to make money we're not

2411
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,800
trying to be predicting the crash okay I

2412
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,060
mean in my opinion the market should

2413
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,800
have crashed dozens of times in the last

2414
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,300
three years it should have

2415
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,719
but it hasn't and even though I know and

2416
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,580
everybody with the common sense knows

2417
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:41,699
that these markets in in stock rather

2418
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:44,219
they they're not justified at the levels

2419
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:45,900
they're trading in

2420
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,699
but are we going to sit around and arm

2421
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:49,679
wrestle which should be taking place

2422
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,320
from a practical sense versus what can

2423
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,239
we take as an opportunity

2424
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,620
because we have to trade with the

2425
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,300
Market's giving us as opportunity and

2426
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,159
that's what I'm teaching you to do focus

2427
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:02,400
on what is available based on time

2428
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,699
now we have the market run up into

2429
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:09,239
during Wednesday at two o'clock what's

2430
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:11,520
going on there

2431
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,040
on Wednesday we had another Market event

2432
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,920
that day big calendar event medium

2433
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,960
impact high impact news drivers

2434
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,659
we can anticipate on that Weekly chart

2435
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:25,280
where the

2436
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,460
the Inception of the majority of

2437
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,860
manipulation will begin based on the

2438
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:33,900
calendar so when we look at an economic

2439
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,000
calendar we're looking at

2440
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,940
a medium medium impact or a high impact

2441
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,580
news driver something that's going to be

2442
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:44,520
many times used as a smoke screen I'm

2443
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,560
not of the opinion I've never really had

2444
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,600
this opinion anyway but I'm not of the

2445
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,400
opinion that because it's a high impact

2446
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,260
news event

2447
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,600
that the Market's moving based on that

2448
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,820
information

2449
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,280
that is sometimes

2450
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,980
in a way you could study this is go back

2451
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,199
through history and look at the the

2452
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,360
releases of the data I'm not a

2453
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,580
fundamental Trader okay I don't I don't

2454
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,440
consider the information that's being

2455
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,360
released at the time I never even refer

2456
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,219
to it I never look at what the numbers

2457
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:16,139
were I've done it in the past when I was

2458
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:18,000
teaching mentorship just to prove to

2459
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,580
them that sometimes the the data will

2460
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,100
come out and from a classical

2461
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:26,100
perspective the data may be perceived as

2462
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,960
good or bad

2463
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,239
and if it's suggested in historical

2464
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,219
terms that whatever data that came out

2465
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:33,480
if it's

2466
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,120
beneficiary or a positive for that

2467
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,340
currency or that market but then how

2468
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,500
many times has the market rejected that

2469
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,940
and traded down and then they come back

2470
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,620
after the fact say well the market

2471
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,300
already priced that in you weren't

2472
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,760
telling us that they already factored in

2473
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,100
that and priced it in it's just an

2474
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,900
excuse because these things are being

2475
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:55,139
used as a smoke screen so I just use a

2476
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:56,699
high impact or a medium impact news

2477
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,699
driver on economic calendar it's a Time

2478
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:01,920
just like a TV Guide you know when time

2479
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,360
the the game is going to come on right

2480
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,340
you go on there and you look on your TV

2481
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,800
and say okay the the Knicks are

2482
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,600
playing today at this time or tonight at

2483
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,159
that time you know the Super Bowl begins

2484
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:13,380
at this time on this channel the markets

2485
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:15,719
are delivering price the same way

2486
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:18,600
I know it sounds crazy I know but that's

2487
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,239
how I'm accurate I'm following the

2488
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:22,920
schedule of when price is likely to move

2489
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,199
and you can time when these Market moves

2490
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,580
are going to occur to something looking

2491
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,820
at the economic calendar and blending in

2492
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,560
the key times of the day I've told you

2493
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,540
to focus on

2494
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:36,300
all New York local time

2495
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,900
so

2496
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,360
two o'clock on Wednesday

2497
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,620
where are we at here on Thursday what

2498
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:49,340
time of day is this

2499
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,380
London open

2500
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,540
London open

2501
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,940
typically forms what what did I teach if

2502
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,080
you've been with me for a long time

2503
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,940
between two o'clock and five o'clock in

2504
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,800
the morning New York local time London

2505
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,840
generally

2506
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,120
70 of the time and for the folks that

2507
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,320
like to do these little number crunches

2508
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,639
I have people in the past say well

2509
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:12,719
that's I went through the

2510
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:13,980
number you're looking at every single

2511
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:17,040
week you have to look at when the bias

2512
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,659
is suggested that we're going to

2513
01:37:18,659 --> 01:37:22,260
entering a a sell-off okay if we're in a

2514
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,840
position and I've told you on the 13th

2515
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,280
this week

2516
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,960
I said that dollar is going to go here

2517
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,400
we went there

2518
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,139
now your question is you're like well

2519
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,000
how would you know that it wouldn't just

2520
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,199
reverse here and treat that as a

2521
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:38,460
long-term little shorter block I know I

2522
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,020
just read your mind right

2523
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,580
you just drop your potato chips thing

2524
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,199
longer term perspective

2525
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:48,900
we've already spent time reaching into

2526
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,400
premiums on that Weekly chart for the

2527
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,280
dollar we met multiple premium arrays as

2528
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,840
Targets on the upside

2529
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,280
and

2530
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,520
we've worked all of any inefficiencies

2531
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,659
out

2532
01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:04,020
and now we've worked into the discount

2533
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,260
arrays so it's reasonable to anticipate

2534
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,600
that the dollar wants to go lower we

2535
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,340
still have time it's Friday

2536
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,500
and everybody that sees this low here

2537
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,360
that went long

2538
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,940
they're trying to catch the bottom

2539
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,199
and that's why you're seeing what we're

2540
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,880
seeing here

2541
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,460
we traded down into this low deeper into

2542
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,960
the order block

2543
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,400
what order block let's go back out to

2544
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,120
the Daily for a second

2545
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:32,340
this entire down close candle here

2546
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:35,760
that range is the order block if we're a

2547
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,560
bearish we want to see it trade

2548
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,540
initially into the open of it because

2549
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,560
that's this change in the state of

2550
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,600
delivery and then we want to see it try

2551
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,699
to reach for the mean threshold how we

2552
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:45,900
know if it's going to continue going

2553
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,600
lower is how we close after hitting mean

2554
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,980
threshold

2555
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,440
that's part of order block Theory

2556
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,719
if it closes below the mean threshold

2557
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,940
chances are we're likely to see it one

2558
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,679
it continues going lower

2559
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:01,380
if it were to go lower we have a small

2560
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,120
little portion of this Gap that's being

2561
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,380
shown from this candle's High

2562
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,040
and that candle is low

2563
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,040
looks like that

2564
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,500
so that little Gap right there that's a

2565
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,179
small little area that's still exposed

2566
01:39:18,179 --> 01:39:20,520
so if we were to close

2567
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,380
below this

2568
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,480
middle of this candle which I'm

2569
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,800
highlighting here that's the little

2570
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,000
shoulder block

2571
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,020
wait a minute you're calling it a

2572
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:28,980
bullish order block and you're calling

2573
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,600
it right

2574
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,580
when it was up here

2575
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,739
earlier in the week it was a discount

2576
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:37,320
array but it's classified as a bullish

2577
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,600
order block again bullish order blocks

2578
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,400
are not always buying opportunities

2579
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,440
they're targets and it also means of

2580
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,020
measuring order flow if we close below

2581
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,699
the mean threshold half of that candle's

2582
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:50,280
body if it closes below that it is

2583
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,139
indicating that it might want to still

2584
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:54,540
keep going lower into next week

2585
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:57,659
if it does where would it reach for

2586
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,300
SS below this candle is low

2587
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,820
let me move it out of the way I'm sorry

2588
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,920
below that candle is low and into that

2589
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,960
small little inefficiency and if it

2590
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,420
accelerates we have another fear they

2591
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,620
got right here

2592
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,480
the candle I'm pointing to

2593
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,060
is a FVG in the form of a buy

2594
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,380
side and balanced cell sign efficiency

2595
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,060
look at the candle to the left of the

2596
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,440
one I'm highlighting here

2597
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,199
that candle is high to the left and the

2598
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:25,080
candles low to the right that makes this

2599
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,219
a fair bank account

2600
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:31,020
I don't know what we're going to do over

2601
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,159
the weekend

2602
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,780
this is why I don't I don't trade on the

2603
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,340
weekend I used to trade over the weekend

2604
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,900
like the whole positions over but

2605
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,699
because of the Gap risk

2606
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:42,120
what does that mean where we close on

2607
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:45,260
Fridays and where we open up on Sunday

2608
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:48,000
can be dramatic now because of all the

2609
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,199
things that's been going on over the

2610
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,159
last three years and we're not going to

2611
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,560
talk about all these topics but the

2612
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,179
nonsense that's been going on all around

2613
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:56,400
the world you know all the geopolitical

2614
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,139
things and

2615
01:40:58,139 --> 01:41:00,239
Health and Welfare issues that

2616
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,639
everyone's having to deal with they have

2617
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,900
caused a great deal of Gap risk so most

2618
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,540
of your trading in my opinion should be

2619
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,179
settled intraday

2620
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:14,699
unless you're really you know

2621
01:41:14,699 --> 01:41:17,040
comfortable with gap risk even the

2622
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,500
restart is at 6 PM when there's a lull

2623
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,139
in trading you know for five o'clock to

2624
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:23,100
six o'clock if you're trading stock

2625
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,500
indices sometimes those gaps can be a

2626
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,020
little bit jarring and it can be a

2627
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:29,280
little bit more than you anticipated

2628
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,159
sometimes it's in positive but sometimes

2629
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,219
can be a negative so I think if there's

2630
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:36,960
ever been a time in history where

2631
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,820
Traders should be primarily focused on

2632
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,020
day trading

2633
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:42,540
we're in it this is the this is the

2634
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,940
climate for that to be sleeping

2635
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,619
soundly at night

2636
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:49,500
so anyway I covered a lot here and I'm

2637
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,239
going to go LTFd we're

2638
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:52,860
going to go to a 15 minute Candlestick

2639
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,760
chart

2640
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,199
and we're going to take a 10 minute

2641
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,600
pause here so right now at the time it's

2642
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,520
9 53 I want a little bit longer than the

2643
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,500
hour I apologize but that's typical ICT

2644
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,600
and obviously we've delivered

2645
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,460
let's come back exactly at 10 o'clock

2646
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,980
it's not quite 10 minutes but let's

2647
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,960
take a break you can go relieve yourself

2648
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,300
refresh your drinks and

2649
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,040
go tell your wife and husband that

2650
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,300
you're learning something you can't wait

2651
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,580
to get back to it so I'll see you in a

2652
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,760
few minutes

2653
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:31,539
[Music]

2654
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,880
okay

2655
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:39,220
[Music]

2656
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,780
foreign

2657

all right folks

2658
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:39,360
I'm checking Twitter

2659
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,340
before I start talking I want to make

2660
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,960
sure that you can hear me we've taken

2661
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,940
a couple minutes break

2662
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,860
you guys can hear me this could be a 5x5

2663
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:49,940
that audio is back

2664
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:58,380
again just checking to see if Twitter

2665
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:02,060
can confirm you can hear me

2666
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,400
thank you Emmanuel

2667
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,139
thank you folks appreciate that

2668
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:12,239
all right so

2669
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:14,219
usually

2670
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:16,980
I like to ask you all the

2671
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:19,440
give it a thumbs up and such but um if

2672
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,940
you like what you're learning here today

2673
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,340
and we're not even close to being done

2674
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,920
um just give this a like it doesn't cost

2675
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,179
you anything to do it just a little

2676
01:49:27,179 --> 01:49:28,920
quick little thumb you're going to want

2677
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,900
to use this as a marker to go into your

2678
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,119
liked videos to find this one

2679
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,739
it promises a whole lot of stuff in here

2680
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:36,060
you're going to enjoy

2681
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:37,380
all right so

2682
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,960
back to discussion we have just made our

2683
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,880
way into the 15-minute Candlestick chart

2684
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:44,159
for the dollar Index so obviously I'm

2685
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,280
taking you through a very detailed

2686
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:49,260
top-down analysis of what it is that you

2687
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:50,400
look for

2688
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,440
whenever I talk about

2689
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,119
where I think the Market's going to draw

2690
01:49:54,119 --> 01:49:55,139
to

2691
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,780
that's my experience in three decades of

2692
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,159
knowing

2693
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,920
what I've seen over the years with the

2694
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,360
algorithm is likely to be doing unless

2695
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,580
manual intervention steps in these are

2696
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:07,440
the things that we expect to see and

2697
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,239
that's what makes what I teach and what

2698
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:11,760
I share and what I call it in advance

2699
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,880
um so accurate a lot of people that have

2700
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,320
odds against me because they're running

2701
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,940
a service paying you know paid service

2702
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:20,119
something they're selling or whatever

2703
01:50:20,119 --> 01:50:22,500
they'll say what I do is easy anybody

2704
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,940
can do it but they're not nowhere

2705
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,980
anywhere near is accurate they don't

2706
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:28,500
call the levels to the degree they don't

2707
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,820
have the experience I'm sharing with you

2708
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:35,699
and all I'm saying is

2709
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:37,800
if you listen to other people

2710
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,320
and you haven't spent time here seeing

2711
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,520
what it is that's being shared and

2712
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,679
taught you really aren't making an

2713
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,179
informed decision you're just using

2714
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:47,520
someone else's opinion and that's that's

2715
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,639
the the mistake or

2716
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,639
um

2717
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:56,460
I guess trap of social media so with

2718
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,659
that said let's get into the

2719
01:50:57,659 --> 01:50:59,520
nitty-gritty here

2720
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,960
all right so we have the dollar Index on

2721
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,639
the 15-minute time frame we've been

2722
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,440
talking about this weekly inefficiency

2723
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,540
that was a weekly inversion fair value

2724
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:09,560
Gap I stated on the 13th of June 2023

2725
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:12,420
that we would look for signatures that

2726
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,540
this is being

2727
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:19,560
utilized by the algorithm for resistance

2728
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,719
now when we look at

2729
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,320
the dollar for Forex Traders you're

2730
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,840
really going to be focusing on like the

2731
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,699
London open Kill Zone the New York open

2732
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:31,619
Killzone and again for the London open

2733
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:35,219
Kill Zone it's all New York local time

2734
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:37,199
it begins at 2 A.M

2735
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:40,500
and ends at 5am now

2736
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,480
I personally

2737
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,860
personally I use 1am as a buffer and to

2738
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,900
me that kind of like cancels out any

2739
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,820
tomfoolery that would occur because of

2740
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,800
daylight savings time which I wish they

2741
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,020
would abolish it I mean it was the

2742
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,000
stupidest thing to implement anyway in

2743
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,380
some parts of the world don't even use

2744
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:02,400
daylight savings time but to remove all

2745
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,820
the the uncertainty about time I've

2746
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:10,260
always used my personal is 1am to 5 A.M

2747
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:13,500
okay that's the time so that means any

2748
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,260
setup that I like to look for can occur

2749
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:18,840
that early which is kind of like the the

2750
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,580
European open

2751
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,199
and then you have at two o'clock it's

2752
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,300
the

2753
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:27,060
London open but two and it usually

2754
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,300
closes up shop in the volume Peters off

2755
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,659
at 5am and in between five o'clock in

2756
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:35,219
the morning to seven o'clock in the

2757
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:37,199
morning I refer to that as dead time

2758
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,659
don't don't try to do too much anything

2759
01:52:39,659 --> 01:52:42,300
in here but I have taken trades as early

2760
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,520
as six o'clock in the morning trading

2761
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,020
the New York session over to New York

2762
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:48,000
open Killzone which is classically

2763
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,260
defined by

2764
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,900
seven o'clock in the morning to 10

2765
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,760
o'clock in the morning and

2766
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,619
you can look at seven o'clock to nine

2767
01:52:55,619 --> 01:52:58,139
o'clock as that little sweet spot where

2768
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:00,239
the majority of your trades are going to

2769
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,000
form buy or sell for Forex Trading

2770
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,199
between seven o'clock in the morning and

2771
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:05,760
nine o'clock in the morning

2772
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,400
the London open

2773
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,500
I I talked about this moments before we

2774
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:13,219
took our first break

2775
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,659
at seven o'clock I'm sorry at one open

2776
01:53:15,659 --> 01:53:17,760
at two o'clock in the morning

2777
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,100
and five o'clock in the morning New York

2778
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,300
local time

2779
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,639
that is the ICT

2780
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:27,420
loan open Kill Zone that if you know

2781
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,580
where the weekly Candlestick is likely

2782
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,719
to draw to

2783
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,340
everything I've been talking about up to

2784
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:37,619
this point is how I do it there is no

2785
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:40,139
shortcut version of it it says the

2786
01:53:40,139 --> 01:53:42,360
Market's going to go up to a gap

2787
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,699
or it's going to go up to Old High

2788
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:46,739
if it's going to go up if it's going to

2789
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:48,840
go down it's going to go down to a gap

2790
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,000
below price or go below an old low

2791
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,420
that's it how you define which one it is

2792
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:56,580
is what is it done recently

2793
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,100
how has it traded is it leaving a range

2794
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:01,139
that we've worked multiple times back

2795
01:54:01,139 --> 01:54:02,159
and forth

2796
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:04,199
and it's been efficiently delivered and

2797
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:05,760
we left that range chances are it's

2798
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,980
probably going to expand lower reaching

2799
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:10,800
for an old low or inefficiency in the

2800
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,360
form of a fair Gap FVG below

2801
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,139
price

2802
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:17,280
or reverse it it's it's that simple and

2803
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,500
what you're wrestling with is you're

2804
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,119
trying to bring other things that you

2805
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,639
either know you learn from somebody else

2806
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:26,340
some kind of other indicator based idea

2807
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,560
or retail perspective maybe supplying

2808
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,960
demand maybe harmonic stuff you're

2809
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,360
trying to bring that into this and see

2810
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,000
where you know you can help your

2811
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,619
understanding by bringing that in then

2812
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:39,840
that's the mistake leave all that stuff

2813
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,280
at the door

2814
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,900
like what I'm teaching is not

2815
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:45,239
complicated it's either going up or it's

2816
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:47,699
going down for one of two reasons

2817
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:49,560
and if you spend the time on the weekly

2818
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,420
chart to Define that you can come away

2819
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,340
with what I've shared many times for

2820
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:54,179
years

2821
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:56,460
in the witness of hundreds of thousands

2822
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:57,540
of people

2823
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:59,159
and they're watching it pan out and

2824
01:54:59,159 --> 01:55:00,480
you're if you're new you're now just

2825
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,020
discovering that and I envy you because

2826
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:05,880
I I know what it was like when I first

2827
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,000
discovered it it's it's crazy it

2828
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,340
literally is mind-boggling to see how

2829
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,139
much precision and everything is

2830
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:15,119
scheduled but like every price run that

2831
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,860
you see in PA is not a

2832
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:17,699
surprise

2833
01:55:17,699 --> 01:55:20,639
unless it's a a wartime event or some

2834
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,860
kind of you know

2835
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:25,199
event that would be

2836
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,960
destructive we'll say it like that

2837
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:30,179
or a manual intervention come in like a

2838
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:34,500
surprise rate announcement it's happened

2839
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,900
those things I'm not prepared for

2840
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:39,840
that and that because of that it incurs

2841
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,820
risk and that's why you have to always

2842
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:43,260
understand that

2843
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,060
as good as my stuff is and as good as

2844
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:46,980
anybody else's stuff might be you know I

2845
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,480
mean people can show profitability and

2846
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,340
show statements and show live streams

2847
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,380
and they can do this and do that it does

2848
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:55,100
not change the fact that any one of us

2849
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,960
me somebody else that's teaching selling

2850
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,900
courses or whatever any one of us can be

2851
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,980
a victim

2852
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:05,340
of some unexpected event that can

2853
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:06,840
completely

2854
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,360
take everybody's best surprise

2855
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,219
and I use the analogy many times with

2856
01:56:11,219 --> 01:56:13,080
the deepegging of Euro in the Swiss

2857
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,860
franc

2858
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:16,619
where brokerage firms immediately were

2859
01:56:16,619 --> 01:56:19,380
made insolvent

2860
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,420
and people lost their money they lost

2861
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:24,179
money billions and billions of dollars

2862
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:25,860
were lost that day

2863
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:28,020
because of that de-pegging between the

2864
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,580
Euro and the swissy

2865
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:30,900
so

2866
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:33,360
did anybody see that coming you know did

2867
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,280
did anybody warn you in advance about

2868
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,920
that stuff chances are probably not

2869
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,679
so that's real risk and all of these

2870
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:43,739
markets have that kind of risk so is it

2871
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:45,300
something mindful of yes is it something

2872
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,460
that paralyzed you and never you know

2873
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,320
allow you to go in and trade well that's

2874
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,020
up for you you do the side okay I don't

2875
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,340
tell people to trade with live money

2876
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,320
you'll determine when you're comfortable

2877
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:58,020
doing that I don't ever sit down and say

2878
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:00,239
you're ready to do it now but I know the

2879
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:01,739
ones that aren't

2880
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:03,300
so if you look at the range here we're

2881
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:06,020
going to measure the high

2882
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,580
I'm trying to find a point where I can

2883
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:11,040
lay it on the boat okay so we can see

2884
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,800
that the highest point here

2885
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,960
and it might not be the very

2886
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:18,300
pipette and I could care less about that

2887
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,639
but the low and the high I've dropped

2888
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,199
the Fibonacci on that

2889
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:23,760
and the only thing I'm using the

2890
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,400
Fibonacci for is to show you the

2891
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,199
relationship of the three specific price

2892
01:57:28,199 --> 01:57:30,000
levels that I teach my students to look

2893
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,199
at

2894
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:34,500
so if we're looking at the High

2895
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,300
okay I'm trying to see what that note is

2896
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:38,420
here

2897
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:43,739
okay one zero three point four four five

2898
01:57:43,739 --> 01:57:46,460
the low

2899
01:57:48,619 --> 01:57:52,679
103.226 okay they may or may not be the

2900
01:57:52,679 --> 01:57:53,880
actual high and low of the weekly

2901
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,739
candles that are used to define that

2902
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:57,599
range but I think this is close enough

2903
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,840
for government work so the midpoint is

2904
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,719
one zero three point three three six

2905
01:58:03,719 --> 01:58:06,719
the midpoint of any Gap that being a

2906
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,480
FVG or a real liquidity a

2907
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,980
liquidity boy would be like this little

2908
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:13,560
area right there see there's no there's

2909
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,260
no overlapping of any Wick or candle

2910
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:18,420
body is it opened here

2911
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,300
and it closed here there's no price data

2912
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,739
here at all that's a real liquidity

2913
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:24,659
board that's a real Gap

2914
01:58:24,659 --> 01:58:28,500
we refer to things like this here

2915
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,659
as a fair value guy and this would be in

2916
01:58:30,659 --> 01:58:32,040
the form of a buy-sided male and cell

2917
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,300
sign efficiency

2918
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,940
this is a real liquidity boy

2919
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:37,500
any Gap

2920
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,199
whether it be liquidity void

2921
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:42,900
or inefficiency or like I have a shaded

2922
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,699
here up here

2923
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:46,380
they're measured

2924
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:48,300
from the highest high and the lowest low

2925
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:51,780
of that respective inefficiency or Gap

2926
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:54,060
and the midpoint is always referred to

2927
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:58,320
as consequent encroachment meaning that

2928
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,440
as it starts to fill in and re-price to

2929
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,199
the high or low of these levels

2930
01:59:04,199 --> 01:59:07,500
as it encroaches it's

2931
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,440
most likely to refer to the midpoint of

2932
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:11,520
the gap

2933
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,159
or inefficiency than the extreme high or

2934
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,739
the low and that's the basis of why we

2935
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:18,900
like to see

2936
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:21,000
if we're bearish we want to see the

2937
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,239
upper end of the inefficiency or Gap

2938
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:25,980
respected and treated as a premium and

2939
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,800
not be dug into meaning as I mentioned

2940
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,139
before we took our break we don't want

2941
01:59:31,139 --> 01:59:33,060
to see the high end of any inefficiency

2942
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,480
be retraded to if we're bearish if the

2943
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,719
market is really in fact in a cell model

2944
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,880
the best ones the strongest delivering

2945
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,420
obvious Runners will always have this

2946
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:48,060
signature Hallmark part to it where the

2947
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,679
upper portion of it doesn't get treated

2948
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:50,820
to

2949
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:53,099
look at the bodies of the candles

2950
01:59:53,099 --> 01:59:55,080
we have just a little bit of movement

2951
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,060
above it here but look at these right

2952
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:58,920
there right on that midpoint of that you

2953
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,659
think that's random

2954
02:00:00,659 --> 02:00:02,580
when I talked about it on the 13th of

2955
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:05,219
June in that live stream I said I want

2956
02:00:05,219 --> 02:00:09,179
to see does this show signatures in

2957
02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:13,380
PA that confirms it suggests

2958
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:16,380
that my assumptions by anticipating this

2959
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:18,719
level that's shaded in in a pale orange

2960
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,639
that that would be treated as resistance

2961
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,139
or a means of

2962
02:00:22,139 --> 02:00:24,480
beginning short trades for smart money

2963
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,420
and in targeting

2964
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,860
this level down here which is the bull

2965
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:31,380
shorter block on the daily chart

2966
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,139
so in your mind

2967
02:00:34,139 --> 02:00:36,239
as a Trader going forward whenever I say

2968
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,580
things like that or I say I'm looking at

2969
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:40,560
this as a premium array I want to see it

2970
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,099
be treated as a wrist of resistance

2971
02:00:44,099 --> 02:00:46,679
and then enter a cell program and I

2972
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:48,000
point to where I think it's going to go

2973
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,239
right away in your mind you start

2974
02:00:51,239 --> 02:00:52,619
thinking okay

2975
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:55,739
he just told me where he believes with

2976
02:00:55,739 --> 02:00:58,199
30 years of experience where it's likely

2977
02:00:58,199 --> 02:01:01,260
to go so I just told you bias

2978
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,540
I cut through all the I got

2979
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,060
right to the point if I sat down with

2980
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:06,900
you

2981
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,060
and taught you every single week what

2982
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:11,699
I'm doing you like first of all I would

2983
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:13,020
never get that we're we're still in

2984
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,699
dollar we just finally made our way into

2985
02:01:14,699 --> 02:01:16,800
the 15-minute chart it does not take you

2986
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,719
this long to do the analysis

2987
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:21,060
but it does take me this long

2988
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:22,739
and as long as it's going to take the

2989
02:01:22,739 --> 02:01:24,719
day for me to teach you what it is

2990
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:26,460
that's going on in my mind to make the

2991
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:27,840
decisions to tell you before it happens

2992
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,280
and it happens in your chart later on

2993
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,099
perfectly you want to know you show up

2994
02:01:32,099 --> 02:01:33,599
you want to ask me these questions and

2995
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,219
I'm giving you the answers don't

2996
02:01:35,219 --> 02:01:36,659
at how long it takes me to give it to

2997
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:39,360
you because it's not an easy and you get

2998
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,980
the information like you have to weigh

2999
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,540
out a lot of things

3000
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:44,460
which it's not an easy one two three

3001
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,800
program there is no easy one two three

3002
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,560
Precision out there outside of this

3003
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,599
there's things you can make money with

3004
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:52,980
but you're never going to come to the

3005
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,659
conclusion that I'm showing you as

3006
02:01:54,659 --> 02:01:56,460
consistent as I am with anything else

3007
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:58,560
this is the market

3008
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:01,260
so when you hear me talk about in a

3009
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:03,420
tweet a Twitter space

3010
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:06,020
or if I share the analysis on a

3011
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:08,159
presentation whether it be live streamed

3012
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:10,980
or a recording review and I'll give you

3013
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:12,179
opinion about what I think it's going to

3014
02:02:12,179 --> 02:02:14,219
do next that's the time when you start

3015
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:17,340
paying attention the most okay you want

3016
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:18,960
to say all right

3017
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,500
he anticipates me ICT is telling you

3018
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,719
that we're expecting to see this area

3019
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:25,860
that shaded

3020
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:28,679
be treated as an Inception of a Down

3021
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:30,119
move

3022
02:02:30,119 --> 02:02:32,040
and terminus

3023
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,780
the end of the move

3024
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:35,520
the low hanging fruit that's all I'm

3025
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,900
stating when I say that it doesn't mean

3026
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:39,300
it's the end of the line

3027
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,520
it can't go any further than that

3028
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,360
no I'm telling you how to frame a setup

3029
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,699
an element to every element

3030
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:49,980
that makes up a trade has to have

3031
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:52,139
several factors

3032
02:02:52,139 --> 02:02:54,239
it's the Inception of a move

3033
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:55,800
where it begins

3034
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,900
but by itself there has to be some

3035
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,940
narrative reason why that trade should

3036
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,080
even form

3037
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:02,699
which is what I've spent all this time

3038
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:04,619
thus far explaining why we're seeing

3039
02:03:04,619 --> 02:03:05,820
what we're seeing in the chart right now

3040
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:07,500
which is what I outlined and told you

3041
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:12,320
was going to happen on the 13th of June

3042
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,300
you look for

3043
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:18,000
in time periods of the day where I teach

3044
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,500
you as kill zones

3045
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,080
London

3046
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,280
two o'clock to five o'clock in the

3047
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,380
morning New York local time

3048
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:28,199
if we have a bias okay for the number

3049
02:03:28,199 --> 02:03:30,540
crunchers out there if we have a bias

3050
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,520
that is indicating that the market is

3051
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,280
likely to expand lower on the weekly

3052
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,840
chart that means the candle is going to

3053
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:40,199
expand down right away 80 of your bias

3054
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:42,060
problem has already been solved by

3055
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:45,260
itself with that alum

3056
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:49,320
to have to wait for all the calendar

3057
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:52,800
events to either support or negate the

3058
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,420
idea

3059
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:57,420
so we had a series of what big news and

3060
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:00,679
Friends news drivers this week

3061
02:04:00,679 --> 02:04:03,360
FOMC CPI

3062
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,340
all those things you watched me told you

3063
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,679
how to navigate them

3064
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,260
not to trade ahead of them but after you

3065
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:11,699
see that information come into the

3066
02:04:11,699 --> 02:04:13,800
marketplace and all the sentiments shift

3067
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,420
that they create

3068
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,580
we're not looking at the data we're not

3069
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:19,679
seeing what the raw number suggests and

3070
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:22,020
I could care less I never look at that

3071
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:24,719
stuff folks it's never a factor but I'm

3072
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,460
anticipating the medium or high impact

3073
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:28,619
news driver to create and present

3074
02:04:28,619 --> 02:04:32,219
volatility and in that volatility we're

3075
02:04:32,219 --> 02:04:34,560
looking for where does the stops rest

3076
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,139
after that first initial move

3077
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:39,659
where do stop losses reside above old

3078
02:04:39,659 --> 02:04:41,639
highs or below where are those highs and

3079
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:43,500
lows we don't know where they're going

3080
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,980
to form before CPI we don't know where

3081
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,560
they're going to form before FOMC

3082
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,719
does its first move

3083
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:53,940
we don't know where NFP is

3084
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:56,159
going to use the high and low that it

3085
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,679
creates after the initial run at E30

3086
02:04:58,679 --> 02:05:00,780
when that news driver comes out which is

3087
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,179
the reason why I tell you as my students

3088
02:05:03,179 --> 02:05:06,119
don't trade those you don't know what

3089
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:07,440
you're doing I don't know what they're

3090
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,880
going to do they could manual intervene

3091
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,940
and send these things wherever

3092
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:15,659
that's gambling I'm not gambling I'm not

3093
02:05:15,659 --> 02:05:17,520
trying to inspire any of you to try to

3094
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,199
throw darts and see if you can get a

3095
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:21,900
bullseye where there's no skill involved

3096
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,820
that's happenstance if you make money

3097
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:25,739
but mostly you're going to lose

3098
02:05:25,739 --> 02:05:27,480
so what we do is we wait for that

3099
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,580
initial manipulation to come into the

3100
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:31,739
marketplace that you can schedule and

3101
02:05:31,739 --> 02:05:33,840
set your watch to and it's all on the

3102
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,219
economic calendar

3103
02:05:35,219 --> 02:05:36,840
the economic calendar is going to tell

3104
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,219
you the time of these reports that are

3105
02:05:38,219 --> 02:05:39,119
coming up

3106
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,580
the market is not moving because of the

3107
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,659
report

3108
02:05:42,659 --> 02:05:46,380
period okay that data

3109
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:49,860
it's in an envelope somewhere okay weeks

3110
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,900
in advance

3111
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:53,340
you think that the people the powers

3112
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:56,040
that be that really are greedy you think

3113
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:57,900
that they're waiting around for that

3114
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,099
same amount of information that

3115
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:01,619
everybody else is getting no

3116
02:06:01,619 --> 02:06:03,000
no

3117
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,820
so all of this is a lie it's a myth to

3118
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:08,219
believe that fundamentals can be timed

3119
02:06:08,219 --> 02:06:10,440
on a report release

3120
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:13,080
that report being released

3121
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,300
is a smoke screen and they're always

3122
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,840
going to use these as a

3123
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,280
justification for okay the market

3124
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,440
reacted to this data when it works in

3125
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,119
the favor they try to say it is but when

3126
02:06:24,119 --> 02:06:25,440
it doesn't they always say well the

3127
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,060
market priced it in

3128
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:28,380
and I was mentioning that before we went

3129
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:31,020
into our break so

3130
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,820
when I tell you where I think the

3131
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:34,860
Market's going to react

3132
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:37,619
okay that's a key point of reference in

3133
02:06:37,619 --> 02:06:39,480
the either the market I'm talking about

3134
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,460
or a specific time frame

3135
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:43,260
so we were working with the daily chart

3136
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:46,619
which is where most of your decision

3137
02:06:46,619 --> 02:06:48,060
making

3138
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,460
for either a day trade a short-term

3139
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:52,619
trade or whatever the bias is derived

3140
02:06:52,619 --> 02:06:54,659
from the weekly chart and and where it's

3141
02:06:54,659 --> 02:06:56,580
likely to draw to that's it then you're

3142
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:58,500
moving on to the daily chart and daily

3143
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,179
chart is you're watching and monitoring

3144
02:07:00,179 --> 02:07:03,599
how each individual daily candle forms

3145
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:05,520
if you're bearish as we've been

3146
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,940
expecting since the 13th of this week

3147
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:11,159
we want to see how does price gravitate

3148
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:12,239
to

3149
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:14,040
this level down here which is that

3150
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:17,000
bullish order block

3151
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:20,940
so each individual day we have to weigh

3152
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:25,199
out does it run into that shaded area up

3153
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:26,760
here which is what I outlined this we

3154
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,739
want to see does the algorithm offer

3155
02:07:28,739 --> 02:07:31,739
price there and if it does once it

3156
02:07:31,739 --> 02:07:34,800
enters it at what time of day well what

3157
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,540
Market are we looking at

3158
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,340
dollar

3159
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:41,940
so primary interest is

3160
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,820
nailing down the high of the day

3161
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:46,739
where is the high of the day going to

3162
02:07:46,739 --> 02:07:48,719
form in a market

3163
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:51,840
that is trading at a level we expect the

3164
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,239
price to react to

3165
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:56,400
so we've been we're expecting the

3166
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,520
Inception of a Down move between

3167
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:04,139
one of three levels in here right no

3168
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:06,540
midpoint or the low of that shaded area

3169
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:08,639
remember what I said if we're bearish

3170
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,679
every inefficiency

3171
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:12,659
if we're going to use it as a basis or a

3172
02:08:12,659 --> 02:08:16,199
framework for a trade we want to see in

3173
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:17,460
a

3174
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,260
premium array that's going to be used to

3175
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:22,139
sell off and send price lower

3176
02:08:22,139 --> 02:08:24,360
we don't want the upper portion to be

3177
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,560
respected

3178
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:27,540
because if it doesn't get up there like

3179
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:29,760
we're seeing right here

3180
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,099
that's really indicating that this is

3181
02:08:32,099 --> 02:08:35,639
going to be a strong probability

3182
02:08:35,639 --> 02:08:39,780
for what the trade down two and through

3183
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:42,560
that order block

3184
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:46,760
time of day now okay

3185
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,800
got this fancy Kill Zone indicator right

3186
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,980
here

3187
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:09,599
I drove my annotations out Folks by

3188
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:12,540
hand I know that you like to have these

3189
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,820
little gizmos that do it

3190
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:17,880
but nothing beats

3191
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:19,679
High touch over high tech

3192
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,199
it makes it more meaningful to you it's

3193
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:24,900
like meditation for me and you know it's

3194
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,219
a little tedious

3195
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:27,599
sometimes when I have to do a whole lot

3196
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:29,040
of annotations but

3197
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,659
with my heart's in it like this you know

3198
02:09:30,659 --> 02:09:32,580
I don't mind doing it so here's London

3199
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:34,440
open and we're dealing with the dollar

3200
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:37,320
Index and I mentioned on the 13th that

3201
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,239
we would want to see the price of dollar

3202
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:42,060
go up into this shaded area which is the

3203
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:43,380
old inversion for your recap on the

3204
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:45,300
weekly chart so we've taken that Weekly

3205
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:48,480
chart for your vegap and transposed it

3206
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:51,599
to all time frames lower than it so that

3207
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,760
way whenever annotations you put on your

3208
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,679
weekly chart you want to make sure that

3209
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:57,599
you show that annotation on all time

3210
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:00,739
frames and how do you do that

3211
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:06,960
you highlight the the array that you're

3212
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,760
you know annotating on your weekly chart

3213
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:10,800
and then

3214
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,739
current interval and Below or all

3215
02:10:13,739 --> 02:10:16,679
intervals is basically the same thing

3216
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:18,179
then you'll see on every time frame when

3217
02:10:18,179 --> 02:10:20,400
you go through your HTF

3218
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,380
weekly daily

3219
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:25,619
four hour eight hour 15 minute chart 30

3220
02:10:25,619 --> 02:10:28,080
second chart every it'll always be there

3221
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,739
okay

3222
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:36,599
inside this window of time that begins

3223
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:38,699
at the left side of that London open

3224
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:40,800
Killzone annotation box

3225
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:43,739
to the right side in this area

3226
02:10:43,739 --> 02:10:45,840
is when

3227
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,760
when

3228
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,280
the trade begins when the shift in

3229
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:53,400
Market structure will occur when the

3230
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:56,159
high of the day forms

3231
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:58,080
seventy percent

3232
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,020
you have a probability that the high of

3233
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,159
the day

3234
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:05,099
will form between two o'clock in the

3235
02:11:05,099 --> 02:11:06,719
morning and five o'clock in the morning

3236
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,599
New York local time but you have to have

3237
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:11,280
the other ingredients you can't just

3238
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,619
simply say Okay highs and lows let's run

3239
02:11:13,619 --> 02:11:15,480
some numbers and calculate does the high

3240
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:18,420
of the day form on two o'clock to

3241
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:19,860
five o'clock on this day this day this

3242
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:22,380
day now you have to have the the

3243
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,960
narrative in mind and I gave it to you

3244
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:28,199
on the 13th I told you what to use this

3245
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:29,880
shaded area

3246
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,820
my longer term students to know that if

3247
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,980
we're bearish we don't want to see all

3248
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:37,199
of the inefficiency respected

3249
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:39,599
which is a breakaway Gap if it's a fair

3250
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,280
value Gap but we've already worked

3251
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,199
inside this range already but now we're

3252
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,639
treating it as

3253
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:47,219
a resistance that means it can trade up

3254
02:11:47,219 --> 02:11:50,699
to the low and reject and go lower or we

3255
02:11:50,699 --> 02:11:51,719
permit

3256
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:55,320
we permit our analysis to see price

3257
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:56,880
trade up into the midpoint which is

3258
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,340
consequent increasing right here

3259
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:00,659
so

3260
02:12:00,659 --> 02:12:03,860
I'm going to take that level off

3261
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:05,520
here we go

3262
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:07,260
so when we're trading at consequent

3263
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:09,360
encroachment here

3264
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:12,300
and it's in London open

3265
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,400
we bumped the high

3266
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,920
we want to see price do what

3267
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,560
showing willingness to want to go lower

3268
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,139
does it sharply leave

3269
02:12:22,139 --> 02:12:24,300
once it trades up in here hits the buy

3270
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,940
side here and then all this back and

3271
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:28,679
forth movement that I'm showing you

3272
02:12:28,679 --> 02:12:31,940
right here all this here

3273
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:35,040
price is spending time in that range is

3274
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:36,780
it efficiently delivered

3275
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:42,119
yes why because it's moved up

3276
02:12:42,119 --> 02:12:44,580
down

3277
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:46,380
up

3278
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:48,300
but it's only keying off of the levels

3279
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:50,219
I've told you to focus on inside that

3280
02:12:50,219 --> 02:12:51,980
shaded area

3281
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:54,000
consequent encroachment

3282
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,699
we want to see does it reject after

3283
02:12:56,699 --> 02:12:59,460
bumping the high here yes

3284
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:02,520
once it leaves that shaded area how did

3285
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:05,000
it leave it

3286
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,040
energetically yes

3287
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:12,239
so now enter model 2022.

3288
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:14,280
BS taken

3289
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,659
here

3290
02:13:15,659 --> 02:13:18,900
shift in Market structure there

3291
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:21,960
very bad you got there

3292
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,060
I know I don't know corners of your

3293
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:26,900
mouth is hurting now

3294
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,480
foreign

3295
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,480
happening all right so

3296
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,639
we have our shift in Market structure we

3297
02:13:35,639 --> 02:13:37,800
have our FVG and then over

3298
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:38,880
here

3299
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,739
what is this

3300
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:43,020
what time of day is that

3301
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,579
8 am

3302
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:47,460
so you're in the heart of what New York

3303
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:49,020
open Killzone

3304
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:50,639
seven o'clock to nine o'clock that's

3305
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:52,920
your little sweet spot

3306
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,780
your your setup is going to form

3307
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:00,139
continuation

3308
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:03,360
you hold down control and drag by the

3309
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,440
way in case you're gonna I learned that

3310
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:06,300
from my students

3311
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,619
all right seven o'clock

3312
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:14,400
it can be left at 10 o'clock but I'm

3313
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,599
going to show you the

3314
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:18,920
oops don't want to do that

3315
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:25,260
9 A.M

3316
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,520
and this is New York

3317
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:34,739
okay so inside this little window of

3318
02:14:34,739 --> 02:14:36,119
opportunity here

3319
02:14:36,119 --> 02:14:38,639
you're focusing on what

3320
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:41,159
we've already worked up inside that

3321
02:14:41,159 --> 02:14:43,020
consequent encroachment here we've

3322
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:44,639
already seen the evidence that it wants

3323
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:46,619
to reject that we have a shift in Market

3324
02:14:46,619 --> 02:14:48,360
structure we have a FVG in

3325
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:52,199
the market rallies up into what

3326
02:14:52,199 --> 02:14:54,480
time of day that's when the move is

3327
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,940
going to happen New York local time

3328
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:58,320
seven o'clock in the morning to nine

3329
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,699
o'clock in the morning that's your New

3330
02:14:59,699 --> 02:15:01,800
York open ICT Killzone

3331
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,079
this is the London open Killzone

3332
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:07,760
this is your premium array

3333
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:10,560
the range is from this high down to that

3334
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,480
low that's the lowest low

3335
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:16,079
here's 50 a premium is at or higher than

3336
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:18,719
that does that fair value got qualify as

3337
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:20,579
a premium array relative to that high in

3338
02:15:20,579 --> 02:15:23,099
that low yes

3339
02:15:23,099 --> 02:15:25,679
is price returning back up to

3340
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:30,239
that shaded area yes where specifically

3341
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,119
the low end of it

3342
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:34,500
it doesn't need to go back up to

3343
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:37,219
consequent encouragement

3344
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,139
oh

3345
02:15:40,139 --> 02:15:42,239
consequent encroachment it showed the

3346
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:44,400
signature that we would look for it left

3347
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:48,659
the upper portion untraded to again

3348
02:15:48,659 --> 02:15:51,000
worked off the low of that Gap

3349
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,280
if you don't have these levels on your

3350
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,440
chart or have them at least annotated in

3351
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:56,460
your notes that you're referring to

3352
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:59,040
throughout the day now in the beginning

3353
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,199
you want to definitely have them

3354
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:02,820
in your chart because it's going to take

3355
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:04,440
you some time to get used to seeing the

3356
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,480
market like this but over years and

3357
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,520
years of time doing it you'll be able to

3358
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:09,840
work off of a notepad and you won't have

3359
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,360
anything on your chart at all it'll be a

3360
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:14,280
naked chart and it's okay

3361
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,099
but it takes experience to do that okay

3362
02:16:17,099 --> 02:16:18,599
and obviously you can see how quickly if

3363
02:16:18,599 --> 02:16:19,800
you're not organized you can get really

3364
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,139
really lost working from one Higher time

3365
02:16:22,139 --> 02:16:24,119
frame down the LTF but by

3366
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:26,400
having the HTF logic and

3367
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,380
all these reference points in mind

3368
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:30,960
suddenly these mystifying moves that

3369
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,580
come out of nowhere for you and you

3370
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:33,478
don't know where it came from and

3371
02:16:33,478 --> 02:16:34,920
everybody's on social media saying what

3372
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,540
the hell just happened where'd that come

3373
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:39,540
from we don't have that here you know in

3374
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:41,160
this community we come across as

3375
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:44,160
arrogant and many times as narcissistic

3376
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,780
because we know what the we're

3377
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:47,519
doing we know exactly what we're looking

3378
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:49,138
for we know exactly how it's going to

3379
02:16:49,138 --> 02:16:51,478
form when it's going to form and when we

3380
02:16:51,478 --> 02:16:53,519
take it down and we share it with our

3381
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:56,340
tribe the people on the outside they get

3382
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,379
pissed off they think oh they they think

3383
02:16:58,379 --> 02:16:59,638
their doesn't stink right here well

3384
02:16:59,638 --> 02:17:01,138
it doesn't baby it smells like roses and

3385
02:17:01,138 --> 02:17:02,160
chocolate chip cookies fresh

3386
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,138
from the oven whether you like it or not

3387
02:17:04,138 --> 02:17:06,179
I don't care you don't have to stay here

3388
02:17:06,179 --> 02:17:09,679
but this stuff repeats every single week

3389
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:12,179
every single week it happens every

3390
02:17:12,179 --> 02:17:13,379
single week

3391
02:17:13,379 --> 02:17:17,398
now every single day is not the same in

3392
02:17:17,398 --> 02:17:18,959
terms of opportunity sometimes you'll

3393
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:21,200
see setups that are much more favorable

3394
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,478
than like we're seeing

3395
02:17:23,478 --> 02:17:26,760
in lesser volatile days but when we

3396
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:28,859
anticipate a direction in the

3397
02:17:28,859 --> 02:17:30,359
marketplace and it's derived from a

3398
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:31,920
HTF weekly chart using the

3399
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,420
logic that I teach my students that I've

3400
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:34,679
been teaching them publicly on the

3401
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:36,478
YouTube channel

3402
02:17:36,478 --> 02:17:38,459
it gives you the framework for one shot

3403
02:17:38,459 --> 02:17:40,920
one kill setups where you can get in and

3404
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,320
take a lines portion of the weekly range

3405
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,700
out doesn't mean you're trying to get

3406
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:46,859
the entire weekly range it just means

3407
02:17:46,859 --> 02:17:50,820
that you need a small piece of it that

3408
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,379
will satisfy you

3409
02:17:52,379 --> 02:17:54,120
and if you consider like a chicken bone

3410
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,920
I use this analogy a lot

3411
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:59,099
um do you eat the small little scraps on

3412
02:17:59,099 --> 02:18:01,500
the the ends of a chicken bone

3413
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,120
I mean if you're really a fan of chicken

3414
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:06,599
I guess you do but when I eat it I just

3415
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:08,820
took the meat on the one thicker end of

3416
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:10,558
it and sometimes it'd be something left

3417
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:12,898
on the boom but I'm taking the majority

3418
02:18:12,898 --> 02:18:15,000
of the off

3419
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,978
I'm not worrying about starting the

3420
02:18:16,978 --> 02:18:19,019
eating process at the end of the boom

3421
02:18:19,019 --> 02:18:21,478
regardless of what end it is so I'm

3422
02:18:21,478 --> 02:18:22,859
looking for where the meat of the move

3423
02:18:22,859 --> 02:18:25,859
is and my Concepts have been aimed at

3424
02:18:25,859 --> 02:18:28,500
trying to get you to where

3425
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,840
the meat is but you don't need the

3426
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,280
highest high in the lowest low but I

3427
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,840
teach you how to find that too

3428
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,459
so if you want to nitpick and get in

3429
02:18:35,459 --> 02:18:36,718
like you're eating crabs and dig into

3430
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:38,099
all the little crevices and nooks and

3431
02:18:38,099 --> 02:18:39,898
crannies to get every little morsel out

3432
02:18:39,898 --> 02:18:42,299
that's what my mentorship does it's for

3433
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:44,040
freaks that want to be like that I'm a

3434
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:45,540
freak I'd like to know everything I like

3435
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:47,280
to be in everything I'm a control freak

3436
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,859
I want to know everything I want to know

3437
02:18:49,859 --> 02:18:51,540
why it's going to happen when it's going

3438
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:53,398
to happen when is it going to fail how

3439
02:18:53,398 --> 02:18:55,620
will it fail and because I know those

3440
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:57,599
things I know when not to tread in the

3441
02:18:57,599 --> 02:18:59,580
marketplace I know when not to touch the

3442
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:01,260
marketplace that's what makes me

3443
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:02,519
consistent that's what makes me better

3444
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:04,200
than everybody else out there because

3445
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,299
nobody else has spent any sufficient

3446
02:19:06,299 --> 02:19:09,420
time trying to Define where they're

3447
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,099
likely to fail

3448
02:19:11,099 --> 02:19:13,558
because they're so focused on trying to

3449
02:19:13,558 --> 02:19:15,780
find how they can be better and right

3450
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:18,058
and profitable all the time and think

3451
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:19,620
that it's limited to whatever their stop

3452
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:22,260
loss is and that's all they need no I

3453
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:23,760
want to know when the market can trick

3454
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:27,599
me even with my content there are times

3455
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,820
that if I don't know by experience and I

3456
02:19:29,820 --> 02:19:31,558
had to learn this you know with decades

3457
02:19:31,558 --> 02:19:34,320
there are times that even though I

3458
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,879
believe that my analysis concepts are

3459
02:19:35,879 --> 02:19:36,959
superior to everything and everything

3460
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:39,000
that ever will exist because it is the

3461
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,959
market it's tied into the algorithm

3462
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:45,718
I can as the operator you as the

3463
02:19:45,718 --> 02:19:48,478
operator you as the user you will read

3464
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:49,920
into price

3465
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,080
like a Rorschach an inkblot you'll see

3466
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,600
something that you want to see

3467
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:57,359
and many times social media will

3468
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,939
cultivate that atmosphere where you get

3469
02:19:59,939 --> 02:20:01,920
mad you get jealous you can get

3470
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:04,140
competitive you can get offended by

3471
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:05,580
somebody or I'm going to show him I'm

3472
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,380
going to show her or I didn't do as good

3473
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:08,939
as that person that means just try to

3474
02:20:08,939 --> 02:20:11,220
outdo them and you go in and you try to

3475
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:13,859
find something as a reason to get into a

3476
02:20:13,859 --> 02:20:16,020
trade we don't do that here

3477
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:19,080
we do not do that here you have to stick

3478
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:22,140
to the rules time and price

3479
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:25,500
where are you at in that Weekly outline

3480
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:27,420
that you spent time on when the market

3481
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:29,640
wasn't trading after Friday's close and

3482
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,380
before Sunday's opening wherever that is

3483
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,460
for you

3484
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:34,140
if you're a church goer you know

3485
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,300
whatever you know find some time in the

3486
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:37,979
weekend you know if you want to have a

3487
02:20:37,979 --> 02:20:40,020
day of rest and You observe the sabbath

3488
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:42,899
I don't tell you what day to use you

3489
02:20:42,899 --> 02:20:44,100
know you have to have one day at rest

3490
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:46,260
period don't anybody tell you what day

3491
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:49,399
it has to be just one day

3492
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:51,540
don't do anything on the market that day

3493
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:54,359
but between Friday's close and Sunday's

3494
02:20:54,359 --> 02:20:56,760
opening you have to find time to sit

3495
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,600
down

3496
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,120
and meditate on that Weekly chart what

3497
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:02,040
is it likely to do what's it likely to

3498
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:04,560
what momentum is presently in play and

3499
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,080
what is it gravitating to and by Framing

3500
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,180
those ideas on that Weekly chart and

3501
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:10,979
transposing them to LTFs

3502
02:21:10,979 --> 02:21:14,399
suddenly everything jumps off and it

3503
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:16,500
means so much more and it's much more

3504
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,000
clearer

3505
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,280
to see what it is that you've missed

3506
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:22,680
you've missed all this time

3507
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,939
all right so

3508
02:21:23,939 --> 02:21:26,399
the the idea of

3509
02:21:26,399 --> 02:21:28,800
how far price runs can go I'm going to

3510
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,180
use that here

3511
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:31,859
just for a frame of reference I'm gonna

3512
02:21:31,859 --> 02:21:33,319
go back up to the daily chart

3513
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:35,760
encapsulate that entire down closed

3514
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:38,300
candle here

3515
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,720
we'll use

3516
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:47,180
a yellow I don't really like yellow

3517
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:58,560
all right so that's the entirety of the

3518
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,479
bullish over block and the expectation

3519
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,340
is we want to see does it want to

3520
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:04,500
gravitate lower and get into this area

3521
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:07,200
down here okay and I'll I'll hold off

3522
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:08,580
I'll Reserve doing that you just have

3523
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:10,500
that on your chart as well I'm gonna

3524
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:12,780
drop down into a 15 minute chart again

3525
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:14,760
I know it's ugly

3526
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:17,399
but this range is the entirety of the

3527
02:22:17,399 --> 02:22:19,740
order block and the expectation is we

3528
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,600
want to we want to see it trade down to

3529
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,399
consequent encroachment and go below it

3530
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:25,200
we want to see that weakness that

3531
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:27,960
heaviness because we want to see the

3532
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:28,979
move

3533
02:22:28,979 --> 02:22:32,880
protract further lower which would give

3534
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:36,540
momentum to being a long holder to stock

3535
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:40,760
index Futures and foreign currency

3536
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:43,560
this move right here

3537
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:47,040
this move right there that is your

3538
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,020
trigger swing that's the that's the

3539
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:51,240
measuring point for what you want to see

3540
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:56,780
for protractions or Fibonacci extensions

3541
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,720
you take your FIB you anchor it

3542
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:02,580
draw it down to the low of that price

3543
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:03,840
swing

3544
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,280
okay I'm going to show you where my

3545
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,140
settings are again I've done this in the

3546
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:08,780
past

3547
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:12,439
I don't need them

3548
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:15,300
standard deviation three and two and a

3549
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,500
half

3550
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:19,819
so here's where we're at

3551
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,520
close it so we have a high

3552
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:26,880
to low and the entirety of that daily

3553
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:29,880
order block is shaded in yellow notice

3554
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:33,600
that that Fibonacci extension negative

3555
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:36,600
2.5 which is two and a half times the

3556
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:39,120
range of the low to the high here this

3557
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,979
is all I use a Fibonacci for folks

3558
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:43,800
that's it okay I'm not in here looking

3559
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,660
for bat patterns and crab patterns and

3560
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,399
butterflies and all that stuff I'm

3561
02:23:47,399 --> 02:23:50,520
looking at math okay that's it this is

3562
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:51,960
the range that matters

3563
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:57,120
and there has to be a Confluence of time

3564
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:00,560
time being London close London close

3565
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,819
begins at 10 o'clock in the morning New

3566
02:24:02,819 --> 02:24:06,359
York over time and ends at noon there is

3567
02:24:06,359 --> 02:24:08,340
a buffer I add to it when there's a big

3568
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,780
runoff day

3569
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:12,240
it can extend into one o'clock it's far

3570
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:15,000
and few between if you use just the 10

3571
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,979
o'clock in the morning to 12 noon New

3572
02:24:16,979 --> 02:24:18,380
York local time is your London close

3573
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:22,700
Killzone it will serve you well okay

3574
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:26,819
huge huge step forward and watch

3575
02:24:26,819 --> 02:24:30,319
at 10 o'clock in the morning

3576
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,040
to noon

3577
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,220
I hope you're having fun with this I'm

3578
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:46,020
loving this

3579
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:49,100
should have charged admission

3580
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:50,640
close

3581
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:52,080
okay so there's your London closed

3582
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:54,439
Killzone

3583
02:24:57,899 --> 02:24:59,520
there's things in my way kind of pisses

3584
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:02,180
me off now actually

3585
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:04,140
so now here's what I want you to look at

3586
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:06,000
all right

3587
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,640
these mysterious markets

3588
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,220
okay we want to know where price can

3589
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:13,080
begin a move

3590
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,359
and where it can gravitate to where is

3591
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:17,460
it drawing to Let's draw on liquidity

3592
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:20,040
and we want to frame it in the form of a

3593
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:22,500
low hanging fruit terminus

3594
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:26,819
the Inception of a move can be timed

3595
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:29,040
the Inception of the move

3596
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,780
can be determined

3597
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:33,960
within a specific price level or within

3598
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:36,600
a range like an inefficiency and in that

3599
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,819
range there's three specific price

3600
02:25:38,819 --> 02:25:40,319
levels

3601
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:42,359
three

3602
02:25:42,359 --> 02:25:44,819
that

3603
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:46,500
three levels

3604
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:49,140
is used on a basis of whether we're

3605
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:50,939
bullish or bearish so as I was

3606
02:25:50,939 --> 02:25:53,160
mentioning earlier we were

3607
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,500
expecting this shaded area up here on

3608
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:57,780
the weekly chart that old inversion fair

3609
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:59,939
value Gap to be treated as resistance

3610
02:25:59,939 --> 02:26:01,319
the algorithm would trade up into it

3611
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:06,120
during time notice that it reacted here

3612
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:09,180
this is the essentially the midpoint

3613
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:10,500
or consequent approaching of the entire

3614
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:12,479
range but look at the time of the day

3615
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:14,700
it's one o'clock in the morning

3616
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:17,700
that's European European open yes but

3617
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:19,800
the heart of the move and what I teach

3618
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,660
by rules is the higher the low the

3619
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:23,340
higher the low of the day is for between

3620
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:24,840
two o'clock

3621
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:27,920
and five o'clock in the morning

3622
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:31,859
when we get here at 2 45

3623
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:33,720
we're doing two things number one we're

3624
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:35,700
bumping the high

3625
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:37,859
so anyone that went short up here on

3626
02:26:37,859 --> 02:26:40,319
valid based ideas in Long foreign

3627
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:41,300
currency

3628
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:43,800
I'm tempted to put the Euro up here real

3629
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,060
quick but I don't want to mess up the

3630
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:46,620
chart before I finish what I'm deciding

3631
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:48,359
but we'll come back to this this here

3632
02:26:48,359 --> 02:26:50,460
okay in a second but during the London

3633
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:53,819
open Kill Zone then it creates the high

3634
02:26:53,819 --> 02:26:57,720
you have a 70 probability of the high

3635
02:26:57,720 --> 02:27:00,180
forming when you're bearish when you're

3636
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:01,500
expecting the market to deliver as I

3637
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:04,439
outlined on the 13th of June 2023

3638
02:27:04,439 --> 02:27:06,899
going to a level I've outlined on the

3639
02:27:06,899 --> 02:27:09,319
13th

3640
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:12,300
this level right here is your low

3641
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:14,760
hanging fruit objective

3642
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:18,479
that's not the end of the road it means

3643
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:22,200
that you frame that idea of taking a

3644
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,100
trade

3645
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,800
with this as your draw on liquidity but

3646
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,899
every single trade I enter

3647
02:27:27,899 --> 02:27:30,420
every single trade I enter I always look

3648
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:32,100
for some kind of a best case scenario

3649
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:34,880
something more than I expected okay

3650
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:37,140
many times I don't ever get that

3651
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:39,240
sometimes I'll get stopped out sometimes

3652
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:42,120
it just simply doesn't give it to me and

3653
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:44,100
I change my opinion or mind about where

3654
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:46,020
I'm at and I Collapse the trade or take

3655
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:48,359
too many Parcels off to justify

3656
02:27:48,359 --> 02:27:50,520
holding on and it's just it's an

3657
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,200
evolving thing and that's one of the

3658
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,700
weaknesses I've been very candid about

3659
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:56,760
my exits are always a work in progress

3660
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,859
and I've been doing this for three

3661
02:27:58,859 --> 02:28:01,979
decades so I'm not satisfied my entries

3662
02:28:01,979 --> 02:28:04,020
if I never develop another entry

3663
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:07,439
strategy I'll be fine I got 81 of them

3664
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:09,899
but you only need one

3665
02:28:09,899 --> 02:28:11,760
you only need one of them so if you were

3666
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:13,740
to look at a breaker here you have a

3667
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:16,979
high low higher high extend the breaker

3668
02:28:16,979 --> 02:28:18,960
over you'd be entering short there if

3669
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:22,080
you're using OTE okay I

3670
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,760
had to FIB up earlier let me do it again

3671
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:25,740
if you're just using the flagship the

3672
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:27,300
old Flagship pattern

3673
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:30,140
of

3674
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:35,540
my YouTube channel

3675
02:28:40,939 --> 02:28:45,359
and this one's gonna come off

3676
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:47,580
all right so these two blue lines here

3677
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:50,520
that is the classic ICT optimal trade

3678
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:52,140
entry which is a standard three-quarter

3679
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:53,640
pullback

3680
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:57,120
high to low it trades up into

3681
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,920
I'm quite certain that's probably 70.5

3682
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:00,720
which is The Sweet Spot I teach on the

3683
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,160
OTE if you want to watch

3684
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,080
anything about OTE if

3685
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:06,240
it's peaking your interest I have many

3686
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:08,399
videos in this YouTube channel just do a

3687
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:11,700
search on my channel for OTE optimal

3688
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:14,040
trade entry that trade up into that

3689
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:15,660
right there is perfect

3690
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:17,700
and it's just a beautiful run from there

3691
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:19,319
down

3692
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:21,420
so you could use that as your entry

3693
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:23,460
pattern okay entering on the fair value

3694
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:24,420
guy

3695
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:27,720
here which is the 2022 model so right

3696
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,640
away there's three ways of getting in it

3697
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:32,100
there's three different models to get in

3698
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:35,060
that same price move

3699
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:38,819
which one which one do you like

3700
02:29:38,819 --> 02:29:41,340
it's a matter of preference

3701
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:44,100
but we have this run here

3702
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:46,260
to here and we have a standard deviation

3703
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:48,540
of negative 2.5 which is just outside

3704
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:51,780
the scope of the entirety of that daily

3705
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:53,340
bullet shoulder block which is that

3706
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:55,020
shaded area in yellow

3707
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:56,760
let me take it back up so that way you

3708
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,200
know what I'm referring to

3709
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:00,060
this down closed candle here on the

3710
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,280
daily chart

3711
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:06,000
right there I mentioned on the 13th that

3712
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,580
full entire range

3713
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:11,340
as soon as we start moving past midpoint

3714
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:12,960
which is consequently I'm sorry mean

3715
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:15,060
threshold and Order blocks midpoint is

3716
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:17,760
mean threshold any inefficiency or gaps

3717
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,859
midpoint is consequent encroachment

3718
02:30:19,859 --> 02:30:22,200
the mean the mean threshold here if we

3719
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,180
trade through that when we're looking

3720
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:27,000
for you know lower prices and such that

3721
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,760
really bodes well for leaving something

3722
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:33,540
on like a partial but it's Friday so

3723
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:35,399
I've already told you I don't want to

3724
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:37,319
hold anything over Friday into the

3725
02:30:37,319 --> 02:30:38,819
weekend starting up on Sunday because of

3726
02:30:38,819 --> 02:30:40,439
the Gap risk that is available now

3727
02:30:40,439 --> 02:30:42,000
because of everything that's been going

3728
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,040
on in the world so if anything can

3729
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:47,600
happen you know and cause a major

3730
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,040
sentiment shift

3731
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:51,899
where we start trading from where we

3732
02:30:51,899 --> 02:30:55,140
ended trading on Friday so that Gap risk

3733
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:56,340
is not something I'm comfortable with

3734
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:58,560
and you may you may not have that

3735
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:00,600
concern you may be trading with such an

3736
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,040
insignificant amount of money and don't

3737
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:04,500
want to incur a great deal of risk

3738
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,780
and you you are willing to take those

3739
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:07,740
larger

3740
02:31:07,740 --> 02:31:09,240
risks

3741
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:11,640
based on points or Pips

3742
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:13,260
but they won't be so impeccable because

3743
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:14,700
of the the money management they're

3744
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:17,280
using but if I'm taking a trade I'm not

3745
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:19,500
I'm not taking a trade with a micro lot

3746
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,939
you know what I mean I'm done trying to

3747
02:31:20,939 --> 02:31:23,280
take something that has real risk behind

3748
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:26,520
it and it will be much more impactful if

3749
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:29,939
I'm wrong and I absorb a gap that is

3750
02:31:29,939 --> 02:31:32,220
adverse to my position that I held over

3751
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:33,479
the weekend

3752
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:35,760
so that's why I'm saying it's

3753
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:38,520
better to be a day trader right now than

3754
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:40,439
there ever Go's been so we have a

3755
02:31:40,439 --> 02:31:45,060
Confluence of a negative 2.5 level on

3756
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:46,740
the FIB based on this price swing and

3757
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:48,180
again why am I using this price swing

3758
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:50,580
here because this is a trigger

3759
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:52,800
it's occurring up to a level where we

3760
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:55,620
want to see it being re respected as

3761
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:57,120
resistance which is the low end of that

3762
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:58,979
old weekly Gap

3763
02:31:58,979 --> 02:32:01,319
it's during the time of day New York

3764
02:32:01,319 --> 02:32:03,060
open where continuations would form

3765
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:05,040
because the logic is we've already

3766
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:06,660
formed a high today

3767
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:09,840
we're trusting okay how do you know ICT

3768
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:11,700
how do you know it's not going to keep

3769
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:14,700
going that's why you use a stop loss for

3770
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:17,640
remember I said it's a 70 likelihood if

3771
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:19,439
you have the narrative on side that

3772
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:20,880
means you pick the right direction on

3773
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:22,560
the weekly chart sometimes I get it

3774
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:24,240
wrong I I get stopped out folks I mean

3775
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:25,859
I've shared where I've gotten stopped

3776
02:32:25,859 --> 02:32:27,960
out you've seen where my winning trades

3777
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:29,399
stopped me out and I don't get the full

3778
02:32:29,399 --> 02:32:30,479
run

3779
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:31,800
like I don't know why you're acting like

3780
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:34,920
I don't show it I show it and most of

3781
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:36,060
you are ignoring the fact that I'm

3782
02:32:36,060 --> 02:32:36,720
telling you what's going to happen

3783
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:38,520
beforehand and you're not using it to

3784
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:40,800
study it real time when I'm pointing to

3785
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,540
it in advance are you going through your

3786
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:43,979
charts and looking at it like this are

3787
02:32:43,979 --> 02:32:45,300
you marking up your charts like this

3788
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:46,920
this is a perfect example what I'm

3789
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:49,140
telling this you should be doing these

3790
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:50,160
things

3791
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,020
this is what you do when I say back test

3792
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:53,460
I'm not talking about go back in there

3793
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:55,620
and using a Forex tester and testing

3794
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:57,660
what it feels like to be in there

3795
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,340
that I'm not seeing that that's not

3796
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:02,880
useful but that's a mock-up forward walk

3797
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:04,380
test

3798
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:07,319
I'm not suggesting that I'm saying you

3799
02:33:07,319 --> 02:33:08,819
go back and look at all moves and you

3800
02:33:08,819 --> 02:33:11,160
annotate your chart like this and you

3801
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:13,200
save these and in these little areas

3802
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,700
over here you talk about and you

3803
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:17,399
annotate how the hide was formed here at

3804
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:19,500
this time and the continuation in the

3805
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,479
high in the New York session formed here

3806
02:33:21,479 --> 02:33:24,359
and it delivered to a Confluence of

3807
02:33:24,359 --> 02:33:26,760
standard deviation negative 2.5 and

3808
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:30,240
breach the low of the order block

3809
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,700
this level right here is the daily order

3810
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:33,479
block

3811
02:33:33,479 --> 02:33:34,620
first

3812
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:36,720
threshold where that's where you start

3813
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:39,840
to trade as a not soccer trade but

3814
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,000
you think of it as your low hanging

3815
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,640
fruit objective you don't need it to do

3816
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,740
all this you just needed to get here

3817
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:49,439
right there and that's not even your

3818
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:51,540
first partial your first partial would

3819
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:53,580
be something like below here

3820
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:55,920
or at the mean I'm sorry the consequent

3821
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:58,800
approach of this Wick right there

3822
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,380
so mid Pawn that Wick

3823
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:04,500
that low or that low which one do you

3824
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:06,300
choose as your first partial neither one

3825
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:07,819
of them are incorrect

3826
02:34:07,819 --> 02:34:10,200
but you're framing with this is where

3827
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,819
you think that the low hanging fruit

3828
02:34:11,819 --> 02:34:13,500
objective is so that's your initial draw

3829
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:15,600
and then you watch and see once it gets

3830
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:18,180
there you leave a partial on how much

3831
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:19,620
whatever you're willing to hold on to

3832
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:22,080
you have to allow and I'm allowing for

3833
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,060
you as your teacher and Mentor I'm

3834
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:26,399
allowing for you to bring in your

3835
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:28,680
personality to this you're bringing your

3836
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:30,899
own personal touch to this that means

3837
02:34:30,899 --> 02:34:32,460
you decide how much you're going to take

3838
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:34,140
off at your first partial in the

3839
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:35,819
beginning when you're first learning

3840
02:34:35,819 --> 02:34:37,979
take the most off

3841
02:34:37,979 --> 02:34:39,600
because you're going to see many times

3842
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:41,280
you're doing it incorrectly while you're

3843
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,680
learning and that's fine but you can be

3844
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:46,859
happy about being profitable quote

3845
02:34:46,859 --> 02:34:50,399
unquote with your results

3846
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,140
and still be incorrect about what you

3847
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:53,580
thought was going to happen meaning that

3848
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:54,840
if you thought this was going to happen

3849
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:58,020
as I was co-signing on the 13th of June

3850
02:34:58,020 --> 02:34:59,580
I said I think it was going to go down

3851
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:01,740
here

3852
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:03,720
if it would have failed to go below

3853
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:05,939
there and I was talking to you today I

3854
02:35:05,939 --> 02:35:07,859
would be saying well if if it would have

3855
02:35:07,859 --> 02:35:08,760
done that

3856
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:10,380
going below this low or that low here

3857
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:11,760
you would have taken partials and it

3858
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:13,800
wouldn't matter if it went down here so

3859
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,899
that's how your your analysis needs to

3860
02:35:15,899 --> 02:35:19,340
make room for you to be wrong but not un

3861
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:22,020
unprofitable you're always looking for a

3862
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:24,479
way to take something out but there has

3863
02:35:24,479 --> 02:35:26,280
to be predetermined so if you're

3864
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:28,560
anticipating the move from up here and

3865
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,420
going down to this level here

3866
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:33,359
in that range from here

3867
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,819
to here looking left where is the pools

3868
02:35:35,819 --> 02:35:38,040
of liquidity or inefficiencies you can't

3869
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:40,200
use this one because we're all we're

3870
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,899
we're acting on that as a term

3871
02:35:42,899 --> 02:35:44,100
meaning this is what I'm talking about

3872
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,460
by that

3873
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:53,880
all of this movement here is just this

3874
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:55,319
by Sun and balance cell sign efficiency

3875
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:57,960
now has been what is SS's been

3876
02:35:57,960 --> 02:35:59,220
offered to it now

3877
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:01,200
look at the bodies of these candles look

3878
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:02,819
at that candle stopping right there

3879
02:36:02,819 --> 02:36:05,880
after this BS has been repriced

3880
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:08,540
with SS so the down closed candle

3881
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:13,020
now has provided a repricing to this

3882
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:15,300
inefficiency

3883
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:19,080
that starts the framework of this Judas

3884
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,120
swing for the New York open this little

3885
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,100
run from here to here

3886
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:25,140
is power three power three is not

3887
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:27,660
limited to the Daily Candlestick power

3888
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:31,859
three can be utilized in any time frame

3889
02:36:31,859 --> 02:36:34,439
but this Market Per traction this false

3890
02:36:34,439 --> 02:36:36,780
move up to a level which is the low of

3891
02:36:36,780 --> 02:36:39,000
that old weekly fair value got which is

3892
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,040
what I've told you to watch for that

3893
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:43,080
does this give you the signature that

3894
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:44,460
it's likely to go lower you had

3895
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:46,080
confirmation in London

3896
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:48,420
I teach you in this YouTube channel in

3897
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:50,819
my lectures that if you're bearish if

3898
02:36:50,819 --> 02:36:53,520
you see the London High form when you're

3899
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:55,020
bearish and it's breaking down and you

3900
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:57,359
retrace in New York chances are you're

3901
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:00,180
retracing to have a continuation lower

3902
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:03,380
and here you have it

3903
02:37:03,899 --> 02:37:05,580
so you can't use this as a target from

3904
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:07,380
up here you want to see it go at minimum

3905
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:09,240
below that low here and would you be

3906
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:10,920
incorrect by taking the largest portion

3907
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:12,720
off of your first partial if you're

3908
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,220
brand new doing that no you're not wrong

3909
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:15,359
about doing that

3910
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:17,399
you're not getting a lot of movement

3911
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:18,720
you know but you're not trading the

3912
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:21,000
dollar either you're trading euro dollar

3913
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,520
pound dollar Aussie dollar New Zealand

3914
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:26,640
dollar something that out effect but

3915
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:29,280
we're looking for how prices want to go

3916
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,140
down to this level minimum

3917
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:32,819
so you want to take a partial here you

3918
02:37:32,819 --> 02:37:34,020
might want to take a partial below that

3919
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:36,600
blow here and the wick whenever there's

3920
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:40,560
a wick okay if if your position affords

3921
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,760
it always always always always

3922
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:47,640
every single trade I don't care who told

3923
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:49,020
you it's going to go where if it

3924
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:52,859
includes me if the price trades to a

3925
02:37:52,859 --> 02:37:55,380
consequent encroachment of a wick you

3926
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:58,080
must take partials if you're if you're

3927
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:00,300
short just above it because that means

3928
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:02,819
it might trade right to that midpoint of

3929
02:38:02,819 --> 02:38:05,340
that stop on a dime and retrace and

3930
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:08,160
spend some time consolidate or oh all

3931
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:11,040
right just reverse

3932
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:14,280
so consequent encroachment of Wicks and

3933
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:18,660
Tails are imperative partial places to

3934
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:21,180
take partials at so if you're short you

3935
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:22,920
have to factor in that price level and

3936
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,899
the spread so you want to see the

3937
02:38:24,899 --> 02:38:26,340
midpoint of that in a little bit above

3938
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:27,660
it

3939
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:30,000
if it trades down to that level here you

3940
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,040
want to take that as a partial always

3941
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:34,100
always always always always

3942
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:37,200
cast in stone it's never going to be a

3943
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:39,359
deviation from that rule if you are

3944
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:41,399
trading inside of a range meaning this

3945
02:38:41,399 --> 02:38:43,680
High to that Target down here which is

3946
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:46,859
that old daily order block

3947
02:38:46,859 --> 02:38:48,840
that line

3948
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:51,000
is where you think that the low-hanging

3949
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,220
fruit objective is you're not saying

3950
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:55,200
that it can't go lower you're saying

3951
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:56,880
that that's where you're expecting it to

3952
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,700
draw to on the downside it is trying to

3953
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:02,220
get there in your opinion between that

3954
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,620
level in this high you're looking

3955
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,300
through all of this

3956
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:08,220
for inefficiencies and I already

3957
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:10,080
disqualified this one

3958
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:13,080
you have this Gap here okay that's a

3959
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:14,760
real liquidity boy if it if you extend

3960
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:16,740
it forward you can use that as an

3961
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:19,319
objective as a partial

3962
02:39:19,319 --> 02:39:22,859
below this low here but these Wicks

3963
02:39:22,859 --> 02:39:25,319
these Tails okay

3964
02:39:25,319 --> 02:39:26,700
when you have two of them back to back

3965
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:30,060
like that you're taking the longest one

3966
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,220
take the longest one divide it in half

3967
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:34,740
what you're measuring is to close to the

3968
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:37,020
low half of that plus a little bit for

3969
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,160
spread

3970
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,399
when when it gets there

3971
02:39:40,399 --> 02:39:43,380
you'll take a partial we just happen to

3972
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:46,140
happen to have a low here if that low

3973
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:47,460
wasn't here and it was just a wick it

3974
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,319
would be even further reason for you to

3975
02:39:49,319 --> 02:39:51,540
want to take a partial there

3976
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:53,399
I have learned

3977
02:39:53,399 --> 02:39:56,520
many times when I held onto trades that

3978
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:59,280
didn't go to my objectives

3979
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:02,460
these Tails or Wicks were always the

3980
02:40:02,460 --> 02:40:04,740
culprit that I didn't notice in my first

3981
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:06,479
few years of trading

3982
02:40:06,479 --> 02:40:08,100
and it's the consequent approach in the

3983
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:10,140
midpoint of that where the algorithm

3984
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,120
comes back down to it and doesn't need

3985
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:13,560
to go back down here

3986
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:15,479
it just goes enough into that Wick to

3987
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:18,479
upset any liquidity

3988
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:20,280
and then ultimately it would reverse if

3989
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:21,960
I'm wrong so that's the reason why I'm

3990
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:24,120
teaching you that whenever you have a a

3991
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:27,060
wick or a tail inside of the range that

3992
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:28,740
you're trading in and you're expecting

3993
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:32,640
that range to be you know broken out

3994
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:35,040
you're anticipating that breakout but

3995
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,920
you can't ignore any of these

3996
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:42,300
these Wicks because many times they can

3997
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:45,420
completely reverse you and run your

3998
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:46,800
run your stop out if you've trailed it

3999
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,960
or completely reverse on your initial um

4000
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:50,760
stop loss

4001
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:51,960
so

4002
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:55,920
entry at New York open at a time between

4003
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:57,720
seven o'clock and nine o'clock

4004
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:00,120
at a level at a price that's been

4005
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:01,859
determined and told to you on the 13th

4006
02:41:01,859 --> 02:41:03,000
of June

4007
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:06,180
what level the low of the inefficiency

4008
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:08,220
and the middle or consequent encroaching

4009
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:12,300
of the inefficiency time button open New

4010
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:14,939
York open price consequent correction of

4011
02:41:14,939 --> 02:41:18,180
the gap lower the gap

4012
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:20,700
all other factors being there the market

4013
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:23,760
starts breaks once this low is broken we

4014
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,920
don't know if it's going to go down here

4015
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:27,240
we don't even know if it's going to go

4016
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:29,340
here we're trusting that it's going to

4017
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:31,080
go there which is why you have a stop

4018
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:33,240
loss if we knew

4019
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:35,460
with absolute assertion that we're going

4020
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:38,340
to see it it's not going to fail we

4021
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:40,979
would never need to use a stop loss

4022
02:41:40,979 --> 02:41:43,500
so you have to trade with managing risk

4023
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:45,600
and the stop loss is essential for you

4024
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:48,540
to be able to do that so we measure how

4025
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:50,520
we trade once we take that low out does

4026
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:51,899
it do it energetically I would say

4027
02:41:51,899 --> 02:41:54,120
that's the energetic

4028
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:56,399
the next candle we open here

4029
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:59,700
best opening when this I'm sorry to open

4030
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:02,460
here the market trades up

4031
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:07,200
into the range of this high and this low

4032
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:09,840
essentially about half of it

4033
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:12,540
when we see that the next candle we want

4034
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:16,200
to see it break lower and treat this

4035
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:19,040
as an order block

4036
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:22,979
we open rally up trade down we trade

4037
02:42:22,979 --> 02:42:24,300
through it

4038
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:28,560
it does not need to close below it

4039
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:31,439
mean threshold is important when we're

4040
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:33,060
trading down to an order block for

4041
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:35,040
targeting purposes and or continuation

4042
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:38,160
if it closes below mean threshold that's

4043
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:39,960
an indication that it's likely not a

4044
02:42:39,960 --> 02:42:41,399
promise it's an indication that it's

4045
02:42:41,399 --> 02:42:44,040
likely to continue moving lower

4046
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:46,979
but if we're seeing a new brand new up

4047
02:42:46,979 --> 02:42:49,620
close candle in a Cell program this

4048
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:51,960
target here is our objective remember

4049
02:42:51,960 --> 02:42:54,240
that's the daily bullish order block the

4050
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,280
full range of that order block is shaded

4051
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:58,020
in yellow

4052
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:01,140
so consequent encroachment I'm sorry the

4053
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:04,260
mean threshold of that order block

4054
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:07,700
I'm just going to eyeball it here

4055
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,800
is

4056
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:21,660
102.565 so

4057
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:23,640
we went through that easily and then

4058
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:25,380
traded outside of the

4059
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:27,359
the range of that order block so now

4060
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:29,760
since we've done this this level here

4061
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:32,819
mean threshold now becomes critical

4062
02:43:32,819 --> 02:43:36,420
and we would rather see it not

4063
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:39,060
trade up into

4064
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:41,460
oops

4065
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:45,080
we don't want to see this range

4066
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:46,979
like this

4067
02:43:46,979 --> 02:43:49,859
didn't do that right

4068
02:43:49,859 --> 02:43:51,840
let's do it like this

4069
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,880
we want to see this portion of the the

4070
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:57,120
range be Revisited if I can get it all

4071
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,899
right I wanted that

4072
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:03,899
and that was the high end of that

4073
02:44:03,899 --> 02:44:05,819
right here this was the high older block

4074
02:44:05,819 --> 02:44:07,260
this is the low this is the mean

4075
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:09,840
threshold this section of PA

4076
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:13,080
if it's going to continue it's best for

4077
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:14,700
it not to trade back up into this area

4078
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:15,660
here

4079
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:18,000
and because of that I would treat this

4080
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,120
as an area of a fairway Gap that I want

4081
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,380
to see stay open

4082
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:24,780
so say say this was like the euro dollar

4083
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:27,960
or it was the es or NQ or something on

4084
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:29,760
trading I don't trade the dollar Index I

4085
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:31,620
use it as a barometer

4086
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:33,120
everything I'm showing you here should

4087
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,859
be a mirror image on Euro it should be a

4088
02:44:34,859 --> 02:44:37,080
mirror image on pound dollar

4089
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,540
but because of this idea of the order

4090
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:42,300
block and now because we went below the

4091
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:44,580
mean threshold of it

4092
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:47,280
I don't want to see the upper portion of

4093
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,920
that order block now retraded to it can

4094
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:53,040
it's this best if it doesn't now because

4095
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:55,620
I've encapsulated that relative to the

4096
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:58,140
mean threshold or midpoint up to the

4097
02:44:58,140 --> 02:45:00,240
highest point of that daily order block

4098
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:02,280
this section of PA when I'm

4099
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,140
looking at price now you can see right

4100
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,939
away while I'm trading on a one minute

4101
02:45:05,939 --> 02:45:08,220
and five minute chart imagine me trying

4102
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:10,319
to do all of this annotation and justify

4103
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:12,540
why I'm doing it and still watching

4104
02:45:12,540 --> 02:45:14,760
price managing the position it's

4105
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:17,160
impossible but these are all the things

4106
02:45:17,160 --> 02:45:19,200
that it's in my mind that I'm referring

4107
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,960
to and weighing out when I'm moving a

4108
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:23,880
stop when I'm not moving a stop when I'm

4109
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:26,100
taking a partial when I say I want to

4110
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,140
see a certain range stay open like this

4111
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,720
would be a a gap

4112
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,580
you will all would see that and clearly

4113
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:36,300
see that as a fair Vegas right there

4114
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:39,960
this low and this high that one candle

4115
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:41,760
here that's a city

4116
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:44,040
I wouldn't want to see it trade up any

4117
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:46,380
now it can trade up to the midpoint

4118
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:47,939
which is mean threshold

4119
02:45:47,939 --> 02:45:49,979
go just above this candle's high and

4120
02:45:49,979 --> 02:45:51,359
then resume going lower that would be

4121
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:53,399
institutional order flow entry drill

4122
02:45:53,399 --> 02:45:56,580
trusting that this is not needed to be

4123
02:45:56,580 --> 02:45:59,399
traded to or up into this area here as I

4124
02:45:59,399 --> 02:46:01,560
had indicated oops

4125
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:05,660
from this high down to the midpoint

4126
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:07,439
so again you don't know order blocks so

4127
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:10,200
stop trying to teach them but the um

4128
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:11,700
the point is is

4129
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:15,660
we trade down okay we trade down into

4130
02:46:15,660 --> 02:46:18,479
targets

4131
02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:22,260
until we get to time

4132
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:23,819
the high that they formed in London

4133
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:25,260
opened exactly how I teach the second

4134
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:27,300
final time if you're bearish the high is

4135
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:28,380
going to form between two o'clock and

4136
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,280
five o'clock in the morning New York

4137
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:31,500
local time

4138
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:33,720
if that is true

4139
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:36,060
New York session

4140
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:38,160
will have a high probability of

4141
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:41,040
continuation of the same direction that

4142
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,140
London already establishes that means

4143
02:46:43,140 --> 02:46:44,939
the highest formed in London

4144
02:46:44,939 --> 02:46:47,160
we have a price area that we want to see

4145
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:48,479
respected we've already worked the

4146
02:46:48,479 --> 02:46:51,300
midpoint of that old Gap the low is now

4147
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:52,680
the sensitive price point that's the

4148
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:54,300
level of price

4149
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:56,580
but it has to be traded to at the time

4150
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:58,620
of day that the algorithm will refer to

4151
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:01,439
for new delivery new delivery is a lower

4152
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:03,000
low in the day

4153
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,340
this protraction higher up into New York

4154
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:08,700
open and the time and price is meeting

4155
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:11,100
right here then we have this

4156
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:12,960
acceleration to the downside

4157
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:18,000
until we get to when London close starts

4158
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,300
at 10 A.M now at 10 A.M you're watching

4159
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:25,080
does price hit your target or multiple

4160
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:27,359
targets if it does now you're in a

4161
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:28,680
position where you could potentially see

4162
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:31,280
a market reversal profile London close

4163
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:34,560
generally makes the extreme end

4164
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:37,140
of the day so if we see the high of the

4165
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:39,180
day form in London the low of the day

4166
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:41,399
forms generally in this little time

4167
02:47:41,399 --> 02:47:44,040
window here between 10 o'clock and noon

4168
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:46,560
don't take my word for it go back and

4169
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:48,600
look at your data look at your old moves

4170
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:51,600
your charts every single day would take

4171
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,340
seven of those are here get that out

4172
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:55,439
there you should have the minimum of

4173
02:47:55,439 --> 02:47:57,180
just that

4174
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:58,560
just that

4175
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:01,560
that in itself and all The annotation

4176
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:03,180
areas over here that you can fill in

4177
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:04,979
with all your observations and you

4178
02:48:04,979 --> 02:48:07,140
cheerlead yourself and you say it was

4179
02:48:07,140 --> 02:48:10,020
amazing to see how the level I expected

4180
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:12,420
on the 13th of June to be respected as

4181
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:14,220
resistance which is that old weekly

4182
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:16,140
inversion for everybody being respected

4183
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:18,540
here and then it started this framework

4184
02:48:18,540 --> 02:48:20,640
in the London open cream high today and

4185
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:22,020
it traded all the way down to just like

4186
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:23,880
I teach on a YouTube listen

4187
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:26,160
this is all in videos

4188
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:28,979
all in videos years and years and years

4189
02:48:28,979 --> 02:48:31,319
and years of it and the rules have never

4190
02:48:31,319 --> 02:48:34,080
changed it's always the same stuff the

4191
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:37,260
algorithm is not changing it's not it's

4192
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:40,200
not it hasn't it won't period what will

4193
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:43,020
happen that causes it to stop working we

4194
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:45,180
are not trading anymore we won't be

4195
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:46,560
permitted to trade anymore there you go

4196
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:49,439
that's how it ends so you got a bigger

4197
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:51,720
problem you know than than worrying

4198
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:53,040
about whether it's going to work or stop

4199
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,140
working if that happens so as long as

4200
02:48:55,140 --> 02:48:56,819
there's markets being offered to trade

4201
02:48:56,819 --> 02:48:58,800
this logic is always going to be used

4202
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:03,240
period in the story rest

4203
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:06,479
all right so now I'm gonna take all this

4204
02:49:06,479 --> 02:49:08,220
information here

4205
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:10,740
and I want you to keep that in mind and

4206
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,580
we're going to go back up into a

4207
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:17,479
daily chart

4208
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,979
and we're going to segue over to and

4209
02:49:19,979 --> 02:49:21,240
then beautiful look at that how it looks

4210
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:22,680
on a daily chart now

4211
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:25,200
completely random

4212
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:28,040
euro dollar

4213
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:31,260
we'll take our next break at

4214
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:32,880
11 30.

4215
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,859
it'll just be a five minute break in

4216
02:49:34,859 --> 02:49:37,080
case you're wondering I got a p-i-c-t

4217
02:49:37,080 --> 02:49:39,359
when can I take a break

4218
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:42,300
so here is you're a dollar and if you

4219
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:44,040
remember I was talking to you about how

4220
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:47,100
on the 13th I said that there's a small

4221
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:48,420
little Gap in here

4222
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:50,040
and then we have this order block right

4223
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:51,300
there

4224
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,819
okay so I encapsulate that entire range

4225
02:49:53,819 --> 02:49:55,920
of the order Block in that area here

4226
02:49:55,920 --> 02:50:00,060
yesterday we traded up into it there and

4227
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:01,760
then today we had this

4228
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,960
gargantuan move outside of it which is

4229
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:05,280
supported by the weakness that we've

4230
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:07,319
seen in a dollar Index so I'm not going

4231
02:50:07,319 --> 02:50:08,760
to spend a great deal of time going

4232
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:10,140
through this one because everything I

4233
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:11,819
just showed you in dollar

4234
02:50:11,819 --> 02:50:13,859
will be a mirror image or should be a

4235
02:50:13,859 --> 02:50:15,660
mirror image of everything you see here

4236
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:17,280
in Europe so we're just going to drop

4237
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:19,080
down into an alley chart because a lot

4238
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:21,420
of things I want to cover and if I'm not

4239
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:22,740
careful we could be into this thing

4240
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:24,180
until eight o'clock tonight

4241
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:25,800
and while I make

4242
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:27,240
allowances for that because of energy

4243
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:29,280
God could do it my wife probably won't

4244
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:31,040
permit that

4245
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,780
I want to stay married folks okay all

4246
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:34,740
right

4247
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:36,960
um yeah here's your hourly chart and we

4248
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:38,520
were looking for a price wanting to

4249
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:41,040
eventually gravitate from the 13th we

4250
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,080
want to see it gravitate up into that

4251
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:46,760
Gap let me scrub it over here

4252
02:50:53,939 --> 02:50:58,319
so it's this high and that low okay one

4253
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:00,120
of the things that I would counsel you

4254
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:01,620
to do if you're going to be doing a lot

4255
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:03,240
of annotations and journaling which is

4256
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:05,580
what I'm trying to cultivate in you as a

4257
02:51:05,580 --> 02:51:06,780
student

4258
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:09,359
whenever you anchor your annotations and

4259
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:10,979
lines on from the HTF

4260
02:51:10,979 --> 02:51:12,479
charts when they drop down the lower

4261
02:51:12,479 --> 02:51:15,300
time frame like I'm showing you here

4262
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,899
the

4263
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:19,380
the highs you want to make sure they

4264
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:22,260
toggle onto the very specific levels so

4265
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:23,939
that way it makes your charts near I'm

4266
02:51:23,939 --> 02:51:24,960
saying that because I'm obsessively

4267
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:26,880
compulsive it probably may not be a big

4268
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,200
deal to you but if you don't have that

4269
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:29,700
in the beginning stages it would be easy

4270
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:32,760
for you to gloss over key levels and

4271
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:34,859
where they were referencing from you

4272
02:51:34,859 --> 02:51:37,740
know respective times of the day

4273
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:38,760
and if you're going to learn you're

4274
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:40,439
going to do it right otherwise you just

4275
02:51:40,439 --> 02:51:42,240
you know waste an opportunity

4276
02:51:42,240 --> 02:51:47,240
so we have on the 13th which is here

4277
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:53,600
Market drops down takes out SS

4278
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:56,580
what is this high right here

4279
02:51:56,580 --> 02:52:00,080
last up close candle what is that

4280
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:03,560
it's not a breaker

4281
02:52:14,939 --> 02:52:18,779
what is the what is the purpose or

4282
02:52:18,779 --> 02:52:22,380
function of a breaker

4283
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:23,939
mitigation

4284
02:52:23,939 --> 02:52:27,300
so a breaker if it was a bullish breaker

4285
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:30,000
we would see a hot I'm sorry a low a

4286
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,279
high and a lower low than that low here

4287
02:52:32,279 --> 02:52:34,740
but we're not seeing that we see a high

4288
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:38,399
I'm sorry low high low a higher low

4289
02:52:38,399 --> 02:52:40,920
so it didn't go lower here so that makes

4290
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:42,240
this High here

4291
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:45,319
a mitigation block

4292
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:48,840
similar in in scope but the definition

4293
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:51,000
of what makes it a mitigation block is

4294
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:54,899
that distinctive feature

4295
02:52:54,899 --> 02:52:57,840
so if you take that range here

4296
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:00,380
time

4297
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:06,479
perfect

4298
02:53:06,479 --> 02:53:08,640
what's the low of this candle here look

4299
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:09,720
right

4300
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:12,600
here okay upper left hand corner what is

4301
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:15,920
the low of that candle

4302
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:19,319
1.07746 that's the low of this candle

4303
02:53:19,319 --> 02:53:20,220
here

4304
02:53:20,220 --> 02:53:21,840
what's the low of this candle right

4305
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:24,020
there

4306
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:27,660
1.07741

4307
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,300
so it respects it

4308
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:31,859
colors outside the line just a little

4309
02:53:31,859 --> 02:53:32,760
bit

4310
02:53:32,760 --> 02:53:35,760
rallies but look at the bodies

4311
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:37,200
but did I tell you about the Blicks

4312
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:38,700
versus the bodies

4313
02:53:38,700 --> 02:53:40,680
the Wicks do the damage that means you

4314
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:42,479
have to allow for these little Mohawks

4315
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:44,760
okay I got a lot of questions about

4316
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:47,040
folks saw that video where I was trading

4317
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,740
the index Futures and I annotated

4318
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:52,380
where it was trading down outside of the

4319
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:54,120
FVG

4320
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:56,640
and anytime it does that

4321
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,140
the

4322
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:00,060
my mindset is

4323
02:54:00,060 --> 02:54:02,460
it's allowing for spread

4324
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:05,460
so I don't lose my mind if it just makes

4325
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:07,920
a little small little Wick outside of a

4326
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:10,080
level or if it's outside of a fair Vega

4327
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:13,260
if it's like one tick or two ticks and

4328
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:14,460
it immediately comes back inside the

4329
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:16,800
range I'm comfortable with that

4330
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:18,960
you might be freaking out if you're

4331
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:20,040
trying to trade before you're supposed

4332
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:22,439
to be and you're you're prepared to do

4333
02:54:22,439 --> 02:54:24,540
it you'll get scared out of the trade

4334
02:54:24,540 --> 02:54:27,720
or not trust the level where if you

4335
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:30,240
watch when I'm doing executions I'm

4336
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:31,620
allowing for these things and many times

4337
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:33,180
I'm annotating it right then real time

4338
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,979
saying you know this is a mohawk if I

4339
02:54:34,979 --> 02:54:36,300
ever see if you ever see a mohawk or

4340
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:38,460
hear me talk about a mohawk it's just

4341
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:40,800
when the PA has a little tiny

4342
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:43,020
little movement with a wick that's just

4343
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:45,120
outside the the lines that I would see

4344
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:48,180
as if it was everything perfect

4345
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:51,479
like no deviations from the actual high

4346
02:54:51,479 --> 02:54:53,279
or low or the range that's defining an

4347
02:54:53,279 --> 02:54:54,420
imbalance

4348
02:54:54,420 --> 02:54:56,340
it can go it can color outside the lines

4349
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:58,439
and it's completely permissible it does

4350
02:54:58,439 --> 02:55:00,600
not upset my expectation it doesn't

4351
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:03,180
unsettle me and you get used to seeing

4352
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:05,100
that when you do these annotations you

4353
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:07,140
trust yourself and your observation and

4354
02:55:07,140 --> 02:55:08,819
reading price when you see these things

4355
02:55:08,819 --> 02:55:12,240
repeating over and over and over again

4356
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:15,180
so anyway that's a mitigation block

4357
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:19,200
in the market accelerates during the

4358
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:21,240
New York I'm sorry the London open Kill

4359
02:55:21,240 --> 02:55:23,819
Zone on the 14th at 2 A.M

4360
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:25,140
so we had

4361
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:27,840
SS in here we drop down to it

4362
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:30,000
that's your Judas swing the market then

4363
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,040
rallies quickly up into the levels I

4364
02:55:32,040 --> 02:55:34,260
told you on the 13th it would do all the

4365
02:55:34,260 --> 02:55:36,899
way up to the high here today and

4366
02:55:36,899 --> 02:55:39,600
through it just like we saw happen on

4367
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:42,180
the dollar Index so if you are a euro

4368
02:55:42,180 --> 02:55:43,500
dollar Trader

4369
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:45,960
okay you want to have

4370
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:50,180
a reference between that and

4371
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:52,979
we're looking at the dollar Index with

4372
02:55:52,979 --> 02:55:55,140
it so

4373
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:57,720
you want to constantly be referring to

4374
02:55:57,720 --> 02:55:59,819
what you're seeing on the market that

4375
02:55:59,819 --> 02:56:01,560
you're Trading

4376
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:05,220
versus the dollar Index

4377
02:56:05,220 --> 02:56:08,220
so everything you're looking at in price

4378
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:11,640
for your Market of study or Trading

4379
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:14,220
you're constantly getting feedback in

4380
02:56:14,220 --> 02:56:17,939
relationship to the dollar Index so if

4381
02:56:17,939 --> 02:56:20,040
you're looking for the dollar Index to

4382
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:21,899
go lower

4383
02:56:21,899 --> 02:56:25,740
and you feel like you're you just can't

4384
02:56:25,740 --> 02:56:27,359
hold on to a trade that's running for

4385
02:56:27,359 --> 02:56:29,520
you and you have a partial on and you

4386
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:31,740
just if you're traded with real money

4387
02:56:31,740 --> 02:56:32,840
you know exactly what I'm talking about

4388
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:35,939
it's stressful to be in a winning trade

4389
02:56:35,939 --> 02:56:37,380
like that we just don't know when to

4390
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:38,939
close it you don't want to close it too

4391
02:56:38,939 --> 02:56:40,920
soon because if it runs it's just going

4392
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:41,819
to keep

4393
02:56:41,819 --> 02:56:43,979
reminding you you just got out on a

4394
02:56:43,979 --> 02:56:45,779
motion you should just held on to it or

4395
02:56:45,779 --> 02:56:47,939
put a stop loss at a point where you can

4396
02:56:47,939 --> 02:56:50,340
be comfortable with it you move up half

4397
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:52,200
of the open

4398
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:53,760
profit and just leave it there if it

4399
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:55,740
stops you who cares because you've taken

4400
02:56:55,740 --> 02:56:58,200
a larger portion of already in partials

4401
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:01,800
but the way you beat that uncertainty or

4402
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:04,140
that nagging feeling of I don't know

4403
02:57:04,140 --> 02:57:05,880
when to get out when to get out you're

4404
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:08,100
constantly referring to the dollar index

4405
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:09,960
in relationship to your Market of Choice

4406
02:57:09,960 --> 02:57:11,819
so if you're if you're trading euro

4407
02:57:11,819 --> 02:57:13,680
dollar and it trades through the high

4408
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:15,120
end of the order block here and it

4409
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:16,560
trades to the low the order block over

4410
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:19,080
here you're already looking for

4411
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:21,540
signatures to support it complete runoff

4412
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:23,340
and keep on going lower

4413
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:25,680
but when we get time of day like we have

4414
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:27,920
here

4415
02:57:32,279 --> 02:57:35,279
as soon as we enter in underline clothes

4416
02:57:35,279 --> 02:57:37,800
you have you have to have the the

4417
02:57:37,800 --> 02:57:39,540
majority of your trade off

4418
02:57:39,540 --> 02:57:42,000
you have to number one it's Friday two

4419
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,819
London close is generally the time when

4420
02:57:44,819 --> 02:57:46,319
it makes the opposite end of the daily

4421
02:57:46,319 --> 02:57:48,779
range so we have the London High forming

4422
02:57:48,779 --> 02:57:50,580
here the high of the day

4423
02:57:50,580 --> 02:57:52,859
we had all this

4424
02:57:52,859 --> 02:57:55,979
SS delivery and over delivering

4425
02:57:55,979 --> 02:57:57,420
in terms of what we were expecting which

4426
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:59,220
is wonderful

4427
02:57:59,220 --> 02:58:01,140
but when we entered a time of 10 o'clock

4428
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:03,600
to noon New York local time

4429
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:06,180
generally a lot of the volume for index

4430
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:08,819
I'm not sorry for Forex and currency

4431
02:58:08,819 --> 02:58:11,880
trading starts to dry up between 10 and

4432
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:13,920
noon and later in the afternoon yes you

4433
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:15,540
might see these little fluctuations but

4434
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,399
I'm not a fan of afternoon trading and

4435
02:58:17,399 --> 02:58:20,340
currencies like I'm not a fan of it the

4436
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:22,260
bulk of the volume is going to be

4437
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:24,240
encapsulated between two o'clock in the

4438
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:27,660
morning and noon local time in New York

4439
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:29,819
so

4440
02:58:29,819 --> 02:58:32,580
the way I just ignore any potential

4441
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:36,240
blow-off moves is I have rules and I

4442
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:39,300
have to have closed up shop sometime

4443
02:58:39,300 --> 02:58:41,340
between 10 o'clock in the morning and

4444
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:44,340
noon New York local time

4445
02:58:44,340 --> 02:58:46,859
especially if we've had targets you know

4446
02:58:46,859 --> 02:58:48,600
hit in these multiple targets have been

4447
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:49,680
hit

4448
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:52,020
if you need to leave a very small

4449
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:53,520
portion on

4450
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:56,340
then it's okay to do that but just know

4451
02:58:56,340 --> 02:58:57,720
that it's probably going to stop you out

4452
02:58:57,720 --> 02:59:00,479
and it's okay because you're holding a

4453
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:03,060
small portion on but if it runs it will

4454
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:05,880
satisfy that I need to be in there in

4455
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:07,439
case it runs but you're still going to

4456
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:08,819
regret not having the full position on

4457
02:59:08,819 --> 02:59:09,899
so you're always going to be wrong in

4458
02:59:09,899 --> 02:59:11,580
that regard and that's why I'm telling

4459
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:13,680
you my exits I'm never I'm never

4460
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:14,880
satisfied with that I don't have a

4461
02:59:14,880 --> 02:59:17,340
strategy that satisfies me every single

4462
02:59:17,340 --> 02:59:19,319
time I think a tree but I can find

4463
02:59:19,319 --> 02:59:21,600
profitability in every trade I'm getting

4464
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:23,520
into because there's partials always

4465
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:24,779
available

4466
02:59:24,779 --> 02:59:26,340
and

4467
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:28,620
that part is a personal aspect of

4468
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:30,660
trading that I teach and make allowance

4469
02:59:30,660 --> 02:59:32,700
for you might not understand that

4470
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:34,740
allowance as being a factor coming into

4471
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:35,700
this

4472
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:37,859
but that's what you're doing when you

4473
02:59:37,859 --> 02:59:39,540
take my information and Concepts and

4474
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:42,240
they make it makes your model it's

4475
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:44,939
Uniquely Yours how you engage with price

4476
02:59:44,939 --> 02:59:46,620
action what you're comfortable with

4477
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:49,140
you're never going to outside trade

4478
02:59:49,140 --> 02:59:50,399
outside these parameters that you

4479
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:51,899
defined for yourself

4480
02:59:51,899 --> 02:59:53,220
how do you start there what what

4481
02:59:53,220 --> 02:59:54,779
parameters and what framework do you

4482
02:59:54,779 --> 02:59:57,120
apply these right here which is time and

4483
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:59,939
price Theory

4484
02:59:59,939 --> 03:00:02,640
this is not form fitted today this is

4485
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:05,160
exactly how I teach it my students have

4486
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:07,439
seen these things for years

4487
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:09,359
you're going to see these things for the

4488
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:10,620
rest of your life if you study price

4489
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:12,660
action and you trade you'll see these

4490
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:14,399
things repeat every week it happens

4491
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:17,100
every single week which is why am I My

4492
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:19,740
slogan is this every week every day and

4493
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:22,020
it won't stop because this is the

4494
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:24,420
marketplace

4495
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:27,540
all right so let's go into

4496
03:00:27,540 --> 03:00:30,660
[Music]

4497
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:33,680
five minute chart

4498
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:40,280
and take a look at how we traded up into

4499
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:42,660
[Music]

4500
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:46,140
on the 15th we had SS here

4501
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:48,240
then we drop down

4502
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:52,080
classic signature of London open

4503
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:55,399
is a stop run

4504
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:59,279
London opened classically seeks sell

4505
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:01,620
side or BS liquidity you don't

4506
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:03,359
have to have the confidence

4507
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:07,200
to go in and buy the sell stops I can my

4508
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:08,580
students have learned how to do that but

4509
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:10,979
it's a very very hard thing to learn

4510
03:01:10,979 --> 03:01:14,580
because you have to see years of this

4511
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:16,800
type of stuff to desensitize you

4512
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:20,340
it's easier for you to wait for this run

4513
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:21,540
here

4514
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:24,300
and then judge does it have displacement

4515
03:01:24,300 --> 03:01:27,060
higher

4516
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:28,979
swing High

4517
03:01:28,979 --> 03:01:32,300
after take stops

4518
03:01:32,660 --> 03:01:35,220
it drops down into it here

4519
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:38,100
rally we want to see energetic run once

4520
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:41,520
it clears this high does it do it yes in

4521
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:44,220
itself at this time of day is 355. what

4522
03:01:44,220 --> 03:01:46,939
time of day is that

4523
03:01:51,680 --> 03:01:53,700
between two o'clock in the morning and

4524
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:55,740
five o'clock in the morning this Fair

4525
03:01:55,740 --> 03:01:58,200
bag you got right here is the

4526
03:01:58,200 --> 03:02:02,359
Silver-Bullet for Euro for today

4527
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:04,319
you only need this love right here to

4528
03:02:04,319 --> 03:02:06,680
trade to

4529
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:11,240
there what time is that 4 20.

4530
03:02:11,279 --> 03:02:13,620
sorry just a joke

4531
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:15,540
some of you probably won't get that no I

4532
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:17,340
don't smoke weed

4533
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:19,680
but there's your Silver-Bullet for

4534
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:20,819
London open

4535
03:02:20,819 --> 03:02:24,000
and it rallies up to what the low of

4536
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,220
that FVG I told you on the

4537
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:30,120
13th of June that is what what is that

4538
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:34,439
that is your low hanging fruit objective

4539
03:02:34,439 --> 03:02:36,600
you don't need it to go all the way up

4540
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:38,640
to mean threshold which is half of that

4541
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:40,080
shaded area in purple which is the order

4542
03:02:40,080 --> 03:02:41,939
block on the daily chart

4543
03:02:41,939 --> 03:02:44,100
you don't need to go there it can

4544
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:46,080
but you are framing on the basis of

4545
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,779
getting into that fairbanka

4546
03:02:48,779 --> 03:02:50,700
now why am I not using the low of the

4547
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:53,399
order block because that Gap is there

4548
03:02:53,399 --> 03:02:55,920
the inefficiency takes precedence over

4549
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:57,979
the order block

4550
03:02:57,979 --> 03:03:01,140
yes the inefficiency

4551
03:03:01,140 --> 03:03:05,580
takes precedence over the order block

4552
03:03:05,580 --> 03:03:07,859
this is where you would see it reach for

4553
03:03:07,859 --> 03:03:10,620
minimum does it react there

4554
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:14,100
sure does trades back down in to what

4555
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:17,000
what you're trading into

4556
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,080
a low

4557
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:24,560
High lower low what does that make this

4558
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:27,000
a bullish breaker

4559
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,859
extend it in time

4560
03:03:28,859 --> 03:03:32,060
what time of day is that

4561
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:35,939
New York open Killzone seven o'clock in

4562
03:03:35,939 --> 03:03:37,500
the morning to nine o'clock in the

4563
03:03:37,500 --> 03:03:39,359
morning there's your little sweet spot

4564
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:40,819
what does it do

4565
03:03:40,819 --> 03:03:44,340
rallies how high can it go well we have

4566
03:03:44,340 --> 03:03:46,260
to determine a fulcrum point

4567
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:48,540
fulcrum point is here why is that

4568
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:50,100
important

4569
03:03:50,100 --> 03:03:52,560
if it runs through this High we can

4570
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:54,060
start doing measurements in form of

4571
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:55,560
standard deviation so we can take that

4572
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:56,340
low

4573
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,840
project it up this High here

4574
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,580
standard deviation negative two

4575
03:04:02,580 --> 03:04:04,319
negative one and a half

4576
03:04:04,319 --> 03:04:07,380
one this is a measured move okay so from

4577
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:11,040
this low to that high these classic ABCD

4578
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:13,560
type thing or measured move

4579
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:15,899
and that's it right here

4580
03:04:15,899 --> 03:04:18,180
you want to absolutely have the lines

4581
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:20,160
portion of your your trade off there

4582
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:21,960
because what else is that in close

4583
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:24,359
proximity to

4584
03:04:24,359 --> 03:04:26,100
the high of the order block remember

4585
03:04:26,100 --> 03:04:28,140
this shaded area here

4586
03:04:28,140 --> 03:04:32,120
the Shaded area is let me drop up into

4587
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:36,359
go up into this

4588
03:04:37,380 --> 03:04:40,080
this up close candle right here

4589
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:43,200
right there right above my cursor that's

4590
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:44,880
what I'm highlighting here the low to

4591
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:46,200
the high of that

4592
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:50,600
that's what I'm showing so back down in

4593
03:04:54,840 --> 03:04:57,859
measuring that low

4594
03:04:58,920 --> 03:05:00,960
to high and this is the fulcrum Point

4595
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:03,479
meaning that when price trades to it and

4596
03:05:03,479 --> 03:05:04,859
through it it has to go through it

4597
03:05:04,859 --> 03:05:05,880
before you can get any of these

4598
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:07,140
measurements

4599
03:05:07,140 --> 03:05:11,040
that's the measured move

4600
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:12,720
Lions portion of the trade should be

4601
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:13,920
taken off there

4602
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:15,600
because it's in close proximity to the

4603
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:17,399
high of that order block it could very

4604
03:05:17,399 --> 03:05:19,740
easily stop there and consolidate into

4605
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:22,200
the rest of the day and then continue on

4606
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:24,840
Sunday into Monday

4607
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:28,080
but allowing for continuation when it

4608
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,279
gets to the high of the order block you

4609
03:05:29,279 --> 03:05:32,540
need to consider taking partial there

4610
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:35,520
negative one and a half and two that's

4611
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:38,160
two times this move here whenever you

4612
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:41,100
get that type of move that's very very

4613
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:43,920
extended so stand two standard

4614
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:46,920
deviations I teach in

4615
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:49,319
mentorship that

4616
03:05:49,319 --> 03:05:51,600
two standard deviations of like the

4617
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:53,899
Asian range or flout or Central Bank

4618
03:05:53,899 --> 03:05:55,979
dealers range attention like digital

4619
03:05:55,979 --> 03:05:58,500
currency hear that Central Bank dealers

4620
03:05:58,500 --> 03:06:00,600
range those

4621
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:03,180
ranges that I use for measuring

4622
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:05,640
protraction and how far a high or low

4623
03:06:05,640 --> 03:06:08,939
can move before it makes it that same

4624
03:06:08,939 --> 03:06:10,680
principle applies here with all price

4625
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:13,260
swings negative two standard deviation

4626
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:16,260
is one of those levels where

4627
03:06:16,260 --> 03:06:18,479
there's a lot of reason for you to be

4628
03:06:18,479 --> 03:06:20,760
wanting to be either out of the trade or

4629
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:23,640
have such a small little piece on

4630
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:24,859
if you're going to leave a runner on

4631
03:06:24,859 --> 03:06:28,380
it's about at that time we usually Peter

4632
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:30,899
out especially if

4633
03:06:30,899 --> 03:06:34,200
we do so when time is met and that being

4634
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:36,060
10 o'clock in the morning New York local

4635
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:39,060
time to noon that's London close so for

4636
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:40,620
your notes especially for the folks that

4637
03:06:40,620 --> 03:06:43,080
are brand new when markets are going

4638
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:45,300
down or we're expecting a daily candle

4639
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:47,520
to be a down closed candle

4640
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:49,439
between two o'clock and five o'clock in

4641
03:06:49,439 --> 03:06:50,760
the morning generally you're going to

4642
03:06:50,760 --> 03:06:52,200
see the high form

4643
03:06:52,200 --> 03:06:54,779
and generally the New York session

4644
03:06:54,779 --> 03:06:55,979
between seven o'clock in the morning

4645
03:06:55,979 --> 03:06:57,120
nine o'clock in the morning New York

4646
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:59,220
local time will create a continuation

4647
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:01,620
pattern now sometimes

4648
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:04,560
there's a reversal of that where London

4649
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:06,779
creates a high sells off and in New York

4650
03:07:06,779 --> 03:07:08,700
runs out to London high but then

4651
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:11,040
reverses and makes the lower close in

4652
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:12,300
the day

4653
03:07:12,300 --> 03:07:15,359
those are always on the heels of a

4654
03:07:15,359 --> 03:07:17,520
higher medium impact news driver

4655
03:07:17,520 --> 03:07:20,160
that's the only time that occurs so how

4656
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:21,540
do you know when the low is not going to

4657
03:07:21,540 --> 03:07:22,680
be taken out or the high is going to be

4658
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:24,120
taken out in London you can trust the

4659
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:26,640
New York session I just told you

4660
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:28,560
man I should have charged money for this

4661
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:30,420
one so we can see there's a lot of

4662
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:32,700
consolidation in here we had a high it

4663
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:35,640
right above it if I was long on Euro

4664
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:37,380
this is running down Equity this is the

4665
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:38,760
principle you see me doing all the time

4666
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:41,819
in trades if I'm long and admittedly I

4667
03:07:41,819 --> 03:07:43,200
was sleeping last night preparing for

4668
03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:44,819
all this so I didn't trade Euro and I

4669
03:07:44,819 --> 03:07:47,399
even trading Forex for a while now

4670
03:07:47,399 --> 03:07:49,260
as soon as it trades about this High you

4671
03:07:49,260 --> 03:07:51,899
want to be taking parcel and exiting

4672
03:07:51,899 --> 03:07:53,580
your position it's offset distribution

4673
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:56,040
and the principle is running down Equity

4674
03:07:56,040 --> 03:07:58,620
that means you're you're selling to buy

4675
03:07:58,620 --> 03:08:01,140
stops you're selling at new highs you're

4676
03:08:01,140 --> 03:08:03,240
buying low and selling High where do you

4677
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:05,160
define High every time it takes out a

4678
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:08,100
swing High when you're long if it's long

4679
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:10,620
in a tooth or it's been going for a long

4680
03:08:10,620 --> 03:08:11,819
time like we did here since eight

4681
03:08:11,819 --> 03:08:12,960
o'clock this morning

4682
03:08:12,960 --> 03:08:14,640
it's

4683
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:17,160
good money practice for you to be

4684
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:18,840
selling every time it makes a new high

4685
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:21,540
if you have position available to do so

4686
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:23,520
in my personal opinion

4687
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:27,439
if you look at what we're seeing here

4688
03:08:29,580 --> 03:08:31,500
do you see how the Euro has made higher

4689
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:33,420
high

4690
03:08:33,420 --> 03:08:35,040
and the dollar didn't make that lower

4691
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:37,200
yet low at the same time

4692
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:40,380
Market symmetry suggests that in a

4693
03:08:40,380 --> 03:08:41,340
perfect world

4694
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:43,560
the US dollar should have made a lower

4695
03:08:43,560 --> 03:08:44,760
low there

4696
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:47,040
in concert with the higher high in Euro

4697
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:50,640
this is a USDX smt Divergence that means

4698
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:54,660
dollar which is USDX and

4699
03:08:54,660 --> 03:08:56,160
Euro

4700
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:57,899
are not in agreement with what they've

4701
03:08:57,899 --> 03:09:00,300
done at a time of day that is critical

4702
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,920
loving clothes

4703
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:04,859
so this would make me very very cautious

4704
03:09:04,859 --> 03:09:07,500
to expect higher prices and I'd be real

4705
03:09:07,500 --> 03:09:09,660
content with closing all of my position

4706
03:09:09,660 --> 03:09:12,359
in Longs on euro dollar and going into

4707
03:09:12,359 --> 03:09:15,359
the weekend happy that I destroyed it

4708
03:09:15,359 --> 03:09:17,340
so

4709
03:09:17,340 --> 03:09:20,220
anyway that's the business there

4710
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:23,160
um for your study you want to go into

4711
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:26,640
um the June 13th

4712
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:29,760
live stream on my YouTube Channel June

4713
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:31,740
13 2023 for the folks that watching this

4714
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:32,760
in the future

4715
03:09:32,760 --> 03:09:35,939
you can go to the 7 minute and 22nd

4716
03:09:35,939 --> 03:09:39,020
time on that video and you'll hear me

4717
03:09:39,020 --> 03:09:42,000
outlining these two levels here in this

4718
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:43,319
entire range here and that would be the

4719
03:09:43,319 --> 03:09:45,420
draw and liquidity that was mentioned on

4720
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:49,340
the 13th that means we were over here

4721
03:10:00,420 --> 03:10:03,000
we get here

4722
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,700
yeah we're um somewhere in here on the

4723
03:10:05,700 --> 03:10:08,520
time of day we were talking but

4724
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:11,399
we were using this um idea that we would

4725
03:10:11,399 --> 03:10:13,319
expand up into that

4726
03:10:13,319 --> 03:10:17,180
on the 13th and today

4727
03:10:17,819 --> 03:10:20,880
we're up here and through it okay

4728
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:23,220
so when I'm looking for smt diversions

4729
03:10:23,220 --> 03:10:25,140
smt diversions is I've never really

4730
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:27,600
settled on the real name for it it's a

4731
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:28,979
smart money technique or smart money

4732
03:10:28,979 --> 03:10:31,680
tool I use it interchangeably

4733
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:34,140
um it's just a matter of looking at the

4734
03:10:34,140 --> 03:10:36,359
relationship between closely

4735
03:10:36,359 --> 03:10:38,580
correlated assets or inversely

4736
03:10:38,580 --> 03:10:40,800
correlated assets meaning that euro

4737
03:10:40,800 --> 03:10:42,180
dollar usually goes higher when dollar

4738
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:44,640
goes lower but if you look at times when

4739
03:10:44,640 --> 03:10:47,340
they don't agree so if dollar makes a

4740
03:10:47,340 --> 03:10:48,540
lower low

4741
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:51,479
a symmetrical Market is a euro dollar

4742
03:10:51,479 --> 03:10:53,040
going higher high

4743
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:56,279
a euro dollar making a lower low and a

4744
03:10:56,279 --> 03:10:58,920
dollar Index making a lower high that is

4745
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:01,800
not symmetrical they have to agree so

4746
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:04,560
Euro higher high lower low in dollar

4747
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:06,960
euro lower low

4748
03:11:06,960 --> 03:11:10,439
higher high in dollar if ever at any

4749
03:11:10,439 --> 03:11:12,660
time that it's doing that during key

4750
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:14,939
times of the day which key times

4751
03:11:14,939 --> 03:11:17,760
which key Titans is the day for 4X and

4752
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:19,140
currency pairs

4753
03:11:19,140 --> 03:11:23,160
London open New York open one and close

4754
03:11:23,160 --> 03:11:25,560
yes you can trade Asia yes there's

4755
03:11:25,560 --> 03:11:27,660
opportunities in Asia but

4756
03:11:27,660 --> 03:11:29,340
the scope of this

4757
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:31,020
Workshop today

4758
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,180
I I don't want to focus on the lowest

4759
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:34,740
volatility I want to take you to where

4760
03:11:34,740 --> 03:11:37,620
the meat of these daily range moves and

4761
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:39,779
for the weekly opportunities that are

4762
03:11:39,779 --> 03:11:41,700
available I'm telling you how to go in

4763
03:11:41,700 --> 03:11:43,319
and see where these algorithmic price

4764
03:11:43,319 --> 03:11:45,660
swings are going to occur okay so every

4765
03:11:45,660 --> 03:11:47,220
institutional Priceline that forms in

4766
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:50,100
PA in 4X and dollar are going

4767
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:52,439
to be primarily inside the timeline as

4768
03:11:52,439 --> 03:11:55,020
I'm telling you Now by itself you know

4769
03:11:55,020 --> 03:11:56,760
when I first started teaching this you

4770
03:11:56,760 --> 03:12:00,840
know septics and Skeptics alike would

4771
03:12:00,840 --> 03:12:03,240
come out and say you know

4772
03:12:03,240 --> 03:12:05,819
this is nonsense or hindsight but it's

4773
03:12:05,819 --> 03:12:08,220
free it was for you to learn how to

4774
03:12:08,220 --> 03:12:11,580
trust where these things will occur and

4775
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:13,500
by pattern of recognition seeing it

4776
03:12:13,500 --> 03:12:15,540
repeat over and over again you learn to

4777
03:12:15,540 --> 03:12:17,460
trust that these are the times when

4778
03:12:17,460 --> 03:12:18,840
things really happen

4779
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:20,939
now the problem is

4780
03:12:20,939 --> 03:12:23,640
everything I've done so far in this live

4781
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:26,520
stream today that's all foundational for

4782
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:28,380
you to determine how price is going to

4783
03:12:28,380 --> 03:12:30,720
react and how it trades to where but you

4784
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:32,520
can quickly see how

4785
03:12:32,520 --> 03:12:35,040
many of the opportunities that you think

4786
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:37,319
are a surprise sometimes you know after

4787
03:12:37,319 --> 03:12:38,580
they happen because you're you're really

4788
03:12:38,580 --> 03:12:41,819
not that versed in trading the idea of

4789
03:12:41,819 --> 03:12:45,260
knowing how they form and why they form

4790
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:48,899
what they're reaching for helps you know

4791
03:12:48,899 --> 03:12:51,660
remove all that uncertainty now here's

4792
03:12:51,660 --> 03:12:53,399
another here's an interesting thing here

4793
03:12:53,399 --> 03:12:55,560
you can see how I told you that I would

4794
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:56,819
be done

4795
03:12:56,819 --> 03:12:59,040
I would be done I would hold on anything

4796
03:12:59,040 --> 03:13:02,700
longer for euro dollar it's 11 24 I

4797
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:04,439
would have already closed the trade on

4798
03:13:04,439 --> 03:13:05,819
this

4799
03:13:05,819 --> 03:13:07,920
if the euro dollar goes higher and the

4800
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:10,140
dollar makes a lower low

4801
03:13:10,140 --> 03:13:12,120
I would miss whatever that move is on

4802
03:13:12,120 --> 03:13:14,700
the upside on Euro

4803
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:16,859
I would admittedly

4804
03:13:16,859 --> 03:13:19,680
because I'm obsessively compulsive I

4805
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:21,420
would go back in there and try to

4806
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:23,460
justify I'm not suggesting that you do

4807
03:13:23,460 --> 03:13:25,620
this but I want you to know that as your

4808
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:28,319
Mentor this is a struggling point for me

4809
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:31,380
so I had to have rules that stated that

4810
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:33,720
once I come to the conclusion that time

4811
03:13:33,720 --> 03:13:36,540
is now at a period of time in a day

4812
03:13:36,540 --> 03:13:39,240
where the opposite end of the range is

4813
03:13:39,240 --> 03:13:40,859
formed where we've been seeing it Go

4814
03:13:40,859 --> 03:13:42,540
lower that means that the low is

4815
03:13:42,540 --> 03:13:43,979
probably forming sometime between 10

4816
03:13:43,979 --> 03:13:46,620
o'clock and noon New York local time for

4817
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:47,580
a dollar

4818
03:13:47,580 --> 03:13:49,439
that means that the high is forming

4819
03:13:49,439 --> 03:13:52,140
sometime between 10 o'clock and noon on

4820
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:54,479
euro dollar

4821
03:13:54,479 --> 03:13:57,180
there can be like I mentioned earlier in

4822
03:13:57,180 --> 03:13:59,100
Forex and in currency pairs there can be

4823
03:13:59,100 --> 03:14:01,740
a bleed over into the afternoon in New

4824
03:14:01,740 --> 03:14:05,040
York session I am not worrying about the

4825
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:07,080
dollar or

4826
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:09,600
Futures contracts or even the Forex

4827
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:11,399
currencies

4828
03:14:11,399 --> 03:14:14,040
during that time of day my focus would

4829
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:17,760
transition from Forex to stock index

4830
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:18,779
futures

4831
03:14:18,779 --> 03:14:21,479
so that would be my my trading day would

4832
03:14:21,479 --> 03:14:24,240
move from 4X overnight and then go into

4833
03:14:24,240 --> 03:14:26,160
bond trading in the morning the morning

4834
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:28,380
session and then I would either do an

4835
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:30,180
overlap with

4836
03:14:30,180 --> 03:14:33,300
you know index futures or finish my day

4837
03:14:33,300 --> 03:14:36,000
in Forex and then at London close all my

4838
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,580
focus goes to New York lunch hour

4839
03:14:38,580 --> 03:14:41,279
trading the run-on stops that was taking

4840
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:43,319
place on the holders of Longs or shorts

4841
03:14:43,319 --> 03:14:45,960
in stock index Futures and then I would

4842
03:14:45,960 --> 03:14:48,240
prepare for the afternoon session

4843
03:14:48,240 --> 03:14:49,800
and then I would do some kind of a bond

4844
03:14:49,800 --> 03:14:51,779
trade in the last you know 30 minutes or

4845
03:14:51,779 --> 03:14:53,399
whatever on Market on close and that

4846
03:14:53,399 --> 03:14:55,020
would be my trading day that's that was

4847
03:14:55,020 --> 03:14:58,140
how I did things and when I stopped

4848
03:14:58,140 --> 03:15:01,200
trading Forex and went back to my roots

4849
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:04,620
of which is index Futures Trading

4850
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:06,660
um because that's where my focus is I'm

4851
03:15:06,660 --> 03:15:09,300
teaching PA with that Medium

4852
03:15:09,300 --> 03:15:11,160
but you can clearly see all the things

4853
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:12,479
I'm teaching you here that are already

4854
03:15:12,479 --> 03:15:15,840
in my YouTube videos I'm taking my

4855
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:16,859
opinion

4856
03:15:16,859 --> 03:15:19,380
of how I would teach the folks

4857
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:21,359
one-on-one this is exactly what we'll be

4858
03:15:21,359 --> 03:15:23,700
doing every day all week long we'll be

4859
03:15:23,700 --> 03:15:25,439
going through every single thing that I

4860
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:27,000
told the person the previous week what

4861
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:28,680
would happen and it would give them a

4862
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:31,080
foundation and then come the middle of

4863
03:15:31,080 --> 03:15:32,640
the week I would say Okay based on what

4864
03:15:32,640 --> 03:15:35,520
we're showing you where would you focus

4865
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:36,720
on your trading where do you feel

4866
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:38,279
compelled to trade do you want to trade

4867
03:15:38,279 --> 03:15:40,260
on an hourly time frame and try to get

4868
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:43,560
like short-term intraday trades or do

4869
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:45,060
you want to scalp where you're using a

4870
03:15:45,060 --> 03:15:47,580
15 minute or less or do you want to be a

4871
03:15:47,580 --> 03:15:49,500
short-term Trader using primarily just

4872
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:51,479
the daily chart and using the Open high

4873
03:15:51,479 --> 03:15:53,939
low and close for power three to get

4874
03:15:53,939 --> 03:15:56,220
your setups to trade for you know one to

4875
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:58,260
three days of short-term Trading

4876
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:01,500
and depending upon what the student you

4877
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:03,540
know would tell me then I would spend

4878
03:16:03,540 --> 03:16:05,760
the latter portions of the week framing

4879
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:07,560
that out in a model for them so they can

4880
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:09,359
go home and start working with that

4881
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:13,140
that's what I did in the mid 90s so

4882
03:16:13,140 --> 03:16:16,080
I want to kind of get through the other

4883
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:19,340
markets and then

4884
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:24,240
teach you how to trade the FMC not from

4885
03:16:24,240 --> 03:16:27,180
payroll and CPI stuff

4886
03:16:27,180 --> 03:16:29,530
so let's go back up to it daily

4887
03:16:29,530 --> 03:16:31,859
[Music]

4888
03:16:31,859 --> 03:16:35,220
and go over to the pound and as soon as

4889
03:16:35,220 --> 03:16:36,359
I load the chart up and get it set up

4890
03:16:36,359 --> 03:16:39,380
we'll take a five minute break

4891
03:16:50,819 --> 03:16:54,200
so you want to be a Trader

4892
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:50,120

folks

4894
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:56,220
one more time if you could just give me

4900
03:24:26,279 --> 03:24:28,439
I'm not sure you can hear me now

4901
03:24:28,439 --> 03:24:31,939
I'm checking Twitter by the way

4902
03:24:38,520 --> 03:24:40,620
thank you Mo Professor Shelby thank you

4903
03:24:40,620 --> 03:24:42,060
appreciate it

4904
03:24:42,060 --> 03:24:44,220
all right so

4905
03:24:44,220 --> 03:24:47,580
we're looking at the cable market so on

4906
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:51,779
the 13th of June 2023 the live stream

4907
03:24:51,779 --> 03:24:54,660
for your notes if you go to the 14

4908
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:57,840
minute and 25 seconds through the 16

4909
03:24:57,840 --> 03:24:59,819
minute and 10 second

4910
03:24:59,819 --> 03:25:01,680
you'll hear me talk about what I'm going

4911
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:03,720
to refer to here so that's not J picked

4912
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:05,939
it's not hindsight it's foresight being

4913
03:25:05,939 --> 03:25:10,380
shown to you in your face okay so

4914
03:25:10,380 --> 03:25:12,600
I mentioned that

4915
03:25:12,600 --> 03:25:14,939
pound

4916
03:25:14,939 --> 03:25:16,979
would likely move higher now why would

4917
03:25:16,979 --> 03:25:19,560
pound move higher because we are

4918
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:22,020
expecting the dollar Index to go lower

4919
03:25:22,020 --> 03:25:23,700
so

4920
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:26,700
we measure

4921
03:25:26,700 --> 03:25:28,500
again the same way we were doing with

4922
03:25:28,500 --> 03:25:30,479
the euro dollar moments ago you're

4923
03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:31,920
constantly looking at the relationship

4924
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:33,840
between the dollar Index

4925
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:36,180
and the the market you're trading so if

4926
03:25:36,180 --> 03:25:38,760
it's in Forex if you're trading you're

4927
03:25:38,760 --> 03:25:40,439
constantly referring back you don't just

4928
03:25:40,439 --> 03:25:42,060
simply look at the the market you're

4929
03:25:42,060 --> 03:25:46,340
looking at as a trade and that's it

4930
03:25:46,439 --> 03:25:48,420
I don't know if

4931
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:49,859
this

4932
03:25:49,859 --> 03:25:51,300
splitting the screen and the two

4933
03:25:51,300 --> 03:25:53,279
requires

4934
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:55,680
a a specific membership or whatever God

4935
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:57,779
I don't know I can't recall I know I

4936
03:25:57,779 --> 03:25:59,460
have the highest one that is available

4937
03:25:59,460 --> 03:26:01,260
but

4938
03:26:01,260 --> 03:26:03,180
it is what it is I mean you're gonna

4939
03:26:03,180 --> 03:26:04,680
have to have some kind of way of having

4940
03:26:04,680 --> 03:26:06,359
two charts up

4941
03:26:06,359 --> 03:26:08,520
and while you don't need 12 monitors

4942
03:26:08,520 --> 03:26:10,920
like I do I don't need it I'm saying but

4943
03:26:10,920 --> 03:26:13,380
I have 12 minors available to me I'm

4944
03:26:13,380 --> 03:26:15,540
constantly referring to all the markets

4945
03:26:15,540 --> 03:26:18,479
I'm looking at to keep a good measure of

4946
03:26:18,479 --> 03:26:20,340
I don't have them open now I'm in my

4947
03:26:20,340 --> 03:26:22,620
trading office but I'm literally just

4948
03:26:22,620 --> 03:26:24,300
talking to you on a laptop the one I

4949
03:26:24,300 --> 03:26:26,160
used when I'm making my presentations

4950
03:26:26,160 --> 03:26:28,800
all the time so I'm only limited to see

4951
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:30,899
what I'm showing you here

4952
03:26:30,899 --> 03:26:35,460
but at a minimum you have to look at if

4953
03:26:35,460 --> 03:26:36,779
you're trading Forex you want to have

4954
03:26:36,779 --> 03:26:38,640
the dollar Index

4955
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:40,920
and whatever Market you're Trading

4956
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:43,080
and you you have to cycle through the

4957
03:26:43,080 --> 03:26:44,760
time frames okay

4958
03:26:44,760 --> 03:26:46,260
so on

4959
03:26:46,260 --> 03:26:49,500
the 13th of June 2023 I did a live

4960
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:52,620
stream and talked about how the British

4961
03:26:52,620 --> 03:26:53,760
pound

4962
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:56,399
would need to go into this

4963
03:26:56,399 --> 03:27:00,180
Fairway Gap go above it and treat it as

4964
03:27:00,180 --> 03:27:02,279
support before we would see a meaningful

4965
03:27:02,279 --> 03:27:04,140
move up and I said I wanted to see it

4966
03:27:04,140 --> 03:27:06,000
trade up into this

4967
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:07,979
shaded area here which

4968
03:27:07,979 --> 03:27:11,300
I'll take it over to

4969
03:27:15,540 --> 03:27:18,120
that's the weekly Gap okay it's a fair

4970
03:27:18,120 --> 03:27:19,620
value Gap right there

4971
03:27:19,620 --> 03:27:22,500
so this inefficiency

4972
03:27:22,500 --> 03:27:25,319
this inefficiency right here that has

4973
03:27:25,319 --> 03:27:28,319
that big down closed candle it's defined

4974
03:27:28,319 --> 03:27:30,779
by the candle to the right

4975
03:27:30,779 --> 03:27:33,800
that candle's High

4976
03:27:34,439 --> 03:27:35,640
and

4977
03:27:35,640 --> 03:27:39,120
this candle's low

4978
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:41,160
so the candlets right there that's what

4979
03:27:41,160 --> 03:27:43,260
I'm encapsulating in the analysis and

4980
03:27:43,260 --> 03:27:46,800
that was in the June 13th 2023

4981
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:48,660
live stream I said that we would

4982
03:27:48,660 --> 03:27:50,760
expected the trade up into that because

4983
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:52,800
it has unfinished business up here than

4984
03:27:52,800 --> 03:27:55,020
the terms I used

4985
03:27:55,020 --> 03:28:00,180
to drop into a 60 Minute chart

4986
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:03,060
okay you can see on the 13th is here we

4987
03:28:03,060 --> 03:28:05,279
were talking and doing our business on

4988
03:28:05,279 --> 03:28:07,859
the 13th all through here and I said I

4989
03:28:07,859 --> 03:28:09,359
want to see how

4990
03:28:09,359 --> 03:28:12,739
we try to trade up into

4991
03:28:13,140 --> 03:28:14,760
that Gap that doesn't appear on the

4992
03:28:14,760 --> 03:28:18,200
chart now let me go back into the weekly

4993
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:23,700
visibility of all intervals

4994
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:25,260
so now when I drop in the 60 Minute

4995
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:27,000
chart it should appear

4996
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:28,260
here we go

4997
03:28:28,260 --> 03:28:31,739
but this this Gap here is on the daily

4998
03:28:31,739 --> 03:28:33,479
chart as I mentioned I wanted to see it

4999
03:28:33,479 --> 03:28:35,520
act as support

5000
03:28:35,520 --> 03:28:37,080
we have a down close camera here which

5001
03:28:37,080 --> 03:28:38,939
is an order block which is at the near

5002
03:28:38,939 --> 03:28:42,779
top end of that range we expand outside

5003
03:28:42,779 --> 03:28:44,520
of it we come back down into the order

5004
03:28:44,520 --> 03:28:45,899
block which is a down closed candle

5005
03:28:45,899 --> 03:28:47,939
right there and then look what we're

5006
03:28:47,939 --> 03:28:50,580
doing we're working this level here

5007
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:53,340
here and then it

5008
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:55,200
that time right there on that candle

5009
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:57,660
what time is that

5010
03:28:57,660 --> 03:28:58,350
I mean

5011
03:28:58,350 --> 03:29:01,540
[Music]

5012
03:29:14,399 --> 03:29:16,620
that candle right there touching the top

5013
03:29:16,620 --> 03:29:17,640
end

5014
03:29:17,640 --> 03:29:19,859
of that daily favor I got that I told

5015
03:29:19,859 --> 03:29:23,720
you on the 13th between

5016
03:29:24,120 --> 03:29:26,819
14 minutes 25 seconds and the 16 minute

5017
03:29:26,819 --> 03:29:28,460
and 10 second

5018
03:29:28,460 --> 03:29:31,560
that minute marker

5019
03:29:31,560 --> 03:29:35,760
for the June 13 2023 live stream for

5020
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:37,560
pound dollar I stated that I want to see

5021
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:40,140
it trade using that

5022
03:29:40,140 --> 03:29:43,140
Fairway Gap as support permitting it to

5023
03:29:43,140 --> 03:29:46,979
trade as much as consequent encroachment

5024
03:29:46,979 --> 03:29:49,160
which is the midpoint okay

5025
03:29:49,160 --> 03:29:52,080
because we have this down closed candle

5026
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:56,899
and because we have the breaker

5027
03:29:58,140 --> 03:30:03,779
low high lower low extended in future or

5028
03:30:03,779 --> 03:30:04,520
um

5029
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:07,200
bullish breaker we have an order block

5030
03:30:07,200 --> 03:30:08,340
here

5031
03:30:08,340 --> 03:30:10,200
Trace down into it and it's also working

5032
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:12,720
and respecting that old daily

5033
03:30:12,720 --> 03:30:15,960
guy which we're treating as a inversion

5034
03:30:15,960 --> 03:30:17,580
pair of how you got

5035
03:30:17,580 --> 03:30:19,380
remember on a daily chart it looked like

5036
03:30:19,380 --> 03:30:21,560
this

5037
03:30:21,899 --> 03:30:23,700
it's this inefficiency on the downside

5038
03:30:23,700 --> 03:30:24,660
here

5039
03:30:24,660 --> 03:30:26,460
and if you think you understand what I'm

5040
03:30:26,460 --> 03:30:27,960
teaching because you watch one or two

5041
03:30:27,960 --> 03:30:30,420
videos and you think oh let's just this

5042
03:30:30,420 --> 03:30:32,279
is one of those optimal trade entries

5043
03:30:32,279 --> 03:30:33,840
it's got a FVG let's go short

5044
03:30:33,840 --> 03:30:35,399
there that that's not what you heard me

5045
03:30:35,399 --> 03:30:38,340
say on the 13th of June I said we want

5046
03:30:38,340 --> 03:30:40,800
to see a tree outside of it come back

5047
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:42,000
down and you can see it happening here

5048
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:43,979
on the daily Candlestick right there

5049
03:30:43,979 --> 03:30:47,040
so before I drop down again think about

5050
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:49,080
power three power three

5051
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:51,180
is my accumulation manipulation and

5052
03:30:51,180 --> 03:30:52,739
distribution Theory

5053
03:30:52,739 --> 03:30:55,380
and it was the

5054
03:30:55,380 --> 03:30:58,859
the major transition from relying on

5055
03:30:58,859 --> 03:31:00,779
everything that I had learned from Larry

5056
03:31:00,779 --> 03:31:02,760
Williams and capitalizing on something

5057
03:31:02,760 --> 03:31:04,739
that he admitted much like I admit my

5058
03:31:04,739 --> 03:31:07,260
weaknesses are my exits I'm never

5059
03:31:07,260 --> 03:31:09,600
satisfied no matter how good they are at

5060
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:12,120
the time you know afterwards I'm never

5061
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:15,479
satisfied with it so I'm highly critical

5062
03:31:15,479 --> 03:31:17,700
of myself in that regard when I

5063
03:31:17,700 --> 03:31:19,680
shouldn't be and that's why I try to

5064
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:21,660
teach you all try not to do those things

5065
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:23,399
because it's plagued me my entire career

5066
03:31:23,399 --> 03:31:26,100
I don't find any satisfaction in any of

5067
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:29,220
it but it's not about being perfect and

5068
03:31:29,220 --> 03:31:30,840
I'm pursuing Perfection and I already

5069
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:33,359
know I'm not going to obtain it but one

5070
03:31:33,359 --> 03:31:35,100
of the things I heard Larry talk about

5071
03:31:35,100 --> 03:31:38,160
in 1995

5072
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:40,380
he said that the

5073
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:43,620
his struggling point

5074
03:31:43,620 --> 03:31:46,560
was understanding how to be a buyer

5075
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:48,660
below the opening price because most of

5076
03:31:48,660 --> 03:31:49,979
what I was learning from him at the time

5077
03:31:49,979 --> 03:31:52,380
and what he was teaching that I don't I

5078
03:31:52,380 --> 03:31:54,000
haven't kept up with him I don't know

5079
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:55,260
what he's doing now and what he's done

5080
03:31:55,260 --> 03:31:57,120
and evolved from what it was I was

5081
03:31:57,120 --> 03:31:59,760
learning from in the 90s but at the time

5082
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:04,319
I bought everything he had everything so

5083
03:32:04,319 --> 03:32:06,000
either it was given to me by friends in

5084
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:07,200
the industry

5085
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:10,620
sorry Larry but

5086
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:13,920
or I paid for it outright and

5087
03:32:13,920 --> 03:32:15,960
at the time I loved everything and I

5088
03:32:15,960 --> 03:32:17,340
wanted to use everything that he was

5089
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:19,439
teaching and that was a problem and

5090
03:32:19,439 --> 03:32:20,939
that's what many of you do with my

5091
03:32:20,939 --> 03:32:23,640
Concepts don't do that

5092
03:32:23,640 --> 03:32:25,439
find your model look for what it is

5093
03:32:25,439 --> 03:32:26,939
you're trying to trade what type of

5094
03:32:26,939 --> 03:32:29,040
trade you're trying to be is it swing

5095
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:32,040
trading short-term trading day trading

5096
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:34,920
intraday scalping and then what asset

5097
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:37,200
are you going to focus on Futures index

5098
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:38,399
futures

5099
03:32:38,399 --> 03:32:41,880
current season 4X crypto I don't trade

5100
03:32:41,880 --> 03:32:44,460
crypto but I have students that have

5101
03:32:44,460 --> 03:32:47,399
made lots of money trading crypto and I

5102
03:32:47,399 --> 03:32:50,040
can't co-sign for it but they swear by

5103
03:32:50,040 --> 03:32:52,200
it working in there so I have to be very

5104
03:32:52,200 --> 03:32:54,060
careful because I do nothing with crypto

5105
03:32:54,060 --> 03:32:55,439
nothing

5106
03:32:55,439 --> 03:32:58,260
and I have no affinity for it so that's

5107
03:32:58,260 --> 03:32:59,700
why we won't talk about it we don't talk

5108
03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:01,260
about it I do think Bitcoin is going to

5109
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:04,680
zero anyway the low

5110
03:33:04,680 --> 03:33:08,720
of this candle right there

5111
03:33:09,720 --> 03:33:13,500
after the opening it trades down now I'm

5112
03:33:13,500 --> 03:33:16,380
not using this opening price

5113
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:19,399
I'm using

5114
03:33:21,720 --> 03:33:24,540
levels that I taught in the core content

5115
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:26,340
for the day trading I'll refer you back

5116
03:33:26,340 --> 03:33:28,680
to that for the life now I wanted to

5117
03:33:28,680 --> 03:33:30,060
make a note of this in my notes so I can

5118
03:33:30,060 --> 03:33:31,680
tell you what month it is

5119
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:33,660
but if you follow me on Twitter right

5120
03:33:33,660 --> 03:33:34,739
now

5121
03:33:34,739 --> 03:33:35,760
um if you

5122
03:33:35,760 --> 03:33:38,100
can recall what month it was that I did

5123
03:33:38,100 --> 03:33:40,620
all the day trading stuff

5124
03:33:40,620 --> 03:33:42,840
where I focused on day trading I taught

5125
03:33:42,840 --> 03:33:45,660
a lot about opening prices in there just

5126
03:33:45,660 --> 03:33:46,680
for the life of me I can't remember

5127
03:33:46,680 --> 03:33:49,020
which module month it was but it's

5128
03:33:49,020 --> 03:33:50,520
already on YouTube channel so I promise

5129
03:33:50,520 --> 03:33:52,739
you it's there it's free you can go look

5130
03:33:52,739 --> 03:33:55,500
at it but you can still use the trading

5131
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:58,080
view settings I don't trust them

5132
03:33:58,080 --> 03:34:01,200
entirely with this setting but the

5133
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:02,640
principle is this

5134
03:34:02,640 --> 03:34:05,460
if you're bullish if we are bullish if I

5135
03:34:05,460 --> 03:34:08,520
am bullish I'm looking for the market to

5136
03:34:08,520 --> 03:34:10,800
create these up close candles and draw

5137
03:34:10,800 --> 03:34:11,939
into

5138
03:34:11,939 --> 03:34:14,520
a level that I've already predetermined

5139
03:34:14,520 --> 03:34:16,200
so right away we had BS here

5140
03:34:16,200 --> 03:34:18,300
resting well here we want to see get up

5141
03:34:18,300 --> 03:34:19,859
into here because this is an unfinished

5142
03:34:19,859 --> 03:34:22,260
business this is all this range up here

5143
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:23,580
this is

5144
03:34:23,580 --> 03:34:26,880
the 14th so this was the actionable day

5145
03:34:26,880 --> 03:34:29,460
because we were talking about it live

5146
03:34:29,460 --> 03:34:31,500
on the 13th

5147
03:34:31,500 --> 03:34:33,479
but the day that you would be using the

5148
03:34:33,479 --> 03:34:35,220
information would be the very next day

5149
03:34:35,220 --> 03:34:38,580
on the 14th so we have the open it

5150
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:41,160
trades down from the opening into the

5151
03:34:41,160 --> 03:34:43,859
high of this Gap

5152
03:34:43,859 --> 03:34:45,660
that's not supplying demand

5153
03:34:45,660 --> 03:34:47,340
that's that's not it's not even trading

5154
03:34:47,340 --> 03:34:48,600
back to this down closed Scandal which

5155
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:52,160
you would see is an order block right

5156
03:34:52,859 --> 03:34:54,479
this was the level I told you to watch

5157
03:34:54,479 --> 03:34:57,000
but permissible

5158
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:58,800
to the extent that it could trade down

5159
03:34:58,800 --> 03:35:01,020
to half off which is essentially about

5160
03:35:01,020 --> 03:35:03,540
right there which would be mean what it

5161
03:35:03,540 --> 03:35:06,420
can trade to the opening price of that

5162
03:35:06,420 --> 03:35:07,920
down close candle which would be in what

5163
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:09,420
a bullish order block which is the

5164
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:12,319
reason why I said that

5165
03:35:12,540 --> 03:35:15,479
focusing primarily on using the February

5166
03:35:15,479 --> 03:35:18,060
Gap as a form of support before we would

5167
03:35:18,060 --> 03:35:20,580
see any meaningful run higher this

5168
03:35:20,580 --> 03:35:22,580
signature has to make its

5169
03:35:22,580 --> 03:35:26,040
self-present we happen to open here

5170
03:35:26,040 --> 03:35:28,979
and trade down that little movement down

5171
03:35:28,979 --> 03:35:31,859
is what I refer to as a Juda swing it's

5172
03:35:31,859 --> 03:35:35,100
a fake Moon and all that's occurring on

5173
03:35:35,100 --> 03:35:37,500
the 14th or Wednesday yesterday I know I

5174
03:35:37,500 --> 03:35:40,319
have the title of this live stream that

5175
03:35:40,319 --> 03:35:42,660
it is Friday the reason why I did that

5176
03:35:42,660 --> 03:35:44,880
is because my notes

5177
03:35:44,880 --> 03:35:46,979
right here I have the thought Friday

5178
03:35:46,979 --> 03:35:50,340
Workshop so that's why I keep saying

5179
03:35:50,340 --> 03:35:51,600
Friday when I every time I look at my

5180
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:54,660
notes to keep myself on track

5181
03:35:54,660 --> 03:35:56,880
my subconscious is saying it's Friday I

5182
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:59,580
know it's not Friday but because I wrote

5183
03:35:59,580 --> 03:36:01,080
it incorrectly this morning I keep

5184
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:03,960
running with that so the live streams

5185
03:36:03,960 --> 03:36:05,580
title will change to a Thursday

5186
03:36:05,580 --> 03:36:07,920
obviously but that's not me editing

5187
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:09,359
anything except for the title all the

5188
03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:10,500
content and everything's here live

5189
03:36:10,500 --> 03:36:11,700
you're all watching it I don't know how

5190
03:36:11,700 --> 03:36:13,560
many people are watching and if I looked

5191
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:14,819
I'd probably be nervous about how many

5192
03:36:14,819 --> 03:36:17,040
people are doing that but to say on

5193
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:19,560
track I just know that I mentioned that

5194
03:36:19,560 --> 03:36:22,500
this occurrence here will be what we

5195
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:24,120
would be favoring and then we would want

5196
03:36:24,120 --> 03:36:28,500
to trade up into this range now I taught

5197
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:31,680
recently and I don't recall what video

5198
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:33,720
it was and this is where I'm weak as a

5199
03:36:33,720 --> 03:36:34,920
mentor

5200
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:36,779
um

5201
03:36:36,779 --> 03:36:39,180
I don't do a lot of

5202
03:36:39,180 --> 03:36:42,420
indexing or table of content stuff

5203
03:36:42,420 --> 03:36:44,040
because

5204
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:46,800
if I start that I'll want to go nuts

5205
03:36:46,800 --> 03:36:48,060
with it and I just don't have the time

5206
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:50,880
to do it and this is more than enough

5207
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:52,979
you're doing you're getting this for

5208
03:36:52,979 --> 03:36:54,420
free

5209
03:36:54,420 --> 03:36:57,540
and it's it's worth more than any other

5210
03:36:57,540 --> 03:36:58,979
thing out there you would buy as a

5211
03:36:58,979 --> 03:37:00,960
course because it's been proven to you

5212
03:37:00,960 --> 03:37:02,640
before it happened I told you what to

5213
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:04,620
look for and I'm telling you now what I

5214
03:37:04,620 --> 03:37:06,120
used to get that

5215
03:37:06,120 --> 03:37:08,340
understanding and it will repeat it

5216
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:09,840
doesn't change it doesn't fall away

5217
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:11,399
these are the same things that I've been

5218
03:37:11,399 --> 03:37:13,739
using for 30 years that work

5219
03:37:13,739 --> 03:37:15,720
continuously over and over and over

5220
03:37:15,720 --> 03:37:17,220
again to be able to call these moves in

5221
03:37:17,220 --> 03:37:18,779
the marketplace which is the only thing

5222
03:37:18,779 --> 03:37:21,000
I promise I can promise you that you

5223
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:23,399
will read PA very very

5224
03:37:23,399 --> 03:37:25,859
precisely

5225
03:37:25,859 --> 03:37:27,720
whether you find profitability with it

5226
03:37:27,720 --> 03:37:30,180
or not that's the hard question because

5227
03:37:30,180 --> 03:37:31,920
you will bring in your own character

5228
03:37:31,920 --> 03:37:34,140
flaws just like I have a character flaw

5229
03:37:34,140 --> 03:37:36,840
with my acceptance of whatever I do as

5230
03:37:36,840 --> 03:37:39,300
an exit on my positions

5231
03:37:39,300 --> 03:37:41,100
whether they're profitable or not I'm

5232
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:43,020
not satisfied with that

5233
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:45,359
so I want you to understand that I'm not

5234
03:37:45,359 --> 03:37:47,220
AI I'm a human being that I that that

5235
03:37:47,220 --> 03:37:50,460
frustrates me and um it's plagued me for

5236
03:37:50,460 --> 03:37:53,279
30 years don't do those things with your

5237
03:37:53,279 --> 03:37:55,500
development or create those things where

5238
03:37:55,500 --> 03:37:57,060
you're trading because if you do that

5239
03:37:57,060 --> 03:37:58,260
early on

5240
03:37:58,260 --> 03:38:01,380
they will derail you and I I actually

5241
03:38:01,380 --> 03:38:04,620
learned majority of what I know in my

5242
03:38:04,620 --> 03:38:06,120
first three years

5243
03:38:06,120 --> 03:38:08,880
but I messed up by trying to change

5244
03:38:08,880 --> 03:38:10,680
things improve things that were already

5245
03:38:10,680 --> 03:38:11,819
perfect

5246
03:38:11,819 --> 03:38:14,220
and one of the things that I had said in

5247
03:38:14,220 --> 03:38:16,380
my mind that I would have a perfect exit

5248
03:38:16,380 --> 03:38:18,720
and I'm never gonna have that I'm

5249
03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:20,100
convinced I'm never gonna have it but

5250
03:38:20,100 --> 03:38:22,200
because I'm wired to be obsessively

5251
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:24,960
compulsive I wrestle with that so I

5252
03:38:24,960 --> 03:38:27,359
teach you how to overcome that by not

5253
03:38:27,359 --> 03:38:29,220
trying to go into it in the early stages

5254
03:38:29,220 --> 03:38:30,540
of your training

5255
03:38:30,540 --> 03:38:32,640
because if you create character flaws in

5256
03:38:32,640 --> 03:38:35,340
your trading early on you wrestle with

5257
03:38:35,340 --> 03:38:37,800
them for the rest of your life

5258
03:38:37,800 --> 03:38:40,560
and there is no Magic Eraser to get rid

5259
03:38:40,560 --> 03:38:42,479
of them you wrestle with them the rest

5260
03:38:42,479 --> 03:38:43,739
of your life

5261
03:38:43,739 --> 03:38:45,960
every time I look at a market move

5262
03:38:45,960 --> 03:38:48,060
if if it's something I wasn't watching

5263
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:49,739
and it happened

5264
03:38:49,739 --> 03:38:51,899
even though I know I didn't need that

5265
03:38:51,899 --> 03:38:53,160
move

5266
03:38:53,160 --> 03:38:55,560
it pisses me off that I didn't have it

5267
03:38:55,560 --> 03:38:57,120
recorded and executed so I can show it

5268
03:38:57,120 --> 03:38:59,100
to the community

5269
03:38:59,100 --> 03:39:01,800
because I know I would be in that trade

5270
03:39:01,800 --> 03:39:04,200
I'm sometimes thinking about a trade

5271
03:39:04,200 --> 03:39:06,000
that I got hurt in

5272
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:07,680
and because I see something that my

5273
03:39:07,680 --> 03:39:09,180
subconscious I've looked at things for

5274
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:11,939
30 years and if I see something

5275
03:39:11,939 --> 03:39:14,279
and I got hurt in it in the past

5276
03:39:14,279 --> 03:39:16,260
I remember that and it's a distraction

5277
03:39:16,260 --> 03:39:18,060
and I wrestle with that you don't have

5278
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:20,100
that yet you're brand new you don't have

5279
03:39:20,100 --> 03:39:21,960
those War Stories and scars that you

5280
03:39:21,960 --> 03:39:23,580
have to go yeah I remember that happened

5281
03:39:23,580 --> 03:39:26,340
but that's not this trade so

5282
03:39:26,340 --> 03:39:29,040
that's the reality of this you're going

5283
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:32,340
to pick up a lot of painful scars and

5284
03:39:32,340 --> 03:39:34,020
wrestle through that the rest of your

5285
03:39:34,020 --> 03:39:38,160
career nobody nobody ever gets to a

5286
03:39:38,160 --> 03:39:40,500
point of Mastery where they don't have

5287
03:39:40,500 --> 03:39:42,899
any kind of emotional tug of war that

5288
03:39:42,899 --> 03:39:44,460
takes place because if they have real

5289
03:39:44,460 --> 03:39:46,020
experience

5290
03:39:46,020 --> 03:39:47,880
invariably your mind's going to go back

5291
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:49,439
to a time when you run a trade that

5292
03:39:49,439 --> 03:39:51,120
looks similar to this one and then you

5293
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:53,220
gotta push through it and stick to the

5294
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:56,520
rules the rules say stay with the trade

5295
03:39:56,520 --> 03:39:58,439
I don't care if it hurt me this many

5296
03:39:58,439 --> 03:40:00,899
times years and years ago it looks like

5297
03:40:00,899 --> 03:40:02,279
the way it does you see all these guys

5298
03:40:02,279 --> 03:40:04,380
that make I'm getting somewhere by the

5299
03:40:04,380 --> 03:40:06,359
way with this the

5300
03:40:06,359 --> 03:40:08,100
the folks that draw out these charts and

5301
03:40:08,100 --> 03:40:10,680
says look at this the last time in 1929

5302
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:11,819
the chart looked like this and it's

5303
03:40:11,819 --> 03:40:13,739
gonna crash and everybody's been calling

5304
03:40:13,739 --> 03:40:15,899
for the crash you know through the

5305
03:40:15,899 --> 03:40:18,420
summer and I said I don't think we're

5306
03:40:18,420 --> 03:40:20,520
gonna crash I don't think we're going to

5307
03:40:20,520 --> 03:40:22,920
consolidate we could consolidate but I

5308
03:40:22,920 --> 03:40:24,600
think we're going to go up higher

5309
03:40:24,600 --> 03:40:28,819
and we've been going higher so

5310
03:40:28,819 --> 03:40:32,040
my rules stated that I should have

5311
03:40:32,040 --> 03:40:35,040
looked for and expected as you know I

5312
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:36,779
wanted to see the seasonal influence

5313
03:40:36,779 --> 03:40:38,460
that I'd like to see that takes us into

5314
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:41,399
a low on June and have that little bit

5315
03:40:41,399 --> 03:40:43,260
of a drop but that seasonal tendency

5316
03:40:43,260 --> 03:40:45,359
didn't didn't materialize and throughout

5317
03:40:45,359 --> 03:40:46,859
that seasonal tendency you heard me

5318
03:40:46,859 --> 03:40:50,520
calling it higher that was only learned

5319
03:40:50,520 --> 03:40:51,840
by experience

5320
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:54,060
but I also stated that when a seasonal

5321
03:40:54,060 --> 03:40:57,120
tendency is likely to occur

5322
03:40:57,120 --> 03:40:58,500
a seasonal tendency by the way if you're

5323
03:40:58,500 --> 03:41:01,620
new is simply a certain time of the year

5324
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:03,319
certain month of the year

5325
03:41:03,319 --> 03:41:06,540
a certain asset classes or a particular

5326
03:41:06,540 --> 03:41:09,720
Market performs a certain way more times

5327
03:41:09,720 --> 03:41:12,660
than not so it's like a

5328
03:41:12,660 --> 03:41:14,580
well it's like a season tendency for for

5329
03:41:14,580 --> 03:41:16,739
snow you know it's not likely to snow in

5330
03:41:16,739 --> 03:41:19,020
New York in July

5331
03:41:19,020 --> 03:41:21,300
and it's not likely to go to 90 degrees

5332
03:41:21,300 --> 03:41:25,160
in February in New York

5333
03:41:25,200 --> 03:41:27,239
when that stuff happens we probably need

5334
03:41:27,239 --> 03:41:28,859
to be paying attention but generally

5335
03:41:28,859 --> 03:41:30,960
seasonal Tendencies state that those are

5336
03:41:30,960 --> 03:41:33,479
the normalcy well there's there's a

5337
03:41:33,479 --> 03:41:35,160
factor in the marketplace that we refer

5338
03:41:35,160 --> 03:41:37,560
to as acetyl tendency that I was

5339
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:39,600
expecting not used many times over the

5340
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:43,739
years that the the low forms in June

5341
03:41:43,739 --> 03:41:46,200
and there's a decline the last week of

5342
03:41:46,200 --> 03:41:50,460
April going down into mid midweek of the

5343
03:41:50,460 --> 03:41:52,920
second week of June

5344
03:41:52,920 --> 03:41:56,399
now it doesn't form all the time but as

5345
03:41:56,399 --> 03:41:58,620
I indicated in my lessons about seasonal

5346
03:41:58,620 --> 03:42:00,359
tendency on my YouTube channel and also

5347
03:42:00,359 --> 03:42:02,220
as I mentioned recently in the last few

5348
03:42:02,220 --> 03:42:03,840
months

5349
03:42:03,840 --> 03:42:06,239
that if a seasonal tendency does not

5350
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:08,340
form or continue like it does in the

5351
03:42:08,340 --> 03:42:09,359
past

5352
03:42:09,359 --> 03:42:12,180
the fact that it's not there many times

5353
03:42:12,180 --> 03:42:14,160
is a

5354
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:16,140
very strong indication like for instance

5355
03:42:16,140 --> 03:42:18,660
I'll give you an example I would like I

5356
03:42:18,660 --> 03:42:21,060
would have liked rather to see the stock

5357
03:42:21,060 --> 03:42:23,819
index Futures the trade lower throughout

5358
03:42:23,819 --> 03:42:26,100
May into the first or second of June

5359
03:42:26,100 --> 03:42:28,500
that's what I wanted to see

5360
03:42:28,500 --> 03:42:30,720
now wanting to see something and then

5361
03:42:30,720 --> 03:42:32,580
taking that one and then trying to

5362
03:42:32,580 --> 03:42:34,380
impose your will in the marketplace and

5363
03:42:34,380 --> 03:42:36,779
try to force a trade into it that's what

5364
03:42:36,779 --> 03:42:38,279
I did when I was 20 years old and that's

5365
03:42:38,279 --> 03:42:40,439
how I blew my accounts when I did those

5366
03:42:40,439 --> 03:42:43,439
things I was forcing my will and what I

5367
03:42:43,439 --> 03:42:45,540
wanted to see happen versus sticking to

5368
03:42:45,540 --> 03:42:48,540
what the Market's telling me now as a

5369
03:42:48,540 --> 03:42:50,819
more refined analyst when I look at

5370
03:42:50,819 --> 03:42:52,739
PA now

5371
03:42:52,739 --> 03:42:55,859
I defer all the I want I want versus

5372
03:42:55,859 --> 03:42:58,500
what is this algorithm telling me what's

5373
03:42:58,500 --> 03:43:00,600
PA showing me in the chart

5374
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:02,700
and a lot of people were trying to you

5375
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:04,380
know look for shorts you know the older

5376
03:43:04,380 --> 03:43:05,939
timer guys were saying the Market's

5377
03:43:05,939 --> 03:43:07,439
going to consolidate and I said okay

5378
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:09,660
well if the older crowd saying we're

5379
03:43:09,660 --> 03:43:11,399
going to consolidate and the retail

5380
03:43:11,399 --> 03:43:12,899
saying we're going to crash

5381
03:43:12,899 --> 03:43:14,760
I'm going to trust everything that's

5382
03:43:14,760 --> 03:43:16,200
saying that's going to go higher so if

5383
03:43:16,200 --> 03:43:17,399
they're going to go higher what's it

5384
03:43:17,399 --> 03:43:19,260
going to reach for buy stops and

5385
03:43:19,260 --> 03:43:20,819
inefficiencies and that's why I took you

5386
03:43:20,819 --> 03:43:22,920
to the weekly chart in a daily chart to

5387
03:43:22,920 --> 03:43:24,720
also answer the folks that don't want to

5388
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:26,279
day trade they want to see longer higher

5389
03:43:26,279 --> 03:43:28,100
term frame entire time frame rather

5390
03:43:28,100 --> 03:43:30,540
perspective they don't like the one

5391
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:32,340
minute chart stuff okay because they

5392
03:43:32,340 --> 03:43:34,620
think that that's you know useless to

5393
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:36,420
them but that same thing that I'm using

5394
03:43:36,420 --> 03:43:38,399
in an hour I'm sorry a one minute chart

5395
03:43:38,399 --> 03:43:41,279
I'm using one a 15 an hourly four hour

5396
03:43:41,279 --> 03:43:44,340
daily weekly monthly it's the same thing

5397
03:43:44,340 --> 03:43:46,560
the same idea that I'm using

5398
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:49,200
inefficiencies in liquidity

5399
03:43:49,200 --> 03:43:52,260
in Market structure there's a there's a

5400
03:43:52,260 --> 03:43:54,000
plethora of setups that are happening

5401
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:55,080
all day long

5402
03:43:55,080 --> 03:43:56,399
all day long

5403
03:43:56,399 --> 03:43:57,720
and you're never going to run out of

5404
03:43:57,720 --> 03:44:00,180
setups but the problem is is you're not

5405
03:44:00,180 --> 03:44:02,100
giving yourself a chance to trust what

5406
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:03,300
you're learning is going to give you

5407
03:44:03,300 --> 03:44:05,700
more than you ever need

5408
03:44:05,700 --> 03:44:07,920
like I could be here all day long every

5409
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:10,500
single day all night long

5410
03:44:10,500 --> 03:44:12,300
finding setups here they're all over the

5411
03:44:12,300 --> 03:44:13,020
place

5412
03:44:13,020 --> 03:44:15,420
if I pushed like that I will take losing

5413
03:44:15,420 --> 03:44:17,880
trades more than you see me showing you

5414
03:44:17,880 --> 03:44:21,420
but I've learned where I want to take

5415
03:44:21,420 --> 03:44:23,760
initiative and say I want to only work

5416
03:44:23,760 --> 03:44:25,560
here

5417
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:28,380
I have Insight that you know allows me

5418
03:44:28,380 --> 03:44:30,060
to be more

5419
03:44:30,060 --> 03:44:32,520
accurate in that regard but I teach you

5420
03:44:32,520 --> 03:44:34,200
how to find that and I'm doing it today

5421
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:36,779
how to find the choices the cream of the

5422
03:44:36,779 --> 03:44:39,660
crop setups for the week and live there

5423
03:44:39,660 --> 03:44:43,260
once you nail down a win like that stop

5424
03:44:43,260 --> 03:44:45,479
don't don't trade again if you're a

5425
03:44:45,479 --> 03:44:48,420
YouTuber stop let your audience see that

5426
03:44:48,420 --> 03:44:49,859
you're controlling yourself and you have

5427
03:44:49,859 --> 03:44:51,479
discipline it doesn't matter that you

5428
03:44:51,479 --> 03:44:53,040
come back the next day and you trade and

5429
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:54,779
you're live and you say oh I think I

5430
03:44:54,779 --> 03:44:56,279
should be done if you're asking your

5431
03:44:56,279 --> 03:44:57,720
audience whether you should stop trading

5432
03:44:57,720 --> 03:44:59,700
or not you're not in control

5433
03:44:59,700 --> 03:45:02,220
you're being driven by your audience so

5434
03:45:02,220 --> 03:45:03,960
that's another thing that you have to

5435
03:45:03,960 --> 03:45:05,760
ask yourself why are you learning how to

5436
03:45:05,760 --> 03:45:07,319
trade are you wanting to be a YouTuber

5437
03:45:07,319 --> 03:45:09,720
where you're allowing the in the

5438
03:45:09,720 --> 03:45:11,580
influence of your viewers

5439
03:45:11,580 --> 03:45:13,200
while you're trying to act like the

5440
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:15,420
influencer if you act

5441
03:45:15,420 --> 03:45:17,520
in a manner that you're trying to teach

5442
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:19,439
or showcase what you're doing and you're

5443
03:45:19,439 --> 03:45:21,420
allowing this audience to influence

5444
03:45:21,420 --> 03:45:23,580
whether you take a trade or not

5445
03:45:23,580 --> 03:45:25,319
you're not in control

5446
03:45:25,319 --> 03:45:28,020
you're letting outward things create

5447
03:45:28,020 --> 03:45:30,540
impulsive decisions about you taking on

5448
03:45:30,540 --> 03:45:32,100
risk

5449
03:45:32,100 --> 03:45:34,200
so it's important not to get wrapped up

5450
03:45:34,200 --> 03:45:35,760
in it I don't listen to people that say

5451
03:45:35,760 --> 03:45:38,040
dance for me monkey out I'm not doing it

5452
03:45:38,040 --> 03:45:41,399
I know what I make mistakes in and when

5453
03:45:41,399 --> 03:45:43,979
I get impulsive my emotions and I'm

5454
03:45:43,979 --> 03:45:46,979
bipolar I can't trade

5455
03:45:46,979 --> 03:45:49,680
when I'm in a manic episode I can't

5456
03:45:49,680 --> 03:45:52,439
trade when I'm in a euphoric episode so

5457
03:45:52,439 --> 03:45:55,020
it takes a great deal of focus for me to

5458
03:45:55,020 --> 03:45:56,760
even have these kinds of discussions

5459
03:45:56,760 --> 03:45:58,500
with you

5460
03:45:58,500 --> 03:46:02,040
sometimes it's next to Impossible and if

5461
03:46:02,040 --> 03:46:03,239
you listen to

5462
03:46:03,239 --> 03:46:05,100
you know

5463
03:46:05,100 --> 03:46:07,260
episodes in the past where you know I

5464
03:46:07,260 --> 03:46:08,880
get either emotional

5465
03:46:08,880 --> 03:46:11,399
or I go off the rails and get a little

5466
03:46:11,399 --> 03:46:13,439
bit more belligerent than I should it's

5467
03:46:13,439 --> 03:46:15,060
not because I plan to do it it's because

5468
03:46:15,060 --> 03:46:17,700
I have a chemical imbalance so I have

5469
03:46:17,700 --> 03:46:19,859
very rigid rules that I've had to place

5470
03:46:19,859 --> 03:46:22,080
on myself much more rigid than the

5471
03:46:22,080 --> 03:46:24,660
average person because I battle a mental

5472
03:46:24,660 --> 03:46:26,220
illness that is very hard for me to

5473
03:46:26,220 --> 03:46:27,779
wrestle sometimes

5474
03:46:27,779 --> 03:46:29,700
and trying to trade and be in the

5475
03:46:29,700 --> 03:46:31,200
industry it's highly technical like this

5476
03:46:31,200 --> 03:46:34,739
it's it's not easy it's really not easy

5477
03:46:34,739 --> 03:46:37,260
so anyway talking about the power 3

5478
03:46:37,260 --> 03:46:40,040
concept is the accumulation

5479
03:46:40,040 --> 03:46:42,180
accumulation manipulation and

5480
03:46:42,180 --> 03:46:44,100
distribution

5481
03:46:44,100 --> 03:46:46,859
concept of using it on a interval any

5482
03:46:46,859 --> 03:46:49,140
time frame but I introduced it with the

5483
03:46:49,140 --> 03:46:50,880
daily chart because like I mentioned in

5484
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:53,460
the beginning of all that rant I've

5485
03:46:53,460 --> 03:46:55,439
warned you they could probably come up

5486
03:46:55,439 --> 03:46:58,500
I learned that Larry Williams died I

5487
03:46:58,500 --> 03:46:59,880
never found out if he ever figured it

5488
03:46:59,880 --> 03:47:01,439
out because he mentioned at the time in

5489
03:47:01,439 --> 03:47:03,359
1995 that he had a

5490
03:47:03,359 --> 03:47:06,420
a weakness or an uncertainty as to how

5491
03:47:06,420 --> 03:47:08,819
to determine when to be a buyer below

5492
03:47:08,819 --> 03:47:10,260
the opening price before you see these

5493
03:47:10,260 --> 03:47:13,319
big ranges and at the time I was

5494
03:47:13,319 --> 03:47:15,720
learning under his tutelage of his books

5495
03:47:15,720 --> 03:47:19,800
and his VHS tapes and courses that's how

5496
03:47:19,800 --> 03:47:22,200
I was learning he was my first real

5497
03:47:22,200 --> 03:47:24,540
mentor and I still have a great deal of

5498
03:47:24,540 --> 03:47:27,239
respect for him but I did move away from

5499
03:47:27,239 --> 03:47:29,640
most of what he taught and what I

5500
03:47:29,640 --> 03:47:31,859
learned from him but there is a Hallmark

5501
03:47:31,859 --> 03:47:33,779
to a lot of the things

5502
03:47:33,779 --> 03:47:36,479
that stayed with me because they're just

5503
03:47:36,479 --> 03:47:40,920
Market tourisms a market day that has a

5504
03:47:40,920 --> 03:47:42,540
big range

5505
03:47:42,540 --> 03:47:45,840
he taught that usually the open is near

5506
03:47:45,840 --> 03:47:48,120
the low or the high of the day so how do

5507
03:47:48,120 --> 03:47:50,279
you use that information if it's

5508
03:47:50,279 --> 03:47:52,560
expected to be a bullish day

5509
03:47:52,560 --> 03:47:54,420
and remember go back into the 13th of

5510
03:47:54,420 --> 03:47:55,560
live stream if you haven't watched that

5511
03:47:55,560 --> 03:47:57,060
live stream I promise you

5512
03:47:57,060 --> 03:47:58,979
don't watch it after this one because

5513
03:47:58,979 --> 03:48:01,260
we're going a long time today tomorrow

5514
03:48:01,260 --> 03:48:03,479
or over the weekend sometime watch the

5515
03:48:03,479 --> 03:48:06,720
13th of June 2023's live stream

5516
03:48:06,720 --> 03:48:10,739
and all these things I'm talking about

5517
03:48:10,739 --> 03:48:12,420
you'll be able to see this forming here

5518
03:48:12,420 --> 03:48:15,479
but when you're looking at a day when

5519
03:48:15,479 --> 03:48:18,840
you're anticipating bullishness

5520
03:48:18,840 --> 03:48:22,200
You're Expecting not just one day of

5521
03:48:22,200 --> 03:48:25,020
movement up which is why I take you

5522
03:48:25,020 --> 03:48:27,000
into the weekly chart

5523
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:29,819
that Weekly chart might have only a one

5524
03:48:29,819 --> 03:48:32,819
day event that creates the run to what

5525
03:48:32,819 --> 03:48:34,979
we would expect as a draw on liquidity a

5526
03:48:34,979 --> 03:48:36,840
draw on liquidity is where price is

5527
03:48:36,840 --> 03:48:39,660
likely to reach to whether it's reaching

5528
03:48:39,660 --> 03:48:41,520
down for sales thoughts below an old low

5529
03:48:41,520 --> 03:48:44,880
or to reaching down to a FVG

5530
03:48:44,880 --> 03:48:46,560
that's the only reason my price goes

5531
03:48:46,560 --> 03:48:49,200
down that's that's it in reverse when

5532
03:48:49,200 --> 03:48:52,380
it's likely to go higher but we look at

5533
03:48:52,380 --> 03:48:53,939
the weekly chart

5534
03:48:53,939 --> 03:48:55,979
with the expectation that there's an

5535
03:48:55,979 --> 03:48:57,479
expansion move

5536
03:48:57,479 --> 03:48:59,640
we don't need to predict the close of

5537
03:48:59,640 --> 03:49:01,680
the weekly candle we're just looking for

5538
03:49:01,680 --> 03:49:03,420
this

5539
03:49:03,420 --> 03:49:06,300
price movement with magnitude reaching

5540
03:49:06,300 --> 03:49:08,220
into an objective that we've identified

5541
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:09,779
on a weekly chart

5542
03:49:09,779 --> 03:49:11,760
so because of that we're taking that

5543
03:49:11,760 --> 03:49:13,739
insight and we're transposing it to our

5544
03:49:13,739 --> 03:49:16,080
LTF charts daily four hour

5545
03:49:16,080 --> 03:49:18,000
one hour and anything less all the way

5546
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:21,060
down to five second charts

5547
03:49:21,060 --> 03:49:23,340
I said that correctly five second charts

5548
03:49:23,340 --> 03:49:24,840
so

5549
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:26,880
if we're bullish and we've arrived at

5550
03:49:26,880 --> 03:49:29,340
the dollar going lower

5551
03:49:29,340 --> 03:49:31,560
cable or pound dollar as we see here is

5552
03:49:31,560 --> 03:49:33,300
likely to go higher and move up into

5553
03:49:33,300 --> 03:49:35,040
this shaded area which is what I refer

5554
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:37,800
to as the unfinished business if it's

5555
03:49:37,800 --> 03:49:39,120
going to go higher where is it going to

5556
03:49:39,120 --> 03:49:41,460
go well you have this high

5557
03:49:41,460 --> 03:49:43,859
to this low and what has already

5558
03:49:43,859 --> 03:49:46,319
happened we went to this High here so

5559
03:49:46,319 --> 03:49:48,779
what's resting above that High by side

5560
03:49:48,779 --> 03:49:52,080
so the minimum threshold would be to

5561
03:49:52,080 --> 03:49:55,500
what reach up to

5562
03:49:55,500 --> 03:49:56,520
where

5563
03:49:56,520 --> 03:49:59,960
this is a trick question by the way

5564
03:50:01,140 --> 03:50:03,600
if you're buying here

5565
03:50:03,600 --> 03:50:06,060
at the top of this fairbankment outline

5566
03:50:06,060 --> 03:50:07,500
then we would be expecting something at

5567
03:50:07,500 --> 03:50:09,479
the form when we did our livestream on

5568
03:50:09,479 --> 03:50:11,100
the third 13th

5569
03:50:11,100 --> 03:50:12,600
of June

5570
03:50:12,600 --> 03:50:15,420
we would expect the market to open trade

5571
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:18,120
down any down movement into this Gap

5572
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:21,120
will be treated as a Juda swing or a

5573
03:50:21,120 --> 03:50:24,420
fake decline retail will chase this

5574
03:50:24,420 --> 03:50:25,859
every day

5575
03:50:25,859 --> 03:50:27,479
they get caught up in it they want to

5576
03:50:27,479 --> 03:50:29,399
get short on a breakout they're using

5577
03:50:29,399 --> 03:50:31,500
some five minute 15 minute breakout rule

5578
03:50:31,500 --> 03:50:33,960
in London or New York or whatever you

5579
03:50:33,960 --> 03:50:37,319
know and that is a fake move it's

5580
03:50:37,319 --> 03:50:39,600
designed to do that very thing why would

5581
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:41,279
it be interesting to do that because

5582
03:50:41,279 --> 03:50:43,620
those cell stops being triggered to get

5583
03:50:43,620 --> 03:50:45,660
Traders short chasing it they think it's

5584
03:50:45,660 --> 03:50:47,160
going lower

5585
03:50:47,160 --> 03:50:49,140
is the perfect counterparty the smart

5586
03:50:49,140 --> 03:50:50,700
money going in and buying it because

5587
03:50:50,700 --> 03:50:53,160
they're the SS to their Buy

5588
03:50:53,160 --> 03:50:55,800
every long has that a sell site

5589
03:50:55,800 --> 03:50:58,140
every short has to have a long side

5590
03:50:58,140 --> 03:50:59,340
so

5591
03:50:59,340 --> 03:51:01,260
the

5592
03:51:01,260 --> 03:51:04,080
the dance between liquidity and how it's

5593
03:51:04,080 --> 03:51:07,020
utilized in PD

5594
03:51:07,020 --> 03:51:09,239
you have to take a step back away from

5595
03:51:09,239 --> 03:51:10,560
thinking about things in terms of

5596
03:51:10,560 --> 03:51:12,000
overbought oversold and indicator

5597
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:14,279
settings and things like that

5598
03:51:14,279 --> 03:51:18,060
and look at who's available right now

5599
03:51:18,060 --> 03:51:21,120
to take the other side of my trade

5600
03:51:21,120 --> 03:51:24,120
and utilize that as like a bus stop okay

5601
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:27,420
or a mile marker between Where You Are

5602
03:51:27,420 --> 03:51:29,580
and where it's ultimately going

5603
03:51:29,580 --> 03:51:31,739
Terminus is your low hanging fruit

5604
03:51:31,739 --> 03:51:34,859
objective that is not the end of the

5605
03:51:34,859 --> 03:51:35,700
move

5606
03:51:35,700 --> 03:51:38,939
Terminus is just where you define

5607
03:51:38,939 --> 03:51:40,920
where the low hanging fruit objective is

5608
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:43,020
if it just gets that far you've made

5609
03:51:43,020 --> 03:51:46,260
money if it reverses there great you've

5610
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:47,340
already made honey

5611
03:51:47,340 --> 03:51:49,739
if it continues you have something there

5612
03:51:49,739 --> 03:51:51,120
that could potentially

5613
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:53,220
pay more

5614
03:51:53,220 --> 03:51:55,680
but you don't need it to notice what

5615
03:51:55,680 --> 03:51:56,700
that would do for you if you haven't

5616
03:51:56,700 --> 03:51:58,620
considered what that would impact you in

5617
03:51:58,620 --> 03:52:01,319
terms of your psychology of the trader

5618
03:52:01,319 --> 03:52:03,540
you're not putting so much unrealistic

5619
03:52:03,540 --> 03:52:05,160
expectation on yourself

5620
03:52:05,160 --> 03:52:07,200
you're literally just placing a

5621
03:52:07,200 --> 03:52:08,640
realistic objective and what would that

5622
03:52:08,640 --> 03:52:10,819
be

5623
03:52:11,160 --> 03:52:13,680
if you're going long here

5624
03:52:13,680 --> 03:52:16,140
and it runs up and hits the low end of

5625
03:52:16,140 --> 03:52:18,600
that imbalance

5626
03:52:18,600 --> 03:52:20,040
that's profit

5627
03:52:20,040 --> 03:52:22,500
partial one

5628
03:52:22,500 --> 03:52:26,279
now if it doesn't go to

5629
03:52:26,279 --> 03:52:28,620
consequent quotient of that Wick what do

5630
03:52:28,620 --> 03:52:29,640
you think of that

5631
03:52:29,640 --> 03:52:32,100
that's a partial why

5632
03:52:32,100 --> 03:52:34,979
what I said earlier whenever there's a

5633
03:52:34,979 --> 03:52:37,080
high or a low that you're expecting to

5634
03:52:37,080 --> 03:52:38,220
be breached

5635
03:52:38,220 --> 03:52:40,380
traded to and through

5636
03:52:40,380 --> 03:52:43,620
if there is a wick or a tail consequent

5637
03:52:43,620 --> 03:52:46,200
encroachment that midpoint you must

5638
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:48,300
always every single time without

5639
03:52:48,300 --> 03:52:50,640
deviation must take a partial always

5640
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:53,040
it's in stone have it in your Journal

5641
03:52:53,040 --> 03:52:55,620
have it in your psyche expect it do it

5642
03:52:55,620 --> 03:52:57,979
always

5643
03:52:58,739 --> 03:53:00,600
then you have the BS

5644
03:53:00,600 --> 03:53:03,540
now we're expanding and I mentioned the

5645
03:53:03,540 --> 03:53:05,100
cable could trade up into this area here

5646
03:53:05,100 --> 03:53:08,060
because it's unfinished business

5647
03:53:09,359 --> 03:53:13,439
what levels above this BS can we

5648
03:53:13,439 --> 03:53:15,060
utilize

5649
03:53:15,060 --> 03:53:18,060
well I taught this and I think I don't

5650
03:53:18,060 --> 03:53:22,260
remember if it was in Twitter spaces

5651
03:53:22,260 --> 03:53:24,060
or if I

5652
03:53:24,060 --> 03:53:25,800
I think I did a live stream

5653
03:53:25,800 --> 03:53:27,239
I'm almost certain I did a live stream

5654
03:53:27,239 --> 03:53:28,500
at least

5655
03:53:28,500 --> 03:53:31,319
I might be having a senior moment here

5656
03:53:31,319 --> 03:53:33,720
I believe I did it I don't know I gotta

5657
03:53:33,720 --> 03:53:36,300
I'm second guessing myself now

5658
03:53:36,300 --> 03:53:39,180
but here is the gradient levels I'm

5659
03:53:39,180 --> 03:53:40,620
almost certain I did a live stream and

5660
03:53:40,620 --> 03:53:43,200
mentioned this but the

5661
03:53:43,200 --> 03:53:46,200
the low end of the gap which is all the

5662
03:53:46,200 --> 03:53:48,960
Shaded area here okay

5663
03:53:48,960 --> 03:53:52,319
Above This High we have the low quarter

5664
03:53:52,319 --> 03:53:54,779
percent the lower quarter

5665
03:53:54,779 --> 03:53:57,779
gradient level of this entire range then

5666
03:53:57,779 --> 03:54:00,000
we have consequential which is midpoint

5667
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:02,340
we steam through that so the next

5668
03:54:02,340 --> 03:54:04,439
objective would be

5669
03:54:04,439 --> 03:54:07,020
127 754.

5670
03:54:07,020 --> 03:54:09,899
that's a finite number it's it's it's a

5671
03:54:09,899 --> 03:54:12,060
static number so if you were targeting

5672
03:54:12,060 --> 03:54:13,680
that for another partial you would

5673
03:54:13,680 --> 03:54:16,319
factor in spread so you would deduct

5674
03:54:16,319 --> 03:54:19,380
whatever your typical spread is for your

5675
03:54:19,380 --> 03:54:20,580
pound dollar

5676
03:54:20,580 --> 03:54:22,560
Forex pair and then you would have a

5677
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:24,180
limit order sitting there and if it were

5678
03:54:24,180 --> 03:54:25,979
to expand up into that

5679
03:54:25,979 --> 03:54:28,979
you'd have a partial and there it is if

5680
03:54:28,979 --> 03:54:30,479
you're inclined to hold over the weekend

5681
03:54:30,479 --> 03:54:32,699
and you feel like this is going to open

5682
03:54:32,699 --> 03:54:35,279
up higher which it could do open up

5683
03:54:35,279 --> 03:54:37,140
above it and trade down and fill in the

5684
03:54:37,140 --> 03:54:38,520
gutless I'm playing devil's advocate for

5685
03:54:38,520 --> 03:54:40,199
a moment saying and I don't know this

5686
03:54:40,199 --> 03:54:41,160
because I'm

5687
03:54:41,160 --> 03:54:43,199
talking to you guys I'm watching it but

5688
03:54:43,199 --> 03:54:44,520
let's just say it makes the high today

5689
03:54:44,520 --> 03:54:47,040
already here and it's done we could Gap

5690
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:49,080
open and higher on Sunday

5691
03:54:49,080 --> 03:54:51,420
and then trade down to this and fill the

5692
03:54:51,420 --> 03:54:54,660
Gap and that would be a scenario if

5693
03:54:54,660 --> 03:54:56,100
you're willing to hold over the weekend

5694
03:54:56,100 --> 03:54:58,140
I'm not trying to entice you if you're

5695
03:54:58,140 --> 03:55:01,080
in it to do that of this giving you

5696
03:55:01,080 --> 03:55:03,120
scenarios how I would think about it and

5697
03:55:03,120 --> 03:55:05,520
when I was using over the weekend holds

5698
03:55:05,520 --> 03:55:07,380
when I would trade that whole positions

5699
03:55:07,380 --> 03:55:09,359
from Friday's close into Sunday's

5700
03:55:09,359 --> 03:55:11,760
opening that this idea I would use in

5701
03:55:11,760 --> 03:55:13,620
this context here because this is still

5702
03:55:13,620 --> 03:55:16,199
exposed this is the other portion of

5703
03:55:16,199 --> 03:55:18,239
that inefficiency on the weekly chart

5704
03:55:18,239 --> 03:55:20,760
remember all this movement from high to

5705
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:23,399
low that shaded area was one weekly

5706
03:55:23,399 --> 03:55:24,479
candle

5707
03:55:24,479 --> 03:55:27,600
where it only was going down so to

5708
03:55:27,600 --> 03:55:30,899
reprice efficiently we're seeing price

5709
03:55:30,899 --> 03:55:34,260
deliver on the upside so until it gets

5710
03:55:34,260 --> 03:55:36,060
up to this point here there's an

5711
03:55:36,060 --> 03:55:37,739
inefficiency in the form of a SS

5712
03:55:37,739 --> 03:55:40,080
and balance bias efficiency on that

5713
03:55:40,080 --> 03:55:42,000
Weekly chart

5714
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:43,739
these are the parts where you get lost

5715
03:55:43,739 --> 03:55:45,720
and this advice important that you make

5716
03:55:45,720 --> 03:55:48,660
sure that you rewind the video and scrub

5717
03:55:48,660 --> 03:55:49,859
back to the parts where I actually show

5718
03:55:49,859 --> 03:55:51,359
the weekly charts you can remember what

5719
03:55:51,359 --> 03:55:53,460
I'm showing you here but it's important

5720
03:55:53,460 --> 03:55:54,960
by having these HTF

5721
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:56,760
annotations on your weekly chart and

5722
03:55:56,760 --> 03:55:59,699
then showing them on every time frame

5723
03:55:59,699 --> 03:56:01,500
you won't be

5724
03:56:01,500 --> 03:56:04,020
you won't be surprised I mean the things

5725
03:56:04,020 --> 03:56:05,520
that

5726
03:56:05,520 --> 03:56:07,680
generally have happened to you in the

5727
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:11,760
past probably won't be a issue for you

5728
03:56:11,760 --> 03:56:13,920
when you start doing this

5729
03:56:13,920 --> 03:56:16,020
trying to hit the delete button and I'll

5730
03:56:16,020 --> 03:56:18,479
set some page down

5731
03:56:18,479 --> 03:56:21,359
50 year old eyes all right so anyway

5732
03:56:21,359 --> 03:56:23,640
we're going to take a look at the 14th

5733
03:56:23,640 --> 03:56:26,580
how we traded in here

5734
03:56:26,580 --> 03:56:28,260
and then we'll drop into a 16 minute

5735
03:56:28,260 --> 03:56:30,500
chart

5736
03:56:35,699 --> 03:56:38,160
all right so here is

5737
03:56:38,160 --> 03:56:40,620
the 14th at two o'clock

5738
03:56:40,620 --> 03:56:42,420
that's the beginning of what

5739
03:56:42,420 --> 03:56:45,359
London open Killzone

5740
03:56:45,359 --> 03:56:49,319
So Below actually prior to that at one

5741
03:56:49,319 --> 03:56:51,420
o'clock that's a European open

5742
03:56:51,420 --> 03:56:53,939
running open Killzone two o'clock to

5743
03:56:53,939 --> 03:56:55,260
five o'clock in the morning in your

5744
03:56:55,260 --> 03:56:58,880
local time then

5745
03:56:59,580 --> 03:57:01,920
we Gap up in here

5746
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:04,140
rip off into and then look at the bodies

5747
03:57:04,140 --> 03:57:06,739
here

5748
03:57:06,960 --> 03:57:09,180
that's the low of that Weekly imbalance

5749
03:57:09,180 --> 03:57:11,399
that fair value got

5750
03:57:11,399 --> 03:57:13,979
that's the signature I like to see when

5751
03:57:13,979 --> 03:57:16,859
you start seeing moves form and they

5752
03:57:16,859 --> 03:57:18,739
respect these HTF

5753
03:57:18,739 --> 03:57:22,020
inefficiencies or

5754
03:57:22,020 --> 03:57:24,800
areas where

5755
03:57:25,319 --> 03:57:27,840
a real Gap would be or we're not talking

5756
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:29,340
about new week opening gaps today we're

5757
03:57:29,340 --> 03:57:30,960
not talking about New Day opening gas by

5758
03:57:30,960 --> 03:57:32,760
the way in case you're wondering

5759
03:57:32,760 --> 03:57:33,479
um

5760
03:57:33,479 --> 03:57:35,399
but we're working with HTF

5761
03:57:35,399 --> 03:57:39,060
weekly and daily inefficiencies and this

5762
03:57:39,060 --> 03:57:40,380
is the real support and resistance

5763
03:57:40,380 --> 03:57:41,520
you're looking for like one of the

5764
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:43,439
things that I try to do

5765
03:57:43,439 --> 03:57:46,800
was determine a way of picking

5766
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:49,020
what retail support resistance should be

5767
03:57:49,020 --> 03:57:51,660
and that always this is the one you use

5768
03:57:51,660 --> 03:57:53,819
I would always get them wrong sometimes

5769
03:57:53,819 --> 03:57:55,380
I'd be right but most of the time I'd

5770
03:57:55,380 --> 03:57:57,779
get them wrong so what I wanted to do

5771
03:57:57,779 --> 03:58:00,960
was determine how I could bridge the gap

5772
03:58:00,960 --> 03:58:04,560
between the expectancy of traders to see

5773
03:58:04,560 --> 03:58:06,479
what is a support what is a real system

5774
03:58:06,479 --> 03:58:08,760
what qualifies and quantifies a support

5775
03:58:08,760 --> 03:58:11,640
or resistance and I found out that the

5776
03:58:11,640 --> 03:58:13,859
largest degree of precision is around

5777
03:58:13,859 --> 03:58:15,479
these inefficiencies

5778
03:58:15,479 --> 03:58:18,300
and anybody can say oh everybody's known

5779
03:58:18,300 --> 03:58:20,939
about gaps everyone's known about you

5780
03:58:20,939 --> 03:58:23,160
know inefficiencies but once they close

5781
03:58:23,160 --> 03:58:25,680
in they're done with them I'm not

5782
03:58:25,680 --> 03:58:27,899
they're Treasures to me I'm holding on

5783
03:58:27,899 --> 03:58:30,060
to them for months

5784
03:58:30,060 --> 03:58:31,920
and the algorithm will refer back to it

5785
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:34,500
which is why I keep a 60-day look back

5786
03:58:34,500 --> 03:58:37,560
on my charts I'll go back 60 days

5787
03:58:37,560 --> 03:58:40,080
in any old PD array whether it be a Fair

5788
03:58:40,080 --> 03:58:42,960
makeup a breaker anything like that I

5789
03:58:42,960 --> 03:58:44,939
will refer to it if it's in the proper

5790
03:58:44,939 --> 03:58:46,199
context of what I'm looking for what

5791
03:58:46,199 --> 03:58:48,479
does that mean I stated on the 13th of

5792
03:58:48,479 --> 03:58:51,540
June that I was bearish on dollar and we

5793
03:58:51,540 --> 03:58:53,160
would want to see the British pound

5794
03:58:53,160 --> 03:58:55,199
trade up into

5795
03:58:55,199 --> 03:58:57,899
all of this area here is that's the

5796
03:58:57,899 --> 03:58:59,699
inefficiency from the weekly chart it

5797
03:58:59,699 --> 03:59:02,340
has unfinished business

5798
03:59:02,340 --> 03:59:04,080
well we're seeing it expand up and it's

5799
03:59:04,080 --> 03:59:06,720
done it's done it energetically but

5800
03:59:06,720 --> 03:59:08,760
where did it start on the 14th right

5801
03:59:08,760 --> 03:59:10,620
here at London

5802
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:14,399
and then rallied up we have a wick

5803
03:59:14,399 --> 03:59:16,380
what is the wick doing here

5804
03:59:16,380 --> 03:59:18,180
damage

5805
03:59:18,180 --> 03:59:22,380
damage it trades down outside of that

5806
03:59:22,380 --> 03:59:23,699
Gap

5807
03:59:23,699 --> 03:59:27,620
does it go to some random level

5808
03:59:34,439 --> 03:59:36,720
foreign

5809
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:39,359
got

5810
03:59:39,359 --> 03:59:41,399
that's consequent encroachment

5811
03:59:41,399 --> 03:59:44,760
that's a signature when I see this when

5812
03:59:44,760 --> 03:59:47,100
I see that right there and it pulls back

5813
03:59:47,100 --> 03:59:49,800
up into it I'm still staying with the

5814
03:59:49,800 --> 03:59:51,600
narrative that this is going to go

5815
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:54,779
higher this does not change my mind it

5816
03:59:54,779 --> 03:59:56,880
does not freak me out even this going

5817
03:59:56,880 --> 03:59:59,819
down outside of the Shaded area again

5818
03:59:59,819 --> 04:00:02,939
this is what I refer to as a mohawk a

5819
04:00:02,939 --> 04:00:04,859
little tiny little and the reason why I

5820
04:00:04,859 --> 04:00:07,020
mentioned it to the Mohawk is

5821
04:00:07,020 --> 04:00:09,359
um when you cut your grass

5822
04:00:09,359 --> 04:00:11,040
okay gentlemen

5823
04:00:11,040 --> 04:00:13,859
you got there cutting them on and you're

5824
04:00:13,859 --> 04:00:15,479
listening to the radio you're looking at

5825
04:00:15,479 --> 04:00:16,620
your next generator she's wearing a

5826
04:00:16,620 --> 04:00:19,020
bikini and your wife ain't looking and

5827
04:00:19,020 --> 04:00:21,120
you just move them over too far over and

5828
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:22,800
you leave that little tiny little Mohawk

5829
04:00:22,800 --> 04:00:24,540
you got to come back and and get it well

5830
04:00:24,540 --> 04:00:25,859
that's kind of like what this is it's a

5831
04:00:25,859 --> 04:00:27,840
little tiny little Mohawk outside the

5832
04:00:27,840 --> 04:00:30,420
the range of where you had your Miller

5833
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:32,760
we allow for that okay maybe your wife

5834
04:00:32,760 --> 04:00:33,779
doesn't allow you looking at your

5835
04:00:33,779 --> 04:00:35,520
neighbor in her bikini but we allow this

5836
04:00:35,520 --> 04:00:37,380
in PA this is you know

5837
04:00:37,380 --> 04:00:39,840
permissible for PD

5838
04:00:39,840 --> 04:00:42,960
but notice what's occurring the bodies

5839
04:00:42,960 --> 04:00:44,699
here

5840
04:00:44,699 --> 04:00:46,500
and the body's here

5841
04:00:46,500 --> 04:00:49,020
they're real close to proximity to that

5842
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:51,479
shaded area so we treat this as okay

5843
04:00:51,479 --> 04:00:53,040
it's no problem even though it got real

5844
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:55,080
close to that low the damage was done on

5845
04:00:55,080 --> 04:00:56,340
that Wick

5846
04:00:56,340 --> 04:00:58,620
it returned then to this FVG

5847
04:00:58,620 --> 04:01:00,840
it was consequent encroachment all of

5848
04:01:00,840 --> 04:01:02,760
this in here I would be watching it I

5849
04:01:02,760 --> 04:01:04,439
was not trading it I would be watching

5850
04:01:04,439 --> 04:01:07,439
it and saying okay in my mind

5851
04:01:07,439 --> 04:01:09,720
if we were looking at it live

5852
04:01:09,720 --> 04:01:11,880
you would have seen me type out

5853
04:01:11,880 --> 04:01:15,960
retail sees a Bear Flag drop their

5854
04:01:15,960 --> 04:01:17,819
flag and they would expect it to drop

5855
04:01:17,819 --> 04:01:18,899
down like this

5856
04:01:18,899 --> 04:01:20,699
and that's where I would be drawing in

5857
04:01:20,699 --> 04:01:22,979
or typing in excuse me

5858
04:01:22,979 --> 04:01:26,100
the fake Bear Flag

5859
04:01:26,100 --> 04:01:27,600
so whenever you see me doing examples

5860
04:01:27,600 --> 04:01:29,939
where I talk about what retail sees

5861
04:01:29,939 --> 04:01:31,680
it's in relationship to what I'm showing

5862
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:32,819
you here

5863
04:01:32,819 --> 04:01:35,880
like this is this is real order flow and

5864
04:01:35,880 --> 04:01:37,680
notice I haven't done anything with a

5865
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:40,319
ladder depth of Market level two data no

5866
04:01:40,319 --> 04:01:42,720
profile stuff it's just simply reading

5867
04:01:42,720 --> 04:01:45,180
inefficiencies and liquidity across the

5868
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:47,040
HTF transposed to lower

5869
04:01:47,040 --> 04:01:49,500
time frame staying with that premise

5870
04:01:49,500 --> 04:01:53,220
that dollar goes lower it's risk on all

5871
04:01:53,220 --> 04:01:55,020
assets get to go higher

5872
04:01:55,020 --> 04:01:58,920
stock indices the Forex pairs all that

5873
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:00,960
business they get to go they're free to

5874
04:02:00,960 --> 04:02:03,319
move up

5875
04:02:05,520 --> 04:02:06,960
so here's Thursday two o'clock in the

5876
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:07,920
morning

5877
04:02:07,920 --> 04:02:09,720
it's trading where

5878
04:02:09,720 --> 04:02:13,319
at the low of that Weekly inefficiency

5879
04:02:13,319 --> 04:02:14,760
or Gap

5880
04:02:14,760 --> 04:02:17,040
and then we have the market takeoff

5881
04:02:17,040 --> 04:02:20,040
rally and let's go into a 15-minute time

5882
04:02:20,040 --> 04:02:22,340
frame

5883
04:02:25,859 --> 04:02:28,979
okay so we have more information in here

5884
04:02:28,979 --> 04:02:31,680
this week now has been refined to on a

5885
04:02:31,680 --> 04:02:33,600
15-minute time frame consequent

5886
04:02:33,600 --> 04:02:35,520
encroachments are right about there so

5887
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:37,620
it's treating right at that point

5888
04:02:37,620 --> 04:02:39,960
consolidating just outside that range

5889
04:02:39,960 --> 04:02:43,500
and then we have a short-term High broke

5890
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:44,819
so now we have a shift in Market

5891
04:02:44,819 --> 04:02:47,399
structure at the low

5892
04:02:47,399 --> 04:02:49,680
of that Weekly inefficiency that Fairway

5893
04:02:49,680 --> 04:02:50,640
got

5894
04:02:50,640 --> 04:02:52,319
so the shift in Market structure is

5895
04:02:52,319 --> 04:02:54,859
there a Gap

5896
04:02:57,420 --> 04:03:00,800
look in here is there a Gap

5897
04:03:03,359 --> 04:03:06,479
lowest down close candle

5898
04:03:06,479 --> 04:03:10,439
now the ICT you said you used all the

5899
04:03:10,439 --> 04:03:11,520
candles why don't you use them both

5900
04:03:11,520 --> 04:03:13,560
those candles that candle is outside of

5901
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:15,840
that Gap isn't it outside that shaded

5902
04:03:15,840 --> 04:03:17,580
area

5903
04:03:17,580 --> 04:03:19,560
so what do you do you use the down close

5904
04:03:19,560 --> 04:03:21,720
last one

5905
04:03:21,720 --> 04:03:24,899
you thought you knew under older blocks

5906
04:03:24,899 --> 04:03:28,140
I don't know anything yet

5907
04:03:28,140 --> 04:03:29,880
pull a shorter block

5908
04:03:29,880 --> 04:03:32,399
down close candle trades into it you

5909
04:03:32,399 --> 04:03:34,859
want to see it repel price

5910
04:03:34,859 --> 04:03:37,199
does it repel price yes

5911
04:03:37,199 --> 04:03:39,300
so at this point

5912
04:03:39,300 --> 04:03:41,640
you you can take this entire range now

5913
04:03:41,640 --> 04:03:43,080
for entry you're going to use a down

5914
04:03:43,080 --> 04:03:45,300
close for support whether the

5915
04:03:45,300 --> 04:03:46,620
information is going to continue

5916
04:03:46,620 --> 04:03:49,500
offering institutional sponsorship that

5917
04:03:49,500 --> 04:03:51,120
the price is going to continuously work

5918
04:03:51,120 --> 04:03:53,040
off that level then you can take this

5919
04:03:53,040 --> 04:03:55,020
range and then apply it here but the

5920
04:03:55,020 --> 04:03:56,100
entry would be on that lowest down

5921
04:03:56,100 --> 04:03:57,720
closed candle

5922
04:03:57,720 --> 04:04:00,479
I already hear the people hissing as

5923
04:04:00,479 --> 04:04:02,899
I

5924
04:04:05,399 --> 04:04:07,380
it supports it here supports it here

5925
04:04:07,380 --> 04:04:09,779
look where the bodies are stopping

5926
04:04:09,779 --> 04:04:11,160
see that

5927
04:04:11,160 --> 04:04:13,620
why am I not using this down close cane

5928
04:04:13,620 --> 04:04:15,600
on this down close the ICT it's inside

5929
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:18,479
the Shaded area right of the Gap we have

5930
04:04:18,479 --> 04:04:21,239
to use the out outside of the range

5931
04:04:21,239 --> 04:04:23,220
okay so we're inside of all this

5932
04:04:23,220 --> 04:04:24,899
external range liquidity

5933
04:04:24,899 --> 04:04:26,520
we have to use the PDA rate it's made

5934
04:04:26,520 --> 04:04:28,020
available inside of that and it's

5935
04:04:28,020 --> 04:04:29,699
separated by this down I'm sorry this up

5936
04:04:29,699 --> 04:04:31,319
close candle so that breaks the

5937
04:04:31,319 --> 04:04:34,920
continuity of down close down close up

5938
04:04:34,920 --> 04:04:37,500
close that's a change in estate delivery

5939
04:04:37,500 --> 04:04:39,120
then we go back into down close down

5940
04:04:39,120 --> 04:04:40,140
close

5941
04:04:40,140 --> 04:04:41,699
so the change in the state of delivery

5942
04:04:41,699 --> 04:04:45,180
is the open on this price there

5943
04:04:45,180 --> 04:04:47,220
but for entry purposes we use that last

5944
04:04:47,220 --> 04:04:50,640
down closed candle but for supporting

5945
04:04:50,640 --> 04:04:53,100
for a reclaimed order block

5946
04:04:53,100 --> 04:04:56,640
go back into month four of the ins the

5947
04:04:56,640 --> 04:05:00,060
mentorship these two down closed candles

5948
04:05:00,060 --> 04:05:03,000
it's being reclaimed here and here and

5949
04:05:03,000 --> 04:05:05,460
we can see that the opens and closes

5950
04:05:05,460 --> 04:05:06,359
here

5951
04:05:06,359 --> 04:05:08,100
that's supportive and then we have one

5952
04:05:08,100 --> 04:05:09,540
more little Wick through it because why

5953
04:05:09,540 --> 04:05:12,000
the Wix do the damage you don't rush

5954
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:15,979
your stop loss don't rush it up

5955
04:05:16,500 --> 04:05:19,080
Market breaks above here

5956
04:05:19,080 --> 04:05:22,260
then takes off clears the BS and

5957
04:05:22,260 --> 04:05:25,699
then we get in expanding sense

5958
04:05:27,080 --> 04:05:29,880
so we have a little bit of range still

5959
04:05:29,880 --> 04:05:31,680
here but ultimately we're aiming for

5960
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:33,660
this that's a that's a perfect delivery

5961
04:05:33,660 --> 04:05:35,399
if we can get up to that point will it

5962
04:05:35,399 --> 04:05:37,199
do so before the closer today I don't

5963
04:05:37,199 --> 04:05:38,760
know I don't need to see to do it

5964
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:40,439
because I'm not trading it but you knew

5965
04:05:40,439 --> 04:05:43,979
about it on the 13th of June

5966
04:05:43,979 --> 04:05:48,920
all right so oh yeah

5967
04:05:49,500 --> 04:05:52,140
all right let's go to NASDAQ

5968
04:05:52,140 --> 04:05:54,239
one two three four we only have four

5969
04:05:54,239 --> 04:05:56,580
more markets to cover

5970
04:05:56,580 --> 04:05:59,399
I'll be blending in the FOMC setups and

5971
04:05:59,399 --> 04:06:01,319
and how to trade that stuff as we talk

5972
04:06:01,319 --> 04:06:04,319
about each so

5973
04:06:04,319 --> 04:06:06,720
get back to daily

5974
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:09,720
NASDAQ

5975
04:06:12,420 --> 04:06:14,399
all right so there is the setup that you

5976
04:06:14,399 --> 04:06:16,800
saw me trade yesterday on my cell phone

5977
04:06:16,800 --> 04:06:18,600
so I apologize I know some of you are

5978
04:06:18,600 --> 04:06:19,859
like why don't you record the whole

5979
04:06:19,859 --> 04:06:21,960
thing looking because I had a guy here

5980
04:06:21,960 --> 04:06:23,880
trying to teach me how to use my pull

5981
04:06:23,880 --> 04:06:26,460
and use the setups and such and it's

5982
04:06:26,460 --> 04:06:28,680
something I'm not used to worrying with

5983
04:06:28,680 --> 04:06:30,840
and

5984
04:06:30,840 --> 04:06:32,939
as he's talking to me I told my wife

5985
04:06:32,939 --> 04:06:34,199
said pay attention to this part because

5986
04:06:34,199 --> 04:06:35,939
I'm looking at something

5987
04:06:35,939 --> 04:06:38,640
and I was trading the NASDAQ and I was

5988
04:06:38,640 --> 04:06:39,960
able to capture a little bit of it but

5989
04:06:39,960 --> 04:06:41,939
anyway

5990
04:06:41,939 --> 04:06:43,380
the

5991
04:06:43,380 --> 04:06:46,020
the NASDAQ

5992
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:47,699
let's go back let's take output these

5993
04:06:47,699 --> 04:06:49,260
executions back on in a minute give me a

5994
04:06:49,260 --> 04:06:51,380
second

5995
04:06:54,779 --> 04:06:59,279
so on the 13th of June ahead of CPI I

5996
04:06:59,279 --> 04:07:00,840
mentioned that as I was meaning to

5997
04:07:00,840 --> 04:07:02,699
mention earlier they didn't do so but

5998
04:07:02,699 --> 04:07:04,580
I'm gonna do it here

5999
04:07:04,580 --> 04:07:08,580
CPI number I am generally not accurate

6000
04:07:08,580 --> 04:07:11,640
ahead of it meaning that it's only been

6001
04:07:11,640 --> 04:07:13,920
a few times publicly that I've expected

6002
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:16,199
certain things to unfold in CPI and then

6003
04:07:16,199 --> 04:07:18,899
it happened most of the time I'm wrong

6004
04:07:18,899 --> 04:07:20,640
so does it surprise you when I tell you

6005
04:07:20,640 --> 04:07:22,979
as my students not to try to trade ahead

6006
04:07:22,979 --> 04:07:25,979
of CPI it shouldn't surprise you so

6007
04:07:25,979 --> 04:07:28,560
because I'm telling you not to trade in

6008
04:07:28,560 --> 04:07:31,080
advance of something I'm trying to

6009
04:07:31,080 --> 04:07:32,939
illustrate to you in no uncertain terms

6010
04:07:32,939 --> 04:07:34,859
that there's a great deal of risk in

6011
04:07:34,859 --> 04:07:38,760
doing so so if I'm not able to to do it

6012
04:07:38,760 --> 04:07:40,560
and I'm supposed to be teaching you why

6013
04:07:40,560 --> 04:07:42,899
would you want to trade it you're

6014
04:07:42,899 --> 04:07:46,199
gambling I am gambling if I try to

6015
04:07:46,199 --> 04:07:49,020
determine in advance what it's likely to

6016
04:07:49,020 --> 04:07:51,120
do so I set parameters up like I did on

6017
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:53,160
the 13th I told you where the BS

6018
04:07:53,160 --> 04:07:54,840
and SS was and I'll give you the

6019
04:07:54,840 --> 04:07:56,699
FVG and then as each was

6020
04:07:56,699 --> 04:07:58,140
traded to I told you what would be

6021
04:07:58,140 --> 04:07:59,460
delivered to next so I wanted to

6022
04:07:59,460 --> 04:08:00,600
favorite how you got which we'll look at

6023
04:08:00,600 --> 04:08:01,680
in a minute

6024
04:08:01,680 --> 04:08:03,479
went down the SS real quick all

6025
04:08:03,479 --> 04:08:05,340
in one minute and it went for the buy

6026
04:08:05,340 --> 04:08:07,319
side and I told you it's going to pull

6027
04:08:07,319 --> 04:08:08,760
back into the middle the consequent

6028
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:10,439
crochet of that range that defines both

6029
04:08:10,439 --> 04:08:12,060
the BS and SS and I'm

6030
04:08:12,060 --> 04:08:13,979
probably talking too much for not having

6031
04:08:13,979 --> 04:08:17,340
the chart in front of me but

6032
04:08:17,340 --> 04:08:19,560
the main takeaway was because of it of

6033
04:08:19,560 --> 04:08:22,260
it being ahead of a CPI number I was

6034
04:08:22,260 --> 04:08:24,120
making allowance for

6035
04:08:24,120 --> 04:08:26,939
the SS below here

6036
04:08:26,939 --> 04:08:30,140
which is right

6037
04:08:30,420 --> 04:08:32,399
there on this day

6038
04:08:32,399 --> 04:08:35,160
I was expecting it to be potentially a

6039
04:08:35,160 --> 04:08:37,560
Wipeout where it could come down Spike

6040
04:08:37,560 --> 04:08:39,600
into this

6041
04:08:39,600 --> 04:08:42,060
and still resume going higher I was

6042
04:08:42,060 --> 04:08:43,800
expecting that because it would be a

6043
04:08:43,800 --> 04:08:46,500
classic CPI it's a classic FMC type

6044
04:08:46,500 --> 04:08:48,359
thing it's a classic NFP

6045
04:08:48,359 --> 04:08:51,060
event where they use the smoke screen of

6046
04:08:51,060 --> 04:08:53,220
that high impact news driver

6047
04:08:53,220 --> 04:08:55,920
upset daily liquidity which would you

6048
04:08:55,920 --> 04:08:57,060
know clearly you can see these are

6049
04:08:57,060 --> 04:08:58,199
relatively equal

6050
04:08:58,199 --> 04:09:00,300
so there's a lot of cell stops resting

6051
04:09:00,300 --> 04:09:02,520
it's been trailed up through here so

6052
04:09:02,520 --> 04:09:05,160
that's why I mentioned the CPI could

6053
04:09:05,160 --> 04:09:07,859
potentially use that smoke screen or the

6054
04:09:07,859 --> 04:09:09,060
market rather couldn't use that as a

6055
04:09:09,060 --> 04:09:11,399
smoke screen and drop down air and clear

6056
04:09:11,399 --> 04:09:13,620
up all the cell side here just on a wick

6057
04:09:13,620 --> 04:09:15,300
and then we'd still be where we're at

6058
04:09:15,300 --> 04:09:16,979
here and maybe even higher you know it's

6059
04:09:16,979 --> 04:09:18,060
it's

6060
04:09:18,060 --> 04:09:21,120
it's a scenario I offered up as a reason

6061
04:09:21,120 --> 04:09:23,760
to be cautious

6062
04:09:23,760 --> 04:09:26,760
if you stick to that as what I expected

6063
04:09:26,760 --> 04:09:29,939
for Nasdaq ahead of CPI I was wrong and

6064
04:09:29,939 --> 04:09:32,399
that completely solidifies why I tell

6065
04:09:32,399 --> 04:09:34,199
you don't try to trade ahead of it

6066
04:09:34,199 --> 04:09:36,180
because there's so many variables that

6067
04:09:36,180 --> 04:09:37,500
could take place so many things can

6068
04:09:37,500 --> 04:09:38,399
happen

6069
04:09:38,399 --> 04:09:40,439
nobody really knows what it's going to

6070
04:09:40,439 --> 04:09:42,120
do when it happens and when it does

6071
04:09:42,120 --> 04:09:43,560
happen I showed you and you watched it

6072
04:09:43,560 --> 04:09:44,880
live it was over in there and if you

6073
04:09:44,880 --> 04:09:47,520
didn't see it live it's in the recording

6074
04:09:47,520 --> 04:09:50,880
it's moving and traversing so fast

6075
04:09:50,880 --> 04:09:52,560
that there's no way you're getting

6076
04:09:52,560 --> 04:09:54,420
filled and all Brokers pull liquidity

6077
04:09:54,420 --> 04:09:56,220
you're not allowed to trade that because

6078
04:09:56,220 --> 04:09:57,660
like I mentioned at the time in that

6079
04:09:57,660 --> 04:09:59,840
live stream it opens them up to

6080
04:09:59,840 --> 04:10:01,859
unnecessary risk

6081
04:10:01,859 --> 04:10:04,380
so they claim that there's a absence of

6082
04:10:04,380 --> 04:10:05,939
liquidity like Traders aren't willing to

6083
04:10:05,939 --> 04:10:07,140
trade it there's a lot of people out

6084
04:10:07,140 --> 04:10:09,359
there trying to gamble on it

6085
04:10:09,359 --> 04:10:11,640
but they don't want the likelihood of

6086
04:10:11,640 --> 04:10:14,340
some yahoo getting lucky with an over

6087
04:10:14,340 --> 04:10:16,859
leveraged trade that they're be booking

6088
04:10:16,859 --> 04:10:18,660
and B booking is when a broker trades

6089
04:10:18,660 --> 04:10:21,660
against you and yes it does go on but

6090
04:10:21,660 --> 04:10:23,160
you know if you learn how to trade ball

6091
04:10:23,160 --> 04:10:26,040
you don't need to worry about that

6092
04:10:26,040 --> 04:10:27,840
so here we have

6093
04:10:27,840 --> 04:10:30,439
um Thursday today and here's Wednesday

6094
04:10:30,439 --> 04:10:34,800
Tuesday the 13th as I was mentioning I

6095
04:10:34,800 --> 04:10:36,720
was expecting some

6096
04:10:36,720 --> 04:10:39,840
some wild whips or NCP I can can do

6097
04:10:39,840 --> 04:10:42,180
those types of things but it was kind of

6098
04:10:42,180 --> 04:10:44,939
muted to the downside and offered still

6099
04:10:44,939 --> 04:10:47,040
continuation you know up

6100
04:10:47,040 --> 04:10:49,319
so we're going to drop into a 60 Minute

6101
04:10:49,319 --> 04:10:51,680
chart

6102
04:10:53,580 --> 04:10:56,100
okay and you can see how this type of

6103
04:10:56,100 --> 04:10:58,279
move right here

6104
04:10:58,279 --> 04:11:02,580
FMC CPI NFP all those

6105
04:11:02,580 --> 04:11:05,760
things tend they tend to be a

6106
04:11:05,760 --> 04:11:07,739
characteristic of those types of new

6107
04:11:07,739 --> 04:11:10,260
drivers new drivers so a high impact

6108
04:11:10,260 --> 04:11:13,020
news driver for your notes

6109
04:11:13,020 --> 04:11:13,760
um

6110
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:16,080
it can occur on a medium impact news

6111
04:11:16,080 --> 04:11:18,420
driver but most of the time the high

6112
04:11:18,420 --> 04:11:21,359
impact news driver is when I expect the

6113
04:11:21,359 --> 04:11:24,660
worst case scenario in terms of where

6114
04:11:24,660 --> 04:11:26,340
the safest

6115
04:11:26,340 --> 04:11:29,220
retail spot of anyone that's an open

6116
04:11:29,220 --> 04:11:31,439
profit meaning the Market's been going

6117
04:11:31,439 --> 04:11:33,779
higher this is a general rule of thumb

6118
04:11:33,779 --> 04:11:35,520
so we're not really talking about this

6119
04:11:35,520 --> 04:11:37,920
Market Per Se it's every Market if the

6120
04:11:37,920 --> 04:11:40,260
market has been going up for a while and

6121
04:11:40,260 --> 04:11:41,399
it's been

6122
04:11:41,399 --> 04:11:43,560
classically seen as a uptrend everybody

6123
04:11:43,560 --> 04:11:46,620
that's long should be in profit a high

6124
04:11:46,620 --> 04:11:48,840
impact news driver my mindset is always

6125
04:11:48,840 --> 04:11:51,180
it's going to run against that

6126
04:11:51,180 --> 04:11:55,319
either to reverse on them or to offset

6127
04:11:55,319 --> 04:11:58,560
any trailed stop losses so that way they

6128
04:11:58,560 --> 04:12:01,439
can be utilized to be a counterparty and

6129
04:12:01,439 --> 04:12:03,779
then resume that existing primary

6130
04:12:03,779 --> 04:12:04,920
uptrend

6131
04:12:04,920 --> 04:12:08,340
so I'm always looking at these high

6132
04:12:08,340 --> 04:12:10,920
impact news drivers to go after for the

6133
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:13,380
purposes of unseeding profitable

6134
04:12:13,380 --> 04:12:17,580
positions and then it resumes but if it

6135
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:20,640
reverses I'll know if it's a reversal at

6136
04:12:20,640 --> 04:12:22,620
the time of delivery so that's why I

6137
04:12:22,620 --> 04:12:25,199
have to wait I have to wait for CPI I

6138
04:12:25,199 --> 04:12:27,720
have to wait for FOMC I have to wait for

6139
04:12:27,720 --> 04:12:29,699
a NFP if I'm going to trade

6140
04:12:29,699 --> 04:12:31,399
them

6141
04:12:31,399 --> 04:12:34,620
MythBusters ICT Edition you know you see

6142
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:36,300
people say ICT says never trade on

6143
04:12:36,300 --> 04:12:38,279
Mondays no I tell you as a new student

6144
04:12:38,279 --> 04:12:39,899
learning don't trade on Mondays let

6145
04:12:39,899 --> 04:12:41,640
Monday trade use the information that

6146
04:12:41,640 --> 04:12:43,380
you get once you know how to trade you

6147
04:12:43,380 --> 04:12:45,540
can trade Mondays all day long

6148
04:12:45,540 --> 04:12:47,939
okay that's the proper context of what I

6149
04:12:47,939 --> 04:12:50,880
said I teach my students don't try to

6150
04:12:50,880 --> 04:12:52,380
trade NFP

6151
04:12:52,380 --> 04:12:54,300
but you can trade after non-front

6152
04:12:54,300 --> 04:12:55,920
payroll about 30 minutes after non-front

6153
04:12:55,920 --> 04:12:58,500
payroll yeah you can trade the gas the

6154
04:12:58,500 --> 04:13:00,120
inefficiencies in the liquidity it's

6155
04:13:00,120 --> 04:13:04,080
easy to trade it after but it's next to

6156
04:13:04,080 --> 04:13:06,000
impossible for you as a new student or

6157
04:13:06,000 --> 04:13:08,520
new Trader to feel confident or

6158
04:13:08,520 --> 04:13:10,080
consistent trading non-trump payroll

6159
04:13:10,080 --> 04:13:11,819
when you don't have experience doesn't

6160
04:13:11,819 --> 04:13:13,620
that sound like a responsible person if

6161
04:13:13,620 --> 04:13:15,420
I'm trying to teach you if you're

6162
04:13:15,420 --> 04:13:16,819
learning something from someone

6163
04:13:16,819 --> 04:13:20,460
especially if you paid to learn this

6164
04:13:20,460 --> 04:13:22,739
wouldn't you want that person to guide

6165
04:13:22,739 --> 04:13:24,899
you away from where you're probably

6166
04:13:24,899 --> 04:13:26,160
going to hurt yourself

6167
04:13:26,160 --> 04:13:28,140
that's what I'm trying to be as a mentor

6168
04:13:28,140 --> 04:13:30,000
that's what I've always maintained

6169
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:32,819
same way with CPI CPI can rip your head

6170
04:13:32,819 --> 04:13:35,100
off and shove it straight up your ass if

6171
04:13:35,100 --> 04:13:36,899
you're wrong that's the reality of that

6172
04:13:36,899 --> 04:13:40,680
it's so violent so quick if you're wrong

6173
04:13:40,680 --> 04:13:43,800
it's unforgiving the broker's not going

6174
04:13:43,800 --> 04:13:46,620
to say well I'm sorry no they're going

6175
04:13:46,620 --> 04:13:48,660
to give you the worst case Phil your

6176
04:13:48,660 --> 04:13:50,220
stop is not going to protect you it's

6177
04:13:50,220 --> 04:13:52,560
going to be the worst case scenario

6178
04:13:52,560 --> 04:13:54,960
and it's probably going to be a instance

6179
04:13:54,960 --> 04:13:56,279
where you wish this thought would have

6180
04:13:56,279 --> 04:13:58,260
worked and it's running even past your

6181
04:13:58,260 --> 04:13:59,580
stop

6182
04:13:59,580 --> 04:14:03,840
and by the time they remove all the

6183
04:14:03,840 --> 04:14:05,160
the

6184
04:14:05,160 --> 04:14:08,040
self-imposed lack of liquidity

6185
04:14:08,040 --> 04:14:09,840
you'll get filled at the most ill

6186
04:14:09,840 --> 04:14:12,479
position or or price

6187
04:14:12,479 --> 04:14:14,880
that's the way it works so because I've

6188
04:14:14,880 --> 04:14:17,460
seen this for so many years and I've had

6189
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:20,100
my own experiences where getting smashed

6190
04:14:20,100 --> 04:14:22,020
around my face ripped off or my head

6191
04:14:22,020 --> 04:14:24,000
shot up my own ass that type of

6192
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:26,520
experience doesn't need to be repeated

6193
04:14:26,520 --> 04:14:28,439
not in my students so I'm trying to

6194
04:14:28,439 --> 04:14:30,260
teach you how to avoid all that stuff

6195
04:14:30,260 --> 04:14:34,260
and it should be received with

6196
04:14:34,260 --> 04:14:36,840
gratitude because I wish I would have

6197
04:14:36,840 --> 04:14:38,460
had someone tell me this stuff and save

6198
04:14:38,460 --> 04:14:40,739
me all this pain because it was very

6199
04:14:40,739 --> 04:14:43,560
very painful and

6200
04:14:43,560 --> 04:14:45,300
troubling the the wreck myself

6201
04:14:45,300 --> 04:14:48,660
constantly not knowing that

6202
04:14:48,660 --> 04:14:50,040
at the time I felt like I was gonna be

6203
04:14:50,040 --> 04:14:51,359
right

6204
04:14:51,359 --> 04:14:52,560
and you're gonna have those instances

6205
04:14:52,560 --> 04:14:54,779
even learning with my Concepts you're

6206
04:14:54,779 --> 04:14:56,399
going to get overconfident

6207
04:14:56,399 --> 04:14:58,439
it's gonna happen it happens all the

6208
04:14:58,439 --> 04:15:01,199
time my students they get this sense of

6209
04:15:01,199 --> 04:15:03,359
invincibility

6210
04:15:03,359 --> 04:15:06,840
they're invulnerable they can't they

6211
04:15:06,840 --> 04:15:08,220
can't do it wrong now they figured it

6212
04:15:08,220 --> 04:15:09,840
out they cracked the algorithm

6213
04:15:09,840 --> 04:15:11,520
and then all of a sudden you get that

6214
04:15:11,520 --> 04:15:13,859
one simple stupid little losing trade

6215
04:15:13,859 --> 04:15:16,140
and it's always going to be on a high

6216
04:15:16,140 --> 04:15:17,580
impact or a medium impact news driver

6217
04:15:17,580 --> 04:15:19,020
where you thought you were going to do

6218
04:15:19,020 --> 04:15:20,880
better than the rules and I make that

6219
04:15:20,880 --> 04:15:23,220
same mistake when I lose it's me most of

6220
04:15:23,220 --> 04:15:26,279
the time always me

6221
04:15:26,279 --> 04:15:29,340
trying to outperform my own algorithm

6222
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:32,100
because I've been here before this looks

6223
04:15:32,100 --> 04:15:34,020
like a time it's it's the human element

6224
04:15:34,020 --> 04:15:35,340
that Creeps in

6225
04:15:35,340 --> 04:15:37,560
so the more rigid you are about filing

6226
04:15:37,560 --> 04:15:40,140
rules that are not infinite in the list

6227
04:15:40,140 --> 04:15:41,760
simple little rules

6228
04:15:41,760 --> 04:15:43,380
simple little rules the things that I

6229
04:15:43,380 --> 04:15:44,819
outlined when I tell you look for this

6230
04:15:44,819 --> 04:15:48,239
level to act as a means for a premium to

6231
04:15:48,239 --> 04:15:50,220
then distribute price lower to this

6232
04:15:50,220 --> 04:15:52,260
discount okay that's pretty simple it's

6233
04:15:52,260 --> 04:15:54,420
giving you a framework then you simply

6234
04:15:54,420 --> 04:15:56,460
wait for time I've told you the times

6235
04:15:56,460 --> 04:15:58,080
they were waiting for it but now we're

6236
04:15:58,080 --> 04:16:00,720
in stock indices so it changes a little

6237
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:03,540
bit okay it starts at 8 30.

6238
04:16:03,540 --> 04:16:05,460
and goes to 11. there's your morning

6239
04:16:05,460 --> 04:16:06,899
session then you have to worry about

6240
04:16:06,899 --> 04:16:08,279
trading the lunch are you a lunchtime

6241
04:16:08,279 --> 04:16:10,199
Trader yes you can trade lunch you've

6242
04:16:10,199 --> 04:16:11,760
watched me whip this out of these

6243
04:16:11,760 --> 04:16:14,040
markets trade in that lunch hour but as

6244
04:16:14,040 --> 04:16:16,439
a new Trader you shouldn't try to do

6245
04:16:16,439 --> 04:16:18,180
that yet stick to the morning session

6246
04:16:18,180 --> 04:16:20,699
then trade the afternoon session or one

6247
04:16:20,699 --> 04:16:22,199
or the other if you make money in the

6248
04:16:22,199 --> 04:16:23,880
morning don't trade the afternoon as a

6249
04:16:23,880 --> 04:16:25,859
new student that doesn't mean everybody

6250
04:16:25,859 --> 04:16:27,600
stops trading and don't trade the

6251
04:16:27,600 --> 04:16:29,220
afternoon session because they made

6252
04:16:29,220 --> 04:16:32,939
money ict's giving you

6253
04:16:32,939 --> 04:16:35,340
whatever because they want to cherry

6254
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:37,500
pick things out of context I'm telling

6255
04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:41,340
the new students don't try to do a lot

6256
04:16:41,340 --> 04:16:44,279
try to find one good setup per week and

6257
04:16:44,279 --> 04:16:46,260
then build on that over time

6258
04:16:46,260 --> 04:16:48,720
you can see clearly there's a lot of

6259
04:16:48,720 --> 04:16:49,800
opportunity

6260
04:16:49,800 --> 04:16:52,439
lots of opportunity to find setups after

6261
04:16:52,439 --> 04:16:55,500
setup after setup but if you feel like a

6262
04:16:55,500 --> 04:16:57,899
kid in a candy store

6263
04:16:57,899 --> 04:16:59,760
you're gonna you're gonna try to do

6264
04:16:59,760 --> 04:17:01,020
everything

6265
04:17:01,020 --> 04:17:04,020
and that's not a good thing

6266
04:17:04,020 --> 04:17:07,080
you want to just pick your shots know

6267
04:17:07,080 --> 04:17:09,300
what you're trying to do and focus on

6268
04:17:09,300 --> 04:17:10,439
that only

6269
04:17:10,439 --> 04:17:12,000
and that's what these discussions help

6270
04:17:12,000 --> 04:17:12,899
you

6271
04:17:12,899 --> 04:17:15,359
be reminded of because it's very easy

6272
04:17:15,359 --> 04:17:16,800
once you start making money whether it

6273
04:17:16,800 --> 04:17:20,479
be in a demo or funded account or live

6274
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:22,140
you get drunk

6275
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:25,319
like you get drunk on winning and you

6276
04:17:25,319 --> 04:17:26,760
think that it's oh I can go on here

6277
04:17:26,760 --> 04:17:28,800
again right now it's still running let

6278
04:17:28,800 --> 04:17:30,300
me get in there again oh it's still got

6279
04:17:30,300 --> 04:17:31,800
some more juicing let me get it and then

6280
04:17:31,800 --> 04:17:34,859
that's it you give it all back and more

6281
04:17:34,859 --> 04:17:37,140
and then you're mad at yourself you get

6282
04:17:37,140 --> 04:17:38,760
mad at me because you think I caused

6283
04:17:38,760 --> 04:17:40,680
this you brought on yourself

6284
04:17:40,680 --> 04:17:42,600
if you didn't listen to the dry points

6285
04:17:42,600 --> 04:17:44,399
and the boring parts that's why you

6286
04:17:44,399 --> 04:17:45,960
wrecking yourself

6287
04:17:45,960 --> 04:17:48,120
and if you've wrecked yourself go back

6288
04:17:48,120 --> 04:17:49,500
and listen to those boring parts of the

6289
04:17:49,500 --> 04:17:51,000
lectures because that's the that

6290
04:17:51,000 --> 04:17:53,040
keeps you on the straight and narrow

6291
04:17:53,040 --> 04:17:56,580
so anyway here's NASDAQ hourly chart

6292
04:17:56,580 --> 04:17:58,260
and

6293
04:17:58,260 --> 04:18:00,359
where are we at here

6294
04:18:00,359 --> 04:18:02,520
8 am

6295
04:18:02,520 --> 04:18:05,300
so we have

6296
04:18:05,939 --> 04:18:09,859
this big wick here on the hourly chart

6297
04:18:14,819 --> 04:18:17,040
I figure out what this

6298
04:18:17,040 --> 04:18:19,920
is here

6299
04:18:19,920 --> 04:18:23,239
I'll bring it back up in a second

6300
04:18:23,640 --> 04:18:27,180
body to low and I had the gradients in

6301
04:18:27,180 --> 04:18:30,000
here okay so we can see to midpoint

6302
04:18:30,000 --> 04:18:32,160
which is consequent corrosion of a wick

6303
04:18:32,160 --> 04:18:34,560
or tail for your notes I failed to

6304
04:18:34,560 --> 04:18:36,239
mention this earlier I apologize for the

6305
04:18:36,239 --> 04:18:39,000
folks that don't know I treat every one

6306
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:41,880
of these tails in wicks

6307
04:18:41,880 --> 04:18:44,160
I treat them the same way as I do with a

6308
04:18:44,160 --> 04:18:44,880
gap

6309
04:18:44,880 --> 04:18:48,060
okay the algorithm refers to that area

6310
04:18:48,060 --> 04:18:50,939
as a inefficiency or a gap so it's

6311
04:18:50,939 --> 04:18:52,920
treated the same way midpoint is

6312
04:18:52,920 --> 04:18:55,199
consequent encroachment

6313
04:18:55,199 --> 04:18:57,960
and if we are looking at this this Wick

6314
04:18:57,960 --> 04:18:59,640
here or tail

6315
04:18:59,640 --> 04:19:02,100
the low

6316
04:19:02,100 --> 04:19:04,920
for maintaining bullishness would be

6317
04:19:04,920 --> 04:19:06,779
consequent corrosion which was fifteen

6318
04:19:06,779 --> 04:19:08,819
thousand fifty four and a half

6319
04:19:08,819 --> 04:19:11,460
so as long as price does not close below

6320
04:19:11,460 --> 04:19:12,479
that

6321
04:19:12,479 --> 04:19:15,660
everything stays bullish

6322
04:19:15,660 --> 04:19:17,939
The best scenario for continuation on

6323
04:19:17,939 --> 04:19:21,120
the upside would be from the high of the

6324
04:19:21,120 --> 04:19:23,640
Wicks or the tail here down to

6325
04:19:23,640 --> 04:19:25,439
consequent encroachment

6326
04:19:25,439 --> 04:19:28,739
look at the bodies respecting the upper

6327
04:19:28,739 --> 04:19:30,300
quadrant

6328
04:19:30,300 --> 04:19:34,140
of this entirety of this of this Tale

6329
04:19:34,140 --> 04:19:36,479
there's the upper percentage of it or a

6330
04:19:36,479 --> 04:19:37,920
quarter of it look where the bodies are

6331
04:19:37,920 --> 04:19:39,239
stopping

6332
04:19:39,239 --> 04:19:41,580
the Wicks do the damage

6333
04:19:41,580 --> 04:19:43,439
so when I'm watching price I don't have

6334
04:19:43,439 --> 04:19:45,060
a fib

6335
04:19:45,060 --> 04:19:48,239
on the Wicks I'm looking at it okay and

6336
04:19:48,239 --> 04:19:49,859
I'm just eyeballing it roughing it like

6337
04:19:49,859 --> 04:19:51,540
this when you're watching me do

6338
04:19:51,540 --> 04:19:52,140
um

6339
04:19:52,140 --> 04:19:54,840
executions when I'm reading PA

6340
04:19:54,840 --> 04:19:57,300
live Kayla by Candle by candle and I may

6341
04:19:57,300 --> 04:19:59,520
not go into the details like this

6342
04:19:59,520 --> 04:20:01,140
I'm looking at that and saying okay

6343
04:20:01,140 --> 04:20:03,479
roughly that's about half

6344
04:20:03,479 --> 04:20:05,279
and then what's half of that to the

6345
04:20:05,279 --> 04:20:08,160
upside what about here and I'm watching

6346
04:20:08,160 --> 04:20:10,439
these candles as it happens in this

6347
04:20:10,439 --> 04:20:12,600
instance or anything similar to it

6348
04:20:12,600 --> 04:20:16,020
are the bodies stopping at or real close

6349
04:20:16,020 --> 04:20:19,439
to the upper quarter or half if we start

6350
04:20:19,439 --> 04:20:22,500
seeing a body going down into the 50 or

6351
04:20:22,500 --> 04:20:23,760
consequent encouragement and starts

6352
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:25,739
going lower or a close rate on the

6353
04:20:25,739 --> 04:20:27,239
consequent encroachment that's a warning

6354
04:20:27,239 --> 04:20:29,640
sign to me I'm thinking okay this is

6355
04:20:29,640 --> 04:20:30,720
probably going to give up the goods and

6356
04:20:30,720 --> 04:20:31,979
go lower

6357
04:20:31,979 --> 04:20:34,140
but simply because these two lows here

6358
04:20:34,140 --> 04:20:36,720
are in close proximity that's not enough

6359
04:20:36,720 --> 04:20:38,939
to Warrant that this drop here is going

6360
04:20:38,939 --> 04:20:40,080
to keep on going

6361
04:20:40,080 --> 04:20:42,899
I'm looking at all these tails

6362
04:20:42,899 --> 04:20:44,939
and I'm measuring the willingness of the

6363
04:20:44,939 --> 04:20:46,080
bodies

6364
04:20:46,080 --> 04:20:49,680
to close and or open at their respective

6365
04:20:49,680 --> 04:20:53,279
either the quarter percent or half you

6366
04:20:53,279 --> 04:20:54,960
know it's consequent encroachment or the

6367
04:20:54,960 --> 04:20:57,420
upper quadrant not wanting to see the

6368
04:20:57,420 --> 04:20:59,580
lower quadrant even ever being Revisited

6369
04:20:59,580 --> 04:21:01,620
and we're not seeing that here

6370
04:21:01,620 --> 04:21:03,300
and the market does in fact tear up

6371
04:21:03,300 --> 04:21:05,340
higher so it's one of the things I'm

6372
04:21:05,340 --> 04:21:07,020
using and utilizing while I'm reading

6373
04:21:07,020 --> 04:21:08,640
price and tape reading with you all or

6374
04:21:08,640 --> 04:21:10,199
if I'm watching price on Twitter and I'm

6375
04:21:10,199 --> 04:21:12,779
calling things out I'm looking at all

6376
04:21:12,779 --> 04:21:16,580
these things and weighing it all out

6377
04:21:17,819 --> 04:21:21,180
okay so we have a bounce price range in

6378
04:21:21,180 --> 04:21:22,319
here

6379
04:21:22,319 --> 04:21:25,439
a balanced price range okay what is a

6380
04:21:25,439 --> 04:21:27,779
balanced price range it comes in many

6381
04:21:27,779 --> 04:21:30,359
forms I shouldn't say many it comes in a

6382
04:21:30,359 --> 04:21:33,300
couple forms but as I was mentioning

6383
04:21:33,300 --> 04:21:36,120
earlier in the workshop video today we

6384
04:21:36,120 --> 04:21:38,699
have talked about how markets stay in a

6385
04:21:38,699 --> 04:21:39,840
Range

6386
04:21:39,840 --> 04:21:42,180
and when they leave that range because

6387
04:21:42,180 --> 04:21:44,460
upside and downside has been delivered

6388
04:21:44,460 --> 04:21:46,800
on price

6389
04:21:46,800 --> 04:21:48,779
it makes it a balanced price range what

6390
04:21:48,779 --> 04:21:50,399
happens when it's done over the course

6391
04:21:50,399 --> 04:21:53,160
of a couple candles and not a multitude

6392
04:21:53,160 --> 04:21:54,300
of candles

6393
04:21:54,300 --> 04:21:57,779
think about it like this if I was in a

6394
04:21:57,779 --> 04:22:00,000
a live setting say if I was on a stadium

6395
04:22:00,000 --> 04:22:02,880
or not that's the main stadium if I was

6396
04:22:02,880 --> 04:22:04,800
on stage okay and I was in a room full

6397
04:22:04,800 --> 04:22:07,859
out of you okay I would right now ask by

6398
04:22:07,859 --> 04:22:09,479
a show of hands by raising your hand up

6399
04:22:09,479 --> 04:22:10,979
and you don't need to do it I can't see

6400
04:22:10,979 --> 04:22:12,540
you and there's something you're gonna

6401
04:22:12,540 --> 04:22:15,720
do it raise your hand if you have been

6402
04:22:15,720 --> 04:22:17,340
in trading long enough to remember what

6403
04:22:17,340 --> 04:22:19,260
a key reversal is

6404
04:22:19,260 --> 04:22:22,439
okay a key reversal would be a day where

6405
04:22:22,439 --> 04:22:24,720
it's like this

6406
04:22:24,720 --> 04:22:26,100
and

6407
04:22:26,100 --> 04:22:29,040
this right here all of this movement

6408
04:22:29,040 --> 04:22:31,979
here would be absent from the chart

6409
04:22:31,979 --> 04:22:33,540
and you would just see the market would

6410
04:22:33,540 --> 04:22:35,220
be here one day and then the next day

6411
04:22:35,220 --> 04:22:37,140
would be gap down here and then the next

6412
04:22:37,140 --> 04:22:38,880
day it would be gapped up here

6413
04:22:38,880 --> 04:22:40,800
all of this movement would be invisible

6414
04:22:40,800 --> 04:22:42,540
all of this movement would be invisible

6415
04:22:42,540 --> 04:22:44,399
it would just be looking just like that

6416
04:22:44,399 --> 04:22:48,540
okay that is a key reversal or

6417
04:22:48,540 --> 04:22:51,060
a island reversal

6418
04:22:51,060 --> 04:22:53,880
very very classic old school dinosaur

6419
04:22:53,880 --> 04:22:56,340
type of trading and

6420
04:22:56,340 --> 04:22:59,340
that is essentially what I'm trying to

6421
04:22:59,340 --> 04:23:01,380
take your attention to because that

6422
04:23:01,380 --> 04:23:04,199
element of separation

6423
04:23:04,199 --> 04:23:06,359
that

6424
04:23:06,359 --> 04:23:09,060
once price goes to an extreme

6425
04:23:09,060 --> 04:23:10,439
which is what it's doing here because

6426
04:23:10,439 --> 04:23:12,600
see what we have here we have a low

6427
04:23:12,600 --> 04:23:14,880
we run through that low and we do it on

6428
04:23:14,880 --> 04:23:17,100
a very large candle and then we come

6429
04:23:17,100 --> 04:23:18,660
back all the way back over top of that

6430
04:23:18,660 --> 04:23:19,620
again

6431
04:23:19,620 --> 04:23:23,340
so these two candles right here

6432
04:23:23,340 --> 04:23:25,439
this represents a balanced price range

6433
04:23:25,439 --> 04:23:28,140
because it's reached down to a level and

6434
04:23:28,140 --> 04:23:30,180
it's offered on one single pass all this

6435
04:23:30,180 --> 04:23:32,460
move and the next candle over here one

6436
04:23:32,460 --> 04:23:34,319
single pass so the way I do this and I

6437
04:23:34,319 --> 04:23:36,420
Define it is this

6438
04:23:36,420 --> 04:23:39,779
which Which is higher

6439
04:23:39,779 --> 04:23:42,479
this candle's low

6440
04:23:42,479 --> 04:23:44,760
that moves back inside of this up move

6441
04:23:44,760 --> 04:23:48,239
of this candle excuse me

6442
04:23:48,239 --> 04:23:50,399
get this down close I'm sorry this down

6443
04:23:50,399 --> 04:23:52,260
movement on this candle

6444
04:23:52,260 --> 04:23:55,020
eats into this up close candle but only

6445
04:23:55,020 --> 04:23:56,819
to this point

6446
04:23:56,819 --> 04:24:00,600
this low or this low which one's higher

6447
04:24:00,600 --> 04:24:03,180
clearly this one

6448
04:24:03,180 --> 04:24:04,920
this is the only

6449
04:24:04,920 --> 04:24:07,500
candle that is defined

6450
04:24:07,500 --> 04:24:09,960
in the range that this candle goes lower

6451
04:24:09,960 --> 04:24:11,939
and this candle goes lower so what I'm

6452
04:24:11,939 --> 04:24:14,220
saying is the range is from here

6453
04:24:14,220 --> 04:24:17,580
to here extend it out okay so this makes

6454
04:24:17,580 --> 04:24:19,859
a balanced price range

6455
04:24:19,859 --> 04:24:22,500
all of this in here I don't care about

6456
04:24:22,500 --> 04:24:24,600
I could care less about that

6457
04:24:24,600 --> 04:24:29,359
what I'm looking at is this relationship

6458
04:24:32,220 --> 04:24:35,580
I'm not sure there must be the outline

6459
04:24:35,580 --> 04:24:36,960
yeah it is

6460
04:24:36,960 --> 04:24:40,399
so it's the bottom line

6461
04:24:41,640 --> 04:24:44,600
right

6462
04:24:54,840 --> 04:24:57,060
there we go so that's the balance price

6463
04:24:57,060 --> 04:24:58,260
range here

6464
04:24:58,260 --> 04:25:00,899
and what I'm what I'm trying to convey

6465
04:25:00,899 --> 04:25:01,920
to you

6466
04:25:01,920 --> 04:25:05,040
is that because we had single pass down

6467
04:25:05,040 --> 04:25:07,020
single pass up

6468
04:25:07,020 --> 04:25:09,600
this is balanced now once we leave it

6469
04:25:09,600 --> 04:25:12,720
here what that means is this range you

6470
04:25:12,720 --> 04:25:15,300
define it by what I just showed you here

6471
04:25:15,300 --> 04:25:18,540
the highest and the lowest extreme

6472
04:25:18,540 --> 04:25:21,300
between both of these up close and down

6473
04:25:21,300 --> 04:25:23,520
close candles this entirety of that

6474
04:25:23,520 --> 04:25:25,819
range

6475
04:25:26,939 --> 04:25:28,500
low

6476
04:25:28,500 --> 04:25:30,660
to high where are the bodies of the

6477
04:25:30,660 --> 04:25:33,060
candles over here stopping

6478
04:25:33,060 --> 04:25:36,000
kind of is some serious there ain't

6479
04:25:36,000 --> 04:25:36,720
it

6480
04:25:36,720 --> 04:25:38,340
that's algorithmic

6481
04:25:38,340 --> 04:25:40,800
all the bodies of these candles here are

6482
04:25:40,800 --> 04:25:43,020
respecting the midpoint of this balanced

6483
04:25:43,020 --> 04:25:45,420
price range how the can you go back

6484
04:25:45,420 --> 04:25:47,340
through any retail stuff and see this

6485
04:25:47,340 --> 04:25:49,140
being taught anywhere else it's not it's

6486
04:25:49,140 --> 04:25:51,620
not anywhere

6487
04:25:52,080 --> 04:25:54,659
these are things that you wouldn't learn

6488
04:25:54,659 --> 04:25:57,479
by any book none of that exists

6489
04:25:57,479 --> 04:26:02,060
anywhere this is stuff that's authorship

6490
04:26:06,600 --> 04:26:09,080
oh

6491
04:26:12,060 --> 04:26:13,979
so when I'm watching a balanced price

6492
04:26:13,979 --> 04:26:15,840
range or if I make mention of a balanced

6493
04:26:15,840 --> 04:26:18,000
price range what I'm suggesting to you

6494
04:26:18,000 --> 04:26:22,140
is that there is a definitive boundary

6495
04:26:22,140 --> 04:26:24,120
that at which I don't want to see

6496
04:26:24,120 --> 04:26:25,380
breached

6497
04:26:25,380 --> 04:26:27,600
on a

6498
04:26:27,600 --> 04:26:30,659
on a candle's body okay I don't want to

6499
04:26:30,659 --> 04:26:33,540
see it move Beyond this in this case we

6500
04:26:33,540 --> 04:26:35,760
were looking for what for

6501
04:26:35,760 --> 04:26:39,840
dollar move lower so a lower movement

6502
04:26:39,840 --> 04:26:42,359
dollar is what in other asset classes

6503
04:26:42,359 --> 04:26:45,960
risk on risk on is dollar lower so

6504
04:26:45,960 --> 04:26:48,659
dollar lower all foreign currency higher

6505
04:26:48,659 --> 04:26:50,760
and it gives the freedom for stock

6506
04:26:50,760 --> 04:26:53,939
indices to go higher knowing that the

6507
04:26:53,939 --> 04:26:56,460
dollar Index and index Futures are not

6508
04:26:56,460 --> 04:26:59,819
locked step you every Point higher is a

6509
04:26:59,819 --> 04:27:01,620
lower move in this or that it doesn't

6510
04:27:01,620 --> 04:27:04,560
move like that okay much like

6511
04:27:04,560 --> 04:27:05,399
um

6512
04:27:05,399 --> 04:27:08,399
when I taught bonds and the yields how

6513
04:27:08,399 --> 04:27:10,680
the yields will move

6514
04:27:10,680 --> 04:27:14,699
and they'll cause a long-term effect on

6515
04:27:14,699 --> 04:27:16,260
foreign currency

6516
04:27:16,260 --> 04:27:17,520
because they're going to chase that

6517
04:27:17,520 --> 04:27:20,699
yield but the yields can change

6518
04:27:20,699 --> 04:27:23,279
and the delay between all of that

6519
04:27:23,279 --> 04:27:26,220
shifting in the currency

6520
04:27:26,220 --> 04:27:28,439
it's not an immediate thing just like

6521
04:27:28,439 --> 04:27:30,060
commitment of Traders net Trader

6522
04:27:30,060 --> 04:27:32,640
Physicians just because the commercials

6523
04:27:32,640 --> 04:27:35,460
are net long doesn't necessarily mean

6524
04:27:35,460 --> 04:27:37,560
it's time for you to go long

6525
04:27:37,560 --> 04:27:40,439
so there's rules to all these things and

6526
04:27:40,439 --> 04:27:41,580
that's why it's important not just to

6527
04:27:41,580 --> 04:27:43,319
Simply watch one video or one lecture

6528
04:27:43,319 --> 04:27:44,699
and think you come away with

6529
04:27:44,699 --> 04:27:46,319
understanding it it doesn't work that

6530
04:27:46,319 --> 04:27:47,100
way

6531
04:27:47,100 --> 04:27:48,540
but

6532
04:27:48,540 --> 04:27:51,659
when I give a boundary to a Marketplace

6533
04:27:51,659 --> 04:27:53,880
and I code in a limitation of how far

6534
04:27:53,880 --> 04:27:57,060
the Market's going to go it's limited to

6535
04:27:57,060 --> 04:27:59,340
a degree of

6536
04:27:59,340 --> 04:28:01,920
this is how far you're allowed to go

6537
04:28:01,920 --> 04:28:03,899
but then the Wicks are permitted to do a

6538
04:28:03,899 --> 04:28:05,640
certain measure of of damage which is

6539
04:28:05,640 --> 04:28:08,779
what we're seeing right here

6540
04:28:08,819 --> 04:28:11,279
the halfway point of that range nobody's

6541
04:28:11,279 --> 04:28:12,960
going to look at this stuff here okay

6542
04:28:12,960 --> 04:28:14,880
and Define it like that

6543
04:28:14,880 --> 04:28:17,819
it isn't anywhere else okay

6544
04:28:17,819 --> 04:28:20,760
I I codified this so I want you to

6545
04:28:20,760 --> 04:28:22,800
understand that

6546
04:28:22,800 --> 04:28:25,439
these candlesticks are supporting the

6547
04:28:25,439 --> 04:28:27,000
idea of the principle I'm teaching to

6548
04:28:27,000 --> 04:28:30,540
you it's not limited to just this

6549
04:28:30,540 --> 04:28:32,220
it's happening every time I tell you

6550
04:28:32,220 --> 04:28:34,560
there's a balanced price range this is

6551
04:28:34,560 --> 04:28:36,600
the this is what's occurring the

6552
04:28:36,600 --> 04:28:39,120
Market's returning back to equilibrium

6553
04:28:39,120 --> 04:28:41,279
that's what this is here okay it's not

6554
04:28:41,279 --> 04:28:42,899
consequent encroachment it's not mean

6555
04:28:42,899 --> 04:28:45,300
threshold it's equilibrium a balanced

6556
04:28:45,300 --> 04:28:47,040
price range is going to go back to

6557
04:28:47,040 --> 04:28:49,080
equilibrium

6558
04:28:49,080 --> 04:28:51,420
the bodies in here are supporting that

6559
04:28:51,420 --> 04:28:53,760
as long as we don't get any close lower

6560
04:28:53,760 --> 04:28:55,439
there is no manual intervention if it

6561
04:28:55,439 --> 04:28:56,880
does there's manual intervention and you

6562
04:28:56,880 --> 04:28:58,620
abort it

6563
04:28:58,620 --> 04:29:00,479
this is just supporting the idea that

6564
04:29:00,479 --> 04:29:02,580
it's going to go higher so what you want

6565
04:29:02,580 --> 04:29:03,899
to see is you want to see the market one

6566
04:29:03,899 --> 04:29:04,739
two

6567
04:29:04,739 --> 04:29:08,359
move to the up move up and then create

6568
04:29:08,359 --> 04:29:11,520
more power three power three is

6569
04:29:11,520 --> 04:29:16,199
open down close rally close on the high

6570
04:29:16,199 --> 04:29:20,279
open drop rally close on the high

6571
04:29:20,279 --> 04:29:23,580
do we see it here drop small rally up

6572
04:29:23,580 --> 04:29:24,479
close

6573
04:29:24,479 --> 04:29:27,960
open drop down rally come back still

6574
04:29:27,960 --> 04:29:29,040
enough close

6575
04:29:29,040 --> 04:29:31,140
so much of a small little movement you

6576
04:29:31,140 --> 04:29:32,939
can barely see it but it up close we

6577
04:29:32,939 --> 04:29:36,060
open we drop down rally up close what is

6578
04:29:36,060 --> 04:29:38,279
order flow

6579
04:29:38,279 --> 04:29:40,680
what is the order flow at that time

6580
04:29:40,680 --> 04:29:43,080
is it bullish or is it bearish

6581
04:29:43,080 --> 04:29:44,880
bullish

6582
04:29:44,880 --> 04:29:47,460
at this time right here

6583
04:29:47,460 --> 04:29:49,739
right here okay on this candle's close

6584
04:29:49,739 --> 04:29:51,779
on the very next candle on a 15 minute

6585
04:29:51,779 --> 04:29:54,420
basis you can use power three on that

6586
04:29:54,420 --> 04:29:57,060
one fifty minute candle right there

6587
04:29:57,060 --> 04:29:59,520
as it opens it drops down

6588
04:29:59,520 --> 04:30:02,399
you can be buying anywhere in the upper

6589
04:30:02,399 --> 04:30:05,760
50 of this candle here and expect this

6590
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:09,319
range here to stay open why

6591
04:30:10,800 --> 04:30:15,080
why would this be expected to stay open

6592
04:30:16,739 --> 04:30:20,000
you see this candle right here

6593
04:30:20,399 --> 04:30:23,100
this is the same thing occurring here

6594
04:30:23,100 --> 04:30:25,859
with more candles in between this is all

6595
04:30:25,859 --> 04:30:28,140
time distortion

6596
04:30:28,140 --> 04:30:30,300
I know this is too complicated this

6597
04:30:30,300 --> 04:30:32,760
give me a moving average I know I know

6598
04:30:32,760 --> 04:30:34,020
some of you were getting frustrated

6599
04:30:34,020 --> 04:30:36,239
because but you want to learn and I'm

6600
04:30:36,239 --> 04:30:38,340
willing to teach it to you but you don't

6601
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:40,800
need everything but I'm teaching you how

6602
04:30:40,800 --> 04:30:42,540
I do these things how do I determine

6603
04:30:42,540 --> 04:30:44,760
when I'm doing live executions I say

6604
04:30:44,760 --> 04:30:46,439
this is going to stay open it's optimal

6605
04:30:46,439 --> 04:30:48,060
for this fair value you have to stay

6606
04:30:48,060 --> 04:30:50,460
open you're asking me to teach you so

6607
04:30:50,460 --> 04:30:53,040
I'm teaching you the same element of

6608
04:30:53,040 --> 04:30:55,260
delivery here and here

6609
04:30:55,260 --> 04:30:56,939
that one single candle right here

6610
04:30:56,939 --> 04:30:59,640
imagine this one candle if all these

6611
04:30:59,640 --> 04:31:01,620
candles from this candle here

6612
04:31:01,620 --> 04:31:03,420
to here we're compressed into one

6613
04:31:03,420 --> 04:31:05,220
interval it would be the same thing

6614
04:31:05,220 --> 04:31:08,699
happening right there just more candles

6615
04:31:08,699 --> 04:31:11,100
that's all it's happening so my eyes go

6616
04:31:11,100 --> 04:31:13,080
into this

6617
04:31:13,080 --> 04:31:15,060
to this so now let's use the same

6618
04:31:15,060 --> 04:31:17,279
criteria okay

6619
04:31:17,279 --> 04:31:21,479
Which is higher this low

6620
04:31:21,479 --> 04:31:24,060
or this love

6621
04:31:24,060 --> 04:31:26,840
This Love

6622
04:31:28,620 --> 04:31:30,420
so there's your we don't want to Anchor

6623
04:31:30,420 --> 04:31:32,699
to that okay

6624
04:31:32,699 --> 04:31:35,600
draw that down

6625
04:31:35,819 --> 04:31:38,100
come on

6626
04:31:38,100 --> 04:31:40,920
I use a it's not a mouse it's a

6627
04:31:40,920 --> 04:31:44,220
touch pad thing which is lower the high

6628
04:31:44,220 --> 04:31:46,319
of this candle

6629
04:31:46,319 --> 04:31:48,779
or the high of this candle

6630
04:31:48,779 --> 04:31:52,100
let me take this off you can see

6631
04:31:52,439 --> 04:31:53,880
the dog

6632
04:31:53,880 --> 04:31:55,380
this high

6633
04:31:55,380 --> 04:31:57,000
or this high

6634
04:31:57,000 --> 04:31:58,800
Which is higher this one

6635
04:31:58,800 --> 04:32:00,659
for this one

6636
04:32:00,659 --> 04:32:04,199
this one so this high in this

6637
04:32:04,199 --> 04:32:06,540
I'm sorry this low and this high is the

6638
04:32:06,540 --> 04:32:08,819
two reference points

6639
04:32:08,819 --> 04:32:10,920
but you want to expand it down you want

6640
04:32:10,920 --> 04:32:12,659
a full encapsulation like we did over

6641
04:32:12,659 --> 04:32:15,600
here for a balanced price range so this

6642
04:32:15,600 --> 04:32:17,880
is a lower FVG than this one

6643
04:32:17,880 --> 04:32:19,680
to what degree what measures the

6644
04:32:19,680 --> 04:32:21,600
distinction between this being lower

6645
04:32:21,600 --> 04:32:24,960
than that one it's this

6646
04:32:24,960 --> 04:32:27,680
candle here

6647
04:32:27,840 --> 04:32:31,100
in other words think of it like this

6648
04:32:31,800 --> 04:32:33,300
I know what I want to say I just can't

6649
04:32:33,300 --> 04:32:34,979
find the words to

6650
04:32:34,979 --> 04:32:38,300
they're escaping me

6651
04:32:39,000 --> 04:32:40,199
all right if we were looking at both

6652
04:32:40,199 --> 04:32:42,300
fear by gas like this

6653
04:32:42,300 --> 04:32:43,920
which one's higher

6654
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:45,180
this one right

6655
04:32:45,180 --> 04:32:48,359
so to identify and map this out we use

6656
04:32:48,359 --> 04:32:49,800
this one

6657
04:32:49,800 --> 04:32:54,979
as the high and we drag it down to here

6658
04:32:56,520 --> 04:32:59,760
okay so all of this

6659
04:32:59,760 --> 04:33:02,159
is a balanced price range

6660
04:33:02,159 --> 04:33:03,899
it should never

6661
04:33:03,899 --> 04:33:07,199
it should never come back down and

6662
04:33:07,199 --> 04:33:09,180
through the midpoint of that meaning

6663
04:33:09,180 --> 04:33:11,160
there would be a small portion of this

6664
04:33:11,160 --> 04:33:13,320
Gap left open so let's play Devil's out

6665
04:33:13,320 --> 04:33:14,641
again for a moment say it went down into

6666
04:33:14,641 --> 04:33:16,980
this range I would not be concerned

6667
04:33:16,980 --> 04:33:19,141
about it doing a complete closure here

6668
04:33:19,141 --> 04:33:22,740
because we have this sphere value Gap In

6669
04:33:22,740 --> 04:33:24,660
this River you got that basically

6670
04:33:24,660 --> 04:33:27,320
overlap

6671
04:33:27,419 --> 04:33:29,759
in this range right there

6672
04:33:29,759 --> 04:33:31,859
so we have this portion here and over

6673
04:33:31,859 --> 04:33:35,039
here so this creates what

6674
04:33:35,039 --> 04:33:37,859
an island reversal

6675
04:33:37,859 --> 04:33:40,320
multiple candles that are segregated

6676
04:33:40,320 --> 04:33:44,219
from all the movement here and here

6677
04:33:44,219 --> 04:33:47,099
so how I internalize it is all of this

6678
04:33:47,099 --> 04:33:48,180
right here

6679
04:33:48,180 --> 04:33:51,599
was manipulation just like all of this

6680
04:33:51,599 --> 04:33:53,699
is manipulation

6681
04:33:53,699 --> 04:33:57,118
so the purpose was is to offset existing

6682
04:33:57,118 --> 04:33:58,680
liquidity

6683
04:33:58,680 --> 04:34:01,219
for the purposes of anyone that would be

6684
04:34:01,219 --> 04:34:04,500
profitable once we get above this high

6685
04:34:04,500 --> 04:34:07,199
it's all spending time down there to

6686
04:34:07,199 --> 04:34:11,340
allow offset longs to be taken out and

6687
04:34:11,340 --> 04:34:13,080
who would assume that position if

6688
04:34:13,080 --> 04:34:15,141
they're getting knocked out smart money

6689
04:34:15,141 --> 04:34:18,359
the market rallies

6690
04:34:18,359 --> 04:34:21,840
it admittedly balanced price ranges are

6691
04:34:21,840 --> 04:34:24,359
going to be requiring a lot of Education

6692
04:34:24,359 --> 04:34:26,580
a lot of teaching okay and I promise you

6693
04:34:26,580 --> 04:34:28,199
that

6694
04:34:28,199 --> 04:34:31,320
you don't need it but you asked me to

6695
04:34:31,320 --> 04:34:33,359
tell you how I know

6696
04:34:33,359 --> 04:34:35,520
certain FVG are going to

6697
04:34:35,520 --> 04:34:38,278
stay open and I'm not I'm not hiding it

6698
04:34:38,278 --> 04:34:40,680
from you I'm telling you these this is

6699
04:34:40,680 --> 04:34:42,359
it this is what I'm doing to do that

6700
04:34:42,359 --> 04:34:45,660
okay they're all principles and Concepts

6701
04:34:45,660 --> 04:34:47,219
that I'm using to implement to determine

6702
04:34:47,219 --> 04:34:48,958
when FVG are going to stay

6703
04:34:48,958 --> 04:34:51,061
up and I know I'm talking to you right

6704
04:34:51,061 --> 04:34:53,039
now over this chart it's after the fact

6705
04:34:53,039 --> 04:34:56,039
but I don't know how many of the

6706
04:34:56,039 --> 04:34:57,719
examples you've watched me trade where

6707
04:34:57,719 --> 04:34:59,458
I'm doing live examples I'm entering and

6708
04:34:59,458 --> 04:35:01,080
I'm managing the Stop and I'm taking

6709
04:35:01,080 --> 04:35:03,240
partials and hitting targets I don't

6710
04:35:03,240 --> 04:35:04,438
know how many of those examples I've

6711
04:35:04,438 --> 04:35:08,160
shown restore that you've seen but they

6712
04:35:08,160 --> 04:35:09,778
predominantly have been shared on

6713
04:35:09,778 --> 04:35:11,458
Twitter because I usually put music

6714
04:35:11,458 --> 04:35:13,199
behind them because you know I like to

6715
04:35:13,199 --> 04:35:14,938
do that but

6716
04:35:14,938 --> 04:35:16,919
I still show them on my YouTube channel

6717
04:35:16,919 --> 04:35:18,480
too but most of the time they're being

6718
04:35:18,480 --> 04:35:20,641
shared on Twitter because it allows you

6719
04:35:20,641 --> 04:35:23,160
to see a very small two-minute sometimes

6720
04:35:23,160 --> 04:35:25,080
less than two minutes and 20 seconds

6721
04:35:25,080 --> 04:35:28,320
compression of me executing

6722
04:35:28,320 --> 04:35:30,299
and every annotation I'm talking about

6723
04:35:30,299 --> 04:35:32,520
and showing if I'm talking about how a

6724
04:35:32,520 --> 04:35:35,278
fair value should be it would be optimal

6725
04:35:35,278 --> 04:35:37,259
for it to stay open and not close

6726
04:35:37,259 --> 04:35:40,080
I'm using that either as a breakaway Gap

6727
04:35:40,080 --> 04:35:43,020
these are the two primary functions okay

6728
04:35:43,020 --> 04:35:44,820
either I'm treating it as a breakaway

6729
04:35:44,820 --> 04:35:47,278
Gap and it should not close fully

6730
04:35:47,278 --> 04:35:50,938
meaning like this Gap here let me let me

6731
04:35:50,938 --> 04:35:53,358
draw it in

6732
04:35:54,719 --> 04:35:56,820
the charge Edition today

6733
04:35:56,820 --> 04:35:59,219
it's too good for the books

6734
04:35:59,219 --> 04:36:01,199
this Gap here

6735
04:36:01,199 --> 04:36:03,958
it should stay open

6736
04:36:03,958 --> 04:36:06,480
to be optimal that means it's the best

6737
04:36:06,480 --> 04:36:09,299
case scenario to see this stay open I

6738
04:36:09,299 --> 04:36:11,099
would say that about this one regardless

6739
04:36:11,099 --> 04:36:12,419
because it would be treated as a

6740
04:36:12,419 --> 04:36:15,480
breakaway Gap why because this over here

6741
04:36:15,480 --> 04:36:17,160
is a balanced price range and it's in

6742
04:36:17,160 --> 04:36:19,500
equilibrium and the body's supporting

6743
04:36:19,500 --> 04:36:21,958
that idea is seen here

6744
04:36:21,958 --> 04:36:23,520
then we see price moving here and then

6745
04:36:23,520 --> 04:36:25,379
we have this big extrapolation but yet

6746
04:36:25,379 --> 04:36:27,000
to take out this high

6747
04:36:27,000 --> 04:36:28,799
so this is the draw this is where price

6748
04:36:28,799 --> 04:36:29,820
would want to reach up to because

6749
04:36:29,820 --> 04:36:31,438
there's real liquidity above it what

6750
04:36:31,438 --> 04:36:33,840
kind of liquidity by side

6751
04:36:33,840 --> 04:36:37,980
this Gap is moving quickly away from all

6752
04:36:37,980 --> 04:36:40,080
this consolidation around equilibrium

6753
04:36:40,080 --> 04:36:42,419
based on that balanced price range

6754
04:36:42,419 --> 04:36:44,039
and I know some of your heads are

6755
04:36:44,039 --> 04:36:45,958
swirling right now like what the hell is

6756
04:36:45,958 --> 04:36:47,039
he talking about

6757
04:36:47,039 --> 04:36:49,500
example after example spend time with me

6758
04:36:49,500 --> 04:36:50,820
every time there's a balanced price

6759
04:36:50,820 --> 04:36:52,379
range I will bring your attention to it

6760
04:36:52,379 --> 04:36:55,561
okay I do it in live executions I talk

6761
04:36:55,561 --> 04:36:57,778
about it in advance I talk about it in

6762
04:36:57,778 --> 04:37:00,061
tweets I talk about it in reviews okay

6763
04:37:00,061 --> 04:37:02,520
the more time you see it

6764
04:37:02,520 --> 04:37:05,039
the more exposure you'll have to it but

6765
04:37:05,039 --> 04:37:07,259
for a breakaway Gap and some of you

6766
04:37:07,259 --> 04:37:08,759
thought I'd never get to this topic huh

6767
04:37:08,759 --> 04:37:13,020
a breakaway Gap is expected to form when

6768
04:37:13,020 --> 04:37:15,419
for instance say we're bullish on the

6769
04:37:15,419 --> 04:37:16,080
market

6770
04:37:16,080 --> 04:37:18,480
and you have identified a key level that

6771
04:37:18,480 --> 04:37:19,641
would support us

6772
04:37:19,641 --> 04:37:23,520
or be presented as support and that

6773
04:37:23,520 --> 04:37:26,039
is acting as a discount array

6774
04:37:26,039 --> 04:37:28,141
balanced price range at equilibrium

6775
04:37:28,141 --> 04:37:31,320
that's one of the PD arrays that is not

6776
04:37:31,320 --> 04:37:33,958
taught in the mentorship core content

6777
04:37:33,958 --> 04:37:36,299
where I show you the pdra Matrix and I

6778
04:37:36,299 --> 04:37:39,359
give you a spectrum of where they are

6779
04:37:39,359 --> 04:37:42,299
a balanced price range can exist in any

6780
04:37:42,299 --> 04:37:45,299
place in a discount or a premium so

6781
04:37:45,299 --> 04:37:47,219
there's no real definitive place where

6782
04:37:47,219 --> 04:37:48,900
they work in an hierarchy whereas the

6783
04:37:48,900 --> 04:37:50,759
hierarchy I show you in The pdre Matrix

6784
04:37:50,759 --> 04:37:53,520
the ones that are there that is a static

6785
04:37:53,520 --> 04:37:56,879
that is very finite they they nest in

6786
04:37:56,879 --> 04:37:59,160
that order but there are other PD arrays

6787
04:37:59,160 --> 04:38:00,900
like this one I'm showing you here and

6788
04:38:00,900 --> 04:38:04,259
like Event Horizon those things can

6789
04:38:04,259 --> 04:38:06,900
exist in any range of that Spectrum

6790
04:38:06,900 --> 04:38:09,000
which we Define as a discount or a

6791
04:38:09,000 --> 04:38:11,458
premium Okay so

6792
04:38:11,458 --> 04:38:13,141
and if you're brand new that just

6793
04:38:13,141 --> 04:38:14,400
completely win over your head but I

6794
04:38:14,400 --> 04:38:17,340
promise you dig into the the content and

6795
04:38:17,340 --> 04:38:18,419
it's there

6796
04:38:18,419 --> 04:38:19,859
don't try to think you're going to learn

6797
04:38:19,859 --> 04:38:22,199
how to do all this stuff right away and

6798
04:38:22,199 --> 04:38:24,299
you don't need to know everything you

6799
04:38:24,299 --> 04:38:26,039
don't need to know a FVG that

6800
04:38:26,039 --> 04:38:27,900
stays open you don't need that to be

6801
04:38:27,900 --> 04:38:30,000
profitable but I'm making it available

6802
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:31,980
to folks that want to know everything

6803
04:38:31,980 --> 04:38:33,599
that I'm willing to share

6804
04:38:33,599 --> 04:38:35,458
so you asked I'm teaching you how to do

6805
04:38:35,458 --> 04:38:37,618
it so even if this didn't have this Gap

6806
04:38:37,618 --> 04:38:38,879
over here that creates a balanced price

6807
04:38:38,879 --> 04:38:42,439
range between these two favorite gaps

6808
04:38:42,539 --> 04:38:44,458
the fact that

6809
04:38:44,458 --> 04:38:46,740
it does this move here and creates the

6810
04:38:46,740 --> 04:38:49,080
Fairway Gap notice there is no Gap here

6811
04:38:49,080 --> 04:38:52,438
all through here until this candle forms

6812
04:38:52,438 --> 04:38:55,320
no Gap is there

6813
04:38:55,320 --> 04:38:57,061
everything is efficiently delivered

6814
04:38:57,061 --> 04:39:00,180
every previous high is touched every

6815
04:39:00,180 --> 04:39:02,099
previous high is touched

6816
04:39:02,099 --> 04:39:03,958
this one goes outside the range of it

6817
04:39:03,958 --> 04:39:05,400
and even goes deeper but then you have

6818
04:39:05,400 --> 04:39:08,039
this big extrapolation of The Upside

6819
04:39:08,039 --> 04:39:10,320
so this Gap here

6820
04:39:10,320 --> 04:39:12,419
even if this wasn't here as a fair value

6821
04:39:12,419 --> 04:39:15,000
got this Gap

6822
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:18,080
that's shaded here

6823
04:39:18,778 --> 04:39:20,641
I'm being conscious of whether or not

6824
04:39:20,641 --> 04:39:21,958
this live stream is keeping up with

6825
04:39:21,958 --> 04:39:23,580
because I noticed the one on the 13th

6826
04:39:23,580 --> 04:39:25,020
when I was moving my cursor around what

6827
04:39:25,020 --> 04:39:26,879
I was talking about wasn't showing on my

6828
04:39:26,879 --> 04:39:29,340
cursor so I'm hoping that's not the case

6829
04:39:29,340 --> 04:39:32,039
here but the one that's shaded let's put

6830
04:39:32,039 --> 04:39:35,938
it that way I would treat that

6831
04:39:35,938 --> 04:39:38,400
regardless of the gap on the other side

6832
04:39:38,400 --> 04:39:39,780
here

6833
04:39:39,780 --> 04:39:42,180
whether that's there or not this is

6834
04:39:42,180 --> 04:39:45,120
classified to me as a breakaway cap

6835
04:39:45,120 --> 04:39:47,520
meaning that a breakaway Gap I don't

6836
04:39:47,520 --> 04:39:49,798
want to see it completely close in

6837
04:39:49,798 --> 04:39:52,440
it can come back down to half of it but

6838
04:39:52,440 --> 04:39:53,820
because there's a balanced price range

6839
04:39:53,820 --> 04:39:56,280
here I wouldn't want to see even half of

6840
04:39:56,280 --> 04:39:58,080
it traded to so then you would see me

6841
04:39:58,080 --> 04:40:00,600
say I want to see this trade

6842
04:40:00,600 --> 04:40:03,840
I'm sorry remain open it would be

6843
04:40:03,840 --> 04:40:05,760
optimal for this to remain open

6844
04:40:05,760 --> 04:40:08,640
but the very next candle here the same

6845
04:40:08,640 --> 04:40:10,860
thing you would expect it to do what you

6846
04:40:10,860 --> 04:40:12,000
can see it open

6847
04:40:12,000 --> 04:40:14,340
and then the previous candles High over

6848
04:40:14,340 --> 04:40:16,320
here overlapping this one that would be

6849
04:40:16,320 --> 04:40:18,060
otherwise a FVG if this would

6850
04:40:18,060 --> 04:40:20,400
make the low as low as it did here this

6851
04:40:20,400 --> 04:40:22,860
low completely returns back to debt the

6852
04:40:22,860 --> 04:40:24,120
candle's High

6853
04:40:24,120 --> 04:40:26,940
so any movement from here down into that

6854
04:40:26,940 --> 04:40:29,820
you could be a long entry or if you're

6855
04:40:29,820 --> 04:40:32,400
already long you can pyramid

6856
04:40:32,400 --> 04:40:35,100
so when you see me showing you a one

6857
04:40:35,100 --> 04:40:37,440
minute chart or a three minute chart

6858
04:40:37,440 --> 04:40:39,180
whatever time frame I'm utilizing I'm

6859
04:40:39,180 --> 04:40:40,140
showing you

6860
04:40:40,140 --> 04:40:42,660
I'm not trying to hide anything from you

6861
04:40:42,660 --> 04:40:44,878
but I've been very open and candid about

6862
04:40:44,878 --> 04:40:47,400
that I'm looking at other time frames

6863
04:40:47,400 --> 04:40:50,218
so this is a 15 minute Candlestick chart

6864
04:40:50,218 --> 04:40:52,320
if you were watching all this movement

6865
04:40:52,320 --> 04:40:54,120
from the open of this candle down to the

6866
04:40:54,120 --> 04:40:56,280
low of it and then we're watching it on

6867
04:40:56,280 --> 04:40:57,660
a one minute chart

6868
04:40:57,660 --> 04:41:01,140
it would be not so clear probably to

6869
04:41:01,140 --> 04:41:04,080
what it is it would be the factor for me

6870
04:41:04,080 --> 04:41:05,940
to trust that that drop down where some

6871
04:41:05,940 --> 04:41:07,260
of you might be freaking out thinking

6872
04:41:07,260 --> 04:41:09,718
you know it's hitting this area or this

6873
04:41:09,718 --> 04:41:12,120
area in that resistance or whatever

6874
04:41:12,120 --> 04:41:12,840
um

6875
04:41:12,840 --> 04:41:16,080
I don't I don't feel those problems or

6876
04:41:16,080 --> 04:41:17,940
fear because I'm trusting that the order

6877
04:41:17,940 --> 04:41:19,378
flow

6878
04:41:19,378 --> 04:41:22,200
is being supported by every candlestick

6879
04:41:22,200 --> 04:41:24,480
that's real order flow

6880
04:41:24,480 --> 04:41:26,638
all the candles are supporting each

6881
04:41:26,638 --> 04:41:27,958
other

6882
04:41:27,958 --> 04:41:30,240
there's no trend line required there's

6883
04:41:30,240 --> 04:41:32,400
no moving average required there's no

6884
04:41:32,400 --> 04:41:35,280
v-wop required nothing it's pure price

6885
04:41:35,280 --> 04:41:37,500
just pure price

6886
04:41:37,500 --> 04:41:39,540
and then we get one down closed candle

6887
04:41:39,540 --> 04:41:41,160
that happens after the high is taken out

6888
04:41:41,160 --> 04:41:42,000
here

6889
04:41:42,000 --> 04:41:44,520
where is it trade back down into

6890
04:41:44,520 --> 04:41:46,740
relative equal highs

6891
04:41:46,740 --> 04:41:49,200
all this overlapping in between this

6892
04:41:49,200 --> 04:41:50,638
area here

6893
04:41:50,638 --> 04:41:53,520
that is creating a very strong

6894
04:41:53,520 --> 04:41:56,160
balance price range in and itself all of

6895
04:41:56,160 --> 04:41:58,378
this movement in here is back and forth

6896
04:41:58,378 --> 04:42:01,080
back and forth so it's showing that it's

6897
04:42:01,080 --> 04:42:02,940
not willing to go below fifteen thousand

6898
04:42:02,940 --> 04:42:04,440
two sixteen

6899
04:42:04,440 --> 04:42:06,840
so was it what is it more likely to

6900
04:42:06,840 --> 04:42:08,218
explore

6901
04:42:08,218 --> 04:42:10,080
BS that's existing where would

6902
04:42:10,080 --> 04:42:11,280
that be

6903
04:42:11,280 --> 04:42:15,120
above here and keep pressing higher

6904
04:42:15,120 --> 04:42:17,340
so it's a matter of reading a lot of

6905
04:42:17,340 --> 04:42:20,218
things that if you're if you're really

6906
04:42:20,218 --> 04:42:22,560
not interested in becoming you know

6907
04:42:22,560 --> 04:42:25,080
versed in what it is I teach this is

6908
04:42:25,080 --> 04:42:27,120
where we depart where you're like okay

6909
04:42:27,120 --> 04:42:28,860
this is too much I'm not interested okay

6910
04:42:28,860 --> 04:42:30,958
it's just too much this can try this new

6911
04:42:30,958 --> 04:42:33,240
conjecture it's hindsight it's that but

6912
04:42:33,240 --> 04:42:34,500
I'm telling you everything that I'm

6913
04:42:34,500 --> 04:42:36,060
doing when i'm doing the executions and

6914
04:42:36,060 --> 04:42:37,378
the things I'm leaning on when I give

6915
04:42:37,378 --> 04:42:40,200
you the analysis like I did on the 13th

6916
04:42:40,200 --> 04:42:42,660
you know it's based on all these things

6917
04:42:42,660 --> 04:42:44,218
at the time when I'm looking at the

6918
04:42:44,218 --> 04:42:46,740
chart am I watching a a five second

6919
04:42:46,740 --> 04:42:49,080
chart a 15 second chart you know 30

6920
04:42:49,080 --> 04:42:51,120
second chart a five minute business a

6921
04:42:51,120 --> 04:42:53,940
five minute chart or an hourly chart all

6922
04:42:53,940 --> 04:42:56,218
these things I'm looking at

6923
04:42:56,218 --> 04:42:58,378
notice the things the same things that

6924
04:42:58,378 --> 04:43:00,480
I'm looking at are continuous

6925
04:43:00,480 --> 04:43:02,700
discount or premium

6926
04:43:02,700 --> 04:43:05,520
inefficiency or liquidity

6927
04:43:05,520 --> 04:43:08,100
the only the only separation from those

6928
04:43:08,100 --> 04:43:11,040
things for analysis purposes is the

6929
04:43:11,040 --> 04:43:12,660
relationship to the balance price range

6930
04:43:12,660 --> 04:43:17,100
or the lack of a balanced price range

6931
04:43:17,100 --> 04:43:19,320
did you pick that up

6932
04:43:19,320 --> 04:43:22,798
there there's there's no necessity for

6933
04:43:22,798 --> 04:43:24,360
you to understand the balance price

6934
04:43:24,360 --> 04:43:27,240
range just know that you will see things

6935
04:43:27,240 --> 04:43:28,620
that will

6936
04:43:28,620 --> 04:43:31,320
not present an opportunity for you

6937
04:43:31,320 --> 04:43:34,760
because you don't understand it

6938
04:43:35,100 --> 04:43:38,040
notice that you would not need this to

6939
04:43:38,040 --> 04:43:39,360
take any trades

6940
04:43:39,360 --> 04:43:42,298
it just gives you more clarity about how

6941
04:43:42,298 --> 04:43:44,700
to read PA and know where you

6942
04:43:44,700 --> 04:43:46,798
are in that PD Continuum

6943
04:43:46,798 --> 04:43:49,680
where are we at in relationship to where

6944
04:43:49,680 --> 04:43:52,020
price has been and where is it heading

6945
04:43:52,020 --> 04:43:54,900
what reference points is it using for a

6946
04:43:54,900 --> 04:43:56,700
new point of

6947
04:43:56,700 --> 04:43:59,458
buying where you can then break that

6948
04:43:59,458 --> 04:44:02,400
down in in the smaller fractals which is

6949
04:44:02,400 --> 04:44:03,600
what I've shown you here with each

6950
04:44:03,600 --> 04:44:06,298
individual candle power three

6951
04:44:06,298 --> 04:44:09,600
is essentially the the open if you're

6952
04:44:09,600 --> 04:44:12,420
bullish it's an open down move that you

6953
04:44:12,420 --> 04:44:14,458
want to go along in and that's the part

6954
04:44:14,458 --> 04:44:16,440
that Larry Williams was saying he didn't

6955
04:44:16,440 --> 04:44:18,180
understand how to do that and he made a

6956
04:44:18,180 --> 04:44:20,280
facetious comment saying that I don't

6957
04:44:20,280 --> 04:44:21,958
know maybe if you knew their

6958
04:44:21,958 --> 04:44:23,700
their zip code it will help which was

6959
04:44:23,700 --> 04:44:25,440
silly obviously but

6960
04:44:25,440 --> 04:44:26,520
um

6961
04:44:26,520 --> 04:44:28,620
it to me was like a personal challenge

6962
04:44:28,620 --> 04:44:30,840
like well if he can't do that I'm

6963
04:44:30,840 --> 04:44:32,760
going to spend my time trying to figure

6964
04:44:32,760 --> 04:44:35,580
that out so that's that's where I got

6965
04:44:35,580 --> 04:44:37,860
the idea of you know stripping down the

6966
04:44:37,860 --> 04:44:39,718
market and looking for discounted

6967
04:44:39,718 --> 04:44:40,798
premium

6968
04:44:40,798 --> 04:44:42,840
the opening price when it's bullish I

6969
04:44:42,840 --> 04:44:44,400
want to be looking at the open or less

6970
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:46,200
the buy whereas at the time when I was

6971
04:44:46,200 --> 04:44:48,420
learning from his material he was

6972
04:44:48,420 --> 04:44:50,660
teaching and trading with real money

6973
04:44:50,660 --> 04:44:54,060
buying on strength so he would he would

6974
04:44:54,060 --> 04:44:55,320
buy

6975
04:44:55,320 --> 04:44:57,900
some measure of the previous day's range

6976
04:44:57,900 --> 04:45:00,600
usually 20 of the previous danger range

6977
04:45:00,600 --> 04:45:03,718
added to tomorrow's opening and if it

6978
04:45:03,718 --> 04:45:05,580
moved like that he would buy that and

6979
04:45:05,580 --> 04:45:07,860
consider that buying strength I tried

6980
04:45:07,860 --> 04:45:09,900
that and got my ass handed to me um I

6981
04:45:09,900 --> 04:45:11,700
just I could never make that work for

6982
04:45:11,700 --> 04:45:14,280
myself I'm not saying that

6983
04:45:14,280 --> 04:45:16,320
it doesn't work or that he didn't make

6984
04:45:16,320 --> 04:45:18,240
money with it because he clearly did

6985
04:45:18,240 --> 04:45:20,520
I couldn't make that work so I

6986
04:45:20,520 --> 04:45:21,900
understand when I teach a specific

6987
04:45:21,900 --> 04:45:23,100
concept and it might be the balanced

6988
04:45:23,100 --> 04:45:23,940
price range that you're probably looking

6989
04:45:23,940 --> 04:45:25,740
at this is too complicated

6990
04:45:25,740 --> 04:45:28,138
don't worry about it stick to the things

6991
04:45:28,138 --> 04:45:29,340
that make sense

6992
04:45:29,340 --> 04:45:32,458
I did the same thing I I had a love and

6993
04:45:32,458 --> 04:45:34,740
an adoration for Mr Williams when I was

6994
04:45:34,740 --> 04:45:35,878
learning all this stuff I've trusted

6995
04:45:35,878 --> 04:45:38,100
them with everything okay I was

6996
04:45:38,100 --> 04:45:39,540
literally throwing money in Brokers

6997
04:45:39,540 --> 04:45:41,940
accounts just to test a new thing I

6998
04:45:41,940 --> 04:45:45,298
learned that day okay so it was I

6999
04:45:45,298 --> 04:45:47,400
understand but it's like the the Fanfare

7000
04:45:47,400 --> 04:45:48,600
that comes around somebody that you have

7001
04:45:48,600 --> 04:45:51,360
a lot of affinity for but don't do that

7002
04:45:51,360 --> 04:45:53,760
with my Concepts you know and really

7003
04:45:53,760 --> 04:45:55,260
spend time with measuring what it is

7004
04:45:55,260 --> 04:45:56,580
that makes sense to you that you've done

7005
04:45:56,580 --> 04:45:58,378
the due diligence and back testing and

7006
04:45:58,378 --> 04:46:00,660
seeing what one of these PD arrays that

7007
04:46:00,660 --> 04:46:03,180
makes sense to you and the obvious ones

7008
04:46:03,180 --> 04:46:05,820
the easiest ones that you see that's the

7009
04:46:05,820 --> 04:46:07,798
one you spend the most time with and

7010
04:46:07,798 --> 04:46:09,480
you're most of you are going to

7011
04:46:09,480 --> 04:46:12,180
determine your model is linked to that

7012
04:46:12,180 --> 04:46:14,458
In Bloom where you're planted don't try

7013
04:46:14,458 --> 04:46:16,920
to Tinker with it too much all you're

7014
04:46:16,920 --> 04:46:18,360
trying to do is find something that

7015
04:46:18,360 --> 04:46:19,740
separates from where the market is right

7016
04:46:19,740 --> 04:46:21,840
now where it's likely to go and measure

7017
04:46:21,840 --> 04:46:23,820
risk that you can afford to take as a

7018
04:46:23,820 --> 04:46:26,100
loss and then you repeat that over and

7019
04:46:26,100 --> 04:46:27,660
over again and that's profitability

7020
04:46:27,660 --> 04:46:29,520
that's consistency that's continuity

7021
04:46:29,520 --> 04:46:32,160
which brings longevity you don't want to

7022
04:46:32,160 --> 04:46:34,138
be a one-hit wonder get a five figure

7023
04:46:34,138 --> 04:46:35,638
withdrawal from a funded account say

7024
04:46:35,638 --> 04:46:38,340
hell yeah I'm balling here that's not

7025
04:46:38,340 --> 04:46:39,840
that's not success

7026
04:46:39,840 --> 04:46:41,280
that's what everybody's treating it like

7027
04:46:41,280 --> 04:46:43,138
right now they want to get funded and

7028
04:46:43,138 --> 04:46:45,958
get a lottery win okay I'm not teaching

7029
04:46:45,958 --> 04:46:47,820
you how to be a lottery Trader I'm

7030
04:46:47,820 --> 04:46:49,580
teaching you how to be a long-term

7031
04:46:49,580 --> 04:46:52,378
consistently profitable Trader but that

7032
04:46:52,378 --> 04:46:53,820
doesn't happen overnight some of you

7033
04:46:53,820 --> 04:46:55,500
think you can make it happen like that

7034
04:46:55,500 --> 04:46:57,660
it doesn't work like that it doesn't

7035
04:46:57,660 --> 04:46:59,458
because you're going to bring in all

7036
04:46:59,458 --> 04:47:00,780
kinds of things that you have to wrestle

7037
04:47:00,780 --> 04:47:02,218
with then you're gonna you're gonna

7038
04:47:02,218 --> 04:47:03,840
swear up and down that you know

7039
04:47:03,840 --> 04:47:06,060
something I'm gonna teach or talk

7040
04:47:06,060 --> 04:47:08,400
or will teach is the replacement for

7041
04:47:08,400 --> 04:47:09,958
what you think is the the best thing for

7042
04:47:09,958 --> 04:47:11,400
you every time I bring something new

7043
04:47:11,400 --> 04:47:13,080
you're going to question the thing that

7044
04:47:13,080 --> 04:47:14,520
may be showing you evidence that this is

7045
04:47:14,520 --> 04:47:16,320
your model right now

7046
04:47:16,320 --> 04:47:18,900
don't let me sway you

7047
04:47:18,900 --> 04:47:20,700
with something new

7048
04:47:20,700 --> 04:47:22,860
it'll always be on the YouTube channel

7049
04:47:22,860 --> 04:47:24,360
whatever I'm teaching is going to stay

7050
04:47:24,360 --> 04:47:26,820
up but wherever you start seeing success

7051
04:47:26,820 --> 04:47:29,638
even in the early stages don't abandon

7052
04:47:29,638 --> 04:47:32,280
that you have to give yourself time and

7053
04:47:32,280 --> 04:47:33,600
you have to stick with something long

7054
04:47:33,600 --> 04:47:35,638
enough to know that you have a

7055
04:47:35,638 --> 04:47:36,900
foundation in it and you're going to see

7056
04:47:36,900 --> 04:47:39,360
that all these PD arrays lean and lean

7057
04:47:39,360 --> 04:47:41,458
on one another it's like a web

7058
04:47:41,458 --> 04:47:44,160
that all it's a whole entire structure

7059
04:47:44,160 --> 04:47:46,138
when I look at Price I'm seeing all of

7060
04:47:46,138 --> 04:47:48,000
it at one time

7061
04:47:48,000 --> 04:47:49,620
some of the things I want to see I have

7062
04:47:49,620 --> 04:47:50,760
to wait to see if they're going to

7063
04:47:50,760 --> 04:47:52,980
manifest and that's usually on the heel

7064
04:47:52,980 --> 04:47:55,080
end or backside of a high impact or

7065
04:47:55,080 --> 04:47:58,458
medium impact news driver

7066
04:48:00,780 --> 04:48:03,480
all right so

7067
04:48:03,480 --> 04:48:06,740
let's go into a five minute chart

7068
04:48:09,560 --> 04:48:11,940
excuse me

7069
04:48:11,940 --> 04:48:14,100
all right so we have

7070
04:48:14,100 --> 04:48:16,980
all the balance price range equilibrium

7071
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:19,320
we have the Breakaway Gap we traded

7072
04:48:19,320 --> 04:48:21,298
above we have a down closed candle so

7073
04:48:21,298 --> 04:48:22,500
what is this

7074
04:48:22,500 --> 04:48:25,020
what's this down close candle

7075
04:48:25,020 --> 04:48:27,420
bull shoulder block does it have a fair

7076
04:48:27,420 --> 04:48:30,020
value Gap

7077
04:48:30,540 --> 04:48:31,740
right there

7078
04:48:31,740 --> 04:48:34,878
what time of day is that

7079
04:48:35,040 --> 04:48:37,138
1005 what time is that

7080
04:48:37,138 --> 04:48:39,360
that's your am session Silver-Bullet to

7081
04:48:39,360 --> 04:48:43,080
ICT Silver-Bullet you can trade this

7082
04:48:43,080 --> 04:48:46,760
Gap right here which would be

7083
04:48:46,980 --> 04:48:49,560
encapsulated here what time do you start

7084
04:48:49,560 --> 04:48:51,360
looking for and

7085
04:48:51,360 --> 04:48:54,000
an ICT Silver-Bullet trade

7086
04:48:54,000 --> 04:48:56,040
if you're trading in the one hour

7087
04:48:56,040 --> 04:48:59,520
spectrum of 10 a.m to 11 A.M you start

7088
04:48:59,520 --> 04:49:02,760
with your 15 minute down to five four

7089
04:49:02,760 --> 04:49:05,820
three two one if you don't see it in the

7090
04:49:05,820 --> 04:49:07,920
one minute or higher

7091
04:49:07,920 --> 04:49:09,780
drop down into the seconds charts if

7092
04:49:09,780 --> 04:49:11,458
you're adamant about finding one it will

7093
04:49:11,458 --> 04:49:13,920
be there it will absolutely be there let

7094
04:49:13,920 --> 04:49:15,600
me

7095
04:49:15,600 --> 04:49:19,138
let me tell you why okay here's the why

7096
04:49:19,138 --> 04:49:22,260
behind a solar bullet okay

7097
04:49:22,260 --> 04:49:24,660
there is always folks just like a

7098
04:49:24,660 --> 04:49:27,000
partial profit pays every time

7099
04:49:27,000 --> 04:49:28,378
it's a hundred percent profitable when

7100
04:49:28,378 --> 04:49:30,840
you take a partial profit it never fails

7101
04:49:30,840 --> 04:49:32,940
to pay you that's why I teach you to do

7102
04:49:32,940 --> 04:49:35,100
it you're always winning taking a

7103
04:49:35,100 --> 04:49:39,298
partial it never ever ever fails to put

7104
04:49:39,298 --> 04:49:41,340
more money in your account think about

7105
04:49:41,340 --> 04:49:43,440
that and there's dumbasses out there

7106
04:49:43,440 --> 04:49:45,540
that'll tell you taking partials is the

7107
04:49:45,540 --> 04:49:47,040
stupid they've ever heard because

7108
04:49:47,040 --> 04:49:49,440
you incur the initial risk and you take

7109
04:49:49,440 --> 04:49:50,760
less than you tried to make when you

7110
04:49:50,760 --> 04:49:52,320
first put the trade on you don't

7111
04:49:52,320 --> 04:49:53,760
know if that Market's gonna go there

7112
04:49:53,760 --> 04:49:54,718
Yahoo

7113
04:49:54,718 --> 04:49:57,180
and you as a new developing student you

7114
04:49:57,180 --> 04:49:59,040
have no idea is going to do that either

7115
04:49:59,040 --> 04:50:00,540
so when it gives you the opportunity to

7116
04:50:00,540 --> 04:50:04,080
take money out you do it any over time

7117
04:50:04,080 --> 04:50:05,760
doing that you learn more about yourself

7118
04:50:05,760 --> 04:50:08,760
you learn more to trust okay I've seen

7119
04:50:08,760 --> 04:50:11,340
this before let me let me expand outside

7120
04:50:11,340 --> 04:50:13,620
my comfort zone this is where I normally

7121
04:50:13,620 --> 04:50:15,660
take the majority of my trade-off let me

7122
04:50:15,660 --> 04:50:17,820
just take a small portion and move

7123
04:50:17,820 --> 04:50:20,280
myself to break even and graduate in my

7124
04:50:20,280 --> 04:50:21,780
experience and seeing what it feels like

7125
04:50:21,780 --> 04:50:24,298
to go into these scary moments but still

7126
04:50:24,298 --> 04:50:27,480
taking profits nobody no Buck

7127
04:50:27,480 --> 04:50:30,298
Rogers jumped out there and said I know

7128
04:50:30,298 --> 04:50:31,798
how to trade this is the model I'm going

7129
04:50:31,798 --> 04:50:34,860
to do and it's full bore full pool no

7130
04:50:34,860 --> 04:50:36,298
partials and I'm doing it all the time

7131
04:50:36,298 --> 04:50:39,060
that's an okay that's an

7132
04:50:39,060 --> 04:50:40,620
that tells you that and it's an

7133
04:50:40,620 --> 04:50:42,020
that's telling you to trade like that

7134
04:50:42,020 --> 04:50:44,878
you don't know when these markets are

7135
04:50:44,878 --> 04:50:46,080
going to have manual intervention you

7136
04:50:46,080 --> 04:50:47,458
have no idea when it's going to turn on

7137
04:50:47,458 --> 04:50:50,878
you nobody does that if I didn't if I

7138
04:50:50,878 --> 04:50:52,500
didn't

7139
04:50:52,500 --> 04:50:55,080
have the respect of the risk that's

7140
04:50:55,080 --> 04:50:57,060
available in these markets I wouldn't

7141
04:50:57,060 --> 04:50:59,458
use a stop loss

7142
04:50:59,458 --> 04:51:01,798
and I'm the guy teaching you I'm telling

7143
04:51:01,798 --> 04:51:03,600
you I get pissed off when I see students

7144
04:51:03,600 --> 04:51:05,340
sending me their screenshots of their

7145
04:51:05,340 --> 04:51:07,020
trades that are open the first thing I'm

7146
04:51:07,020 --> 04:51:08,760
looking for is where their stop loss is

7147
04:51:08,760 --> 04:51:10,680
and I usually bite my tongue because I

7148
04:51:10,680 --> 04:51:12,480
don't want to embarrass them but if

7149
04:51:12,480 --> 04:51:13,680
you're sending me tweets and you're

7150
04:51:13,680 --> 04:51:15,360
sending me your open profit trades

7151
04:51:15,360 --> 04:51:17,400
whether it be live or demo or funded

7152
04:51:17,400 --> 04:51:19,260
account if you don't have a stop loss on

7153
04:51:19,260 --> 04:51:21,718
here just know that I'm cringing

7154
04:51:21,718 --> 04:51:25,200
I'm cringing because you're not using a

7155
04:51:25,200 --> 04:51:27,240
stop loss that means you're

7156
04:51:27,240 --> 04:51:30,360
gambling you you assume that you're

7157
04:51:30,360 --> 04:51:31,620
absolutely right there's no way you can

7158
04:51:31,620 --> 04:51:35,100
be wrong and I don't even think that

7159
04:51:35,100 --> 04:51:36,660
I authored all this and I still

7160
04:51:36,660 --> 04:51:38,760
have to use a stop loss

7161
04:51:38,760 --> 04:51:42,120
because you don't know when chaos is

7162
04:51:42,120 --> 04:51:43,320
going to show up

7163
04:51:43,320 --> 04:51:45,480
you don't know when uncertainty enters

7164
04:51:45,480 --> 04:51:47,760
the chat

7165
04:51:47,760 --> 04:51:50,580
some unexpected event some bomb drops

7166
04:51:50,580 --> 04:51:52,920
somewhere someone declares w-a-r-u

7167
04:51:52,920 --> 04:51:55,440
paying attention

7168
04:51:55,440 --> 04:51:57,540
so

7169
04:51:57,540 --> 04:52:01,500
why do Silver-Bullets work

7170
04:52:01,500 --> 04:52:03,958
why will they form because there's

7171
04:52:03,958 --> 04:52:07,500
always going to be displacement

7172
04:52:07,500 --> 04:52:10,560
between 10 o'clock and 11 why

7173
04:52:10,560 --> 04:52:11,878
this is the part where you take notes

7174
04:52:11,878 --> 04:52:14,298
folks okay

7175
04:52:14,340 --> 04:52:18,298
in the hour of 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock

7176
04:52:18,298 --> 04:52:20,638
in the morning New York local time

7177
04:52:20,638 --> 04:52:22,620
what has happened already

7178
04:52:22,620 --> 04:52:24,718
The Market opens at 9 30. they're

7179
04:52:24,718 --> 04:52:26,458
opening bell I mean we've been trading

7180
04:52:26,458 --> 04:52:28,378
all night long but the opening bell

7181
04:52:28,378 --> 04:52:29,458
happens

7182
04:52:29,458 --> 04:52:31,200
ding ding ding everybody's now paying

7183
04:52:31,200 --> 04:52:32,520
attention everybody's clapping their

7184
04:52:32,520 --> 04:52:33,718
hands I've never understood what the

7185
04:52:33,718 --> 04:52:35,218
 they're clapping for but the bottom

7186
04:52:35,218 --> 04:52:37,440
line is is that the Market's open

7187
04:52:37,440 --> 04:52:40,378
9 30 bills of ring now everybody's

7188
04:52:40,378 --> 04:52:43,560
rushing out there to buy and sell stocks

7189
04:52:43,560 --> 04:52:44,878
great

7190
04:52:44,878 --> 04:52:47,940
retail trader John Q public is watching

7191
04:52:47,940 --> 04:52:50,340
the ticker tape and he's saying okay my

7192
04:52:50,340 --> 04:52:52,138
stock opened up

7193
04:52:52,138 --> 04:52:54,060
two dollars more where it closed

7194
04:52:54,060 --> 04:52:56,340
yesterday this is amazing

7195
04:52:56,340 --> 04:52:58,378
I'm making money well that Gap is going

7196
04:52:58,378 --> 04:53:00,780
to close likely and then it drops down

7197
04:53:00,780 --> 04:53:03,420
then after that Gap fills if it fills at

7198
04:53:03,420 --> 04:53:05,458
all then there's new sentiment that

7199
04:53:05,458 --> 04:53:08,820
shifts okay it either overlaps that Gap

7200
04:53:08,820 --> 04:53:10,560
and breaks down then it treats the low

7201
04:53:10,560 --> 04:53:12,298
of the Gap as resistance and keeps going

7202
04:53:12,298 --> 04:53:13,560
lower or

7203
04:53:13,560 --> 04:53:15,958
it fills the Gap rallies up treats the

7204
04:53:15,958 --> 04:53:17,280
higher the Gap is support and then

7205
04:53:17,280 --> 04:53:19,378
continuously moves higher there's your

7206
04:53:19,378 --> 04:53:20,940
Gap Theory right there

7207
04:53:20,940 --> 04:53:23,400
use that with new week opening Gap new

7208
04:53:23,400 --> 04:53:25,798
day opening Gap any Gap any fair value

7209
04:53:25,798 --> 04:53:28,138
Gap any real liquidity void that's how

7210
04:53:28,138 --> 04:53:29,700
you treat it

7211
04:53:29,700 --> 04:53:31,138
now

7212
04:53:31,138 --> 04:53:33,660
what separates the support behind that

7213
04:53:33,660 --> 04:53:35,520
Gap is the consequent culture in the

7214
04:53:35,520 --> 04:53:38,280
midpoint how we trade there

7215
04:53:38,280 --> 04:53:41,480
at time of day

7216
04:53:42,360 --> 04:53:44,760
at 10 o'clock we have 30 minutes behind

7217
04:53:44,760 --> 04:53:45,718
us

7218
04:53:45,718 --> 04:53:47,520
which is why I tell you the 30 minute

7219
04:53:47,520 --> 04:53:50,840
opening range that's important

7220
04:53:50,840 --> 04:53:54,600
every every algorithm

7221
04:53:54,600 --> 04:53:58,040
uses that first 30 minutes

7222
04:53:58,260 --> 04:54:00,298
every one of them

7223
04:54:00,298 --> 04:54:03,780
they use that to refine a very specific

7224
04:54:03,780 --> 04:54:06,980
range to look for inefficiencies and

7225
04:54:06,980 --> 04:54:10,020
allow sometimes liquidity to form below

7226
04:54:10,020 --> 04:54:12,718
or above it and they'll do another path

7227
04:54:12,718 --> 04:54:14,820
go back below take stops out and then

7228
04:54:14,820 --> 04:54:16,500
run through

7229
04:54:16,500 --> 04:54:20,280
or don't return back into it at all

7230
04:54:20,280 --> 04:54:22,798
but just half of it

7231
04:54:22,798 --> 04:54:25,378
and then it runs higher or lower in

7232
04:54:25,378 --> 04:54:27,360
deference to whatever the bias would be

7233
04:54:27,360 --> 04:54:28,860
for that day

7234
04:54:28,860 --> 04:54:31,440
but the main takeaway is at 10 o'clock

7235
04:54:31,440 --> 04:54:33,600
you have 30 minutes of trading after the

7236
04:54:33,600 --> 04:54:35,458
opening bell so that initial flurry of

7237
04:54:35,458 --> 04:54:37,260
rush to do something

7238
04:54:37,260 --> 04:54:39,420
John Q public is doing their trading

7239
04:54:39,420 --> 04:54:43,138
then and they're usually apt to be wrong

7240
04:54:43,138 --> 04:54:46,200
so we allow for that to take place we

7241
04:54:46,200 --> 04:54:48,000
don't have any bias ahead of time okay

7242
04:54:48,000 --> 04:54:49,620
we don't care

7243
04:54:49,620 --> 04:54:53,700
and we wait and see where price delivers

7244
04:54:53,700 --> 04:54:56,458
from 9 30 to 10 o'clock

7245
04:54:56,458 --> 04:54:58,138
now at 10 o'clock

7246
04:54:58,138 --> 04:55:00,360
we refer to where we think price is

7247
04:55:00,360 --> 04:55:02,040
going to go anyway

7248
04:55:02,040 --> 04:55:04,440
where we've been calling price for

7249
04:55:04,440 --> 04:55:06,980
NASDAQ

7250
04:55:07,860 --> 04:55:09,120
I'm going to use the continuous

7251
04:55:09,120 --> 04:55:10,680
contractors to get a HTF

7252
04:55:10,680 --> 04:55:13,100
perspective

7253
04:55:14,400 --> 04:55:16,378
okay

7254
04:55:16,378 --> 04:55:19,580
BS liquidity here

7255
04:55:20,290 --> 04:55:22,500
[Music]

7256
04:55:22,500 --> 04:55:26,420
there and we have a order block

7257
04:55:27,900 --> 04:55:30,958
there why this one Michael

7258
04:55:30,958 --> 04:55:32,760
this one stretches down it's relatively

7259
04:55:32,760 --> 04:55:35,400
equal lows also I'm using that as a

7260
04:55:35,400 --> 04:55:38,100
reference point you wouldn't be wrong by

7261
04:55:38,100 --> 04:55:40,320
saying this one

7262
04:55:40,320 --> 04:55:41,760
okay I'm just using it because it's

7263
04:55:41,760 --> 04:55:43,620
lower so it's a lower hanging fruit

7264
04:55:43,620 --> 04:55:45,240
objective it doesn't mean it's going to

7265
04:55:45,240 --> 04:55:46,740
go there it just means that that's how I

7266
04:55:46,740 --> 04:55:49,638
would look at it like that

7267
04:55:50,878 --> 04:55:53,940
so if we have this

7268
04:55:53,940 --> 04:55:56,100
by side liquidity here as a potential

7269
04:55:56,100 --> 04:55:57,780
drawing liquidity

7270
04:55:57,780 --> 04:56:00,000
and then drop down into that with Tony

7271
04:56:00,000 --> 04:56:02,660
Green we're on

7272
04:56:04,440 --> 04:56:06,780
was it 15 minutes right

7273
04:56:06,780 --> 04:56:08,240
yes

7274
04:56:08,240 --> 04:56:12,440
we have this as a buy solid liquidity

7275
04:56:13,138 --> 04:56:15,660
and go back into what we're looking for

7276
04:56:15,660 --> 04:56:17,820
higher prices nonetheless

7277
04:56:17,820 --> 04:56:20,458
lower dollar

7278
04:56:20,458 --> 04:56:22,440
risk on

7279
04:56:22,440 --> 04:56:25,560
your dot higher pound dollar higher

7280
04:56:25,560 --> 04:56:27,600
and equities are permitted to trade

7281
04:56:27,600 --> 04:56:29,400
higher

7282
04:56:29,400 --> 04:56:31,980
our Focus was on ES

7283
04:56:31,980 --> 04:56:33,180
that's the one I've been teaching

7284
04:56:33,180 --> 04:56:35,520
through there was an on

7285
04:56:35,520 --> 04:56:37,020
filled or re

7286
04:56:37,020 --> 04:56:39,718
traded to

7287
04:56:39,718 --> 04:56:41,760
weekly imbalance of volume and balance

7288
04:56:41,760 --> 04:56:45,060
on the e-mini s p

7289
04:56:45,060 --> 04:56:47,878
NASDAQ has been the upside performer so

7290
04:56:47,878 --> 04:56:51,540
even though NASDAQ has already moved up

7291
04:56:51,540 --> 04:56:54,360
you could take trades in the ES

7292
04:56:54,360 --> 04:56:55,920
but if you're trying to take a trade

7293
04:56:55,920 --> 04:56:57,180
like if you want to use relative

7294
04:56:57,180 --> 04:56:58,680
strength analysis and you want to do

7295
04:56:58,680 --> 04:57:00,540
longs

7296
04:57:00,540 --> 04:57:01,980
the one you want to be trading is the

7297
04:57:01,980 --> 04:57:03,298
one that's showing the outperformance on

7298
04:57:03,298 --> 04:57:05,340
the upside which has been clearly the

7299
04:57:05,340 --> 04:57:08,160
leader in Tech so NASDAQ is in the

7300
04:57:08,160 --> 04:57:09,718
upside leader

7301
04:57:09,718 --> 04:57:13,378
BS will follow in suit by sympathy okay

7302
04:57:13,378 --> 04:57:15,298
so it's a sympathetic price rally it's

7303
04:57:15,298 --> 04:57:17,580
it's moving in concert with what has

7304
04:57:17,580 --> 04:57:20,280
been shown in NASDAQ and it has to catch

7305
04:57:20,280 --> 04:57:22,740
up to what es I'm sorry what NASDAQ has

7306
04:57:22,740 --> 04:57:23,940
done

7307
04:57:23,940 --> 04:57:25,740
for the purposes of making it clear I'm

7308
04:57:25,740 --> 04:57:27,600
going to use the

7309
04:57:27,600 --> 04:57:29,520
June contract because you'll remember

7310
04:57:29,520 --> 04:57:32,958
these inefficiencies

7311
04:57:34,200 --> 04:57:36,480
okay so here's the NASDAQ remember I

7312
04:57:36,480 --> 04:57:38,280
told you there's the inefficiency we've

7313
04:57:38,280 --> 04:57:40,320
already worked inside that one

7314
04:57:40,320 --> 04:57:43,320
if we look at it from the perspective of

7315
04:57:43,320 --> 04:57:46,280
the ES

7316
04:57:47,340 --> 04:57:49,020
we only went to this high and we have

7317
04:57:49,020 --> 04:57:51,420
yet to trade up into this inefficiency

7318
04:57:51,420 --> 04:57:53,458
so in my opinion you know we have much

7319
04:57:53,458 --> 04:57:55,500
more room to go up on the outside

7320
04:57:55,500 --> 04:57:57,540
now if you take that insight and you add

7321
04:57:57,540 --> 04:57:59,458
it to the new front month

7322
04:57:59,458 --> 04:58:03,000
based on the volume we have this

7323
04:58:03,000 --> 04:58:05,480
here

7324
04:58:06,060 --> 04:58:08,160
okay so that's the this is the month

7325
04:58:08,160 --> 04:58:10,260
that we're trading in for ES and then we

7326
04:58:10,260 --> 04:58:13,520
add it to NQ again

7327
04:58:15,480 --> 04:58:17,160
we can't pull that out because of the

7328
04:58:17,160 --> 04:58:19,378
the data is not being there so I'm

7329
04:58:19,378 --> 04:58:21,600
referring that to

7330
04:58:21,600 --> 04:58:24,900
the previous month that will be expiring

7331
04:58:24,900 --> 04:58:26,580
knowing that we're likely to continue

7332
04:58:26,580 --> 04:58:29,218
but I fall away from the analysis from

7333
04:58:29,218 --> 04:58:32,218
NASDAQ and we're like more so on the es

7334
04:58:32,218 --> 04:58:34,378
because es should move sympathetically

7335
04:58:34,378 --> 04:58:37,080
higher to try to catch up

7336
04:58:37,080 --> 04:58:39,298
that's the theory of Six Sisters Six

7337
04:58:39,298 --> 04:58:42,120
Sisters we have the leadership in NASDAQ

7338
04:58:42,120 --> 04:58:46,680
but in es es will try to move in concert

7339
04:58:46,680 --> 04:58:50,700
with so we may see in the future a a

7340
04:58:50,700 --> 04:58:53,218
consolidation or a lack of leadership on

7341
04:58:53,218 --> 04:58:55,860
NASDAQ and then

7342
04:58:55,860 --> 04:58:59,160
more upside offered on a bigger day move

7343
04:58:59,160 --> 04:59:00,840
on like ES

7344
04:59:00,840 --> 04:59:02,820
it might not happen but that's how I

7345
04:59:02,820 --> 04:59:05,820
treat the six sister so as long as the

7346
04:59:05,820 --> 04:59:07,920
leadership issue goes higher which is

7347
04:59:07,920 --> 04:59:10,560
NASDAQ that should pull up looking for

7348
04:59:10,560 --> 04:59:12,000
instance all boats rise in high tide

7349
04:59:12,000 --> 04:59:14,160
that's the that's the moniker I'm using

7350
04:59:14,160 --> 04:59:16,560
here this everything goes up when the

7351
04:59:16,560 --> 04:59:19,020
tie goes up so

7352
04:59:19,020 --> 04:59:21,240
but if you contrast that with with the

7353
04:59:21,240 --> 04:59:23,940
the Dow

7354
04:59:23,940 --> 04:59:25,020
is doing

7355
04:59:25,020 --> 04:59:27,420
this thing's lethargic it just doesn't

7356
04:59:27,420 --> 04:59:29,820
want to join the party at all

7357
04:59:29,820 --> 04:59:33,680
but we were able to see it in a while

7358
04:59:34,138 --> 04:59:35,700
our Run Tour

7359
04:59:35,700 --> 04:59:38,280
High here

7360
04:59:38,280 --> 04:59:40,860
on NASDAQ

7361
04:59:40,860 --> 04:59:43,980
I told you I was waiting for CPI on the

7362
04:59:43,980 --> 04:59:46,920
June 13th live stream

7363
04:59:46,920 --> 04:59:49,080
um I was aware that the CPI number could

7364
04:59:49,080 --> 04:59:52,560
potentially cause a big dive lower for

7365
04:59:52,560 --> 04:59:53,940
the person to SS but it would

7366
04:59:53,940 --> 04:59:56,040
just be the purpose of taking out stops

7367
04:59:56,040 --> 04:59:57,420
and then resume that was the whole

7368
04:59:57,420 --> 04:59:58,860
premise when I talked about NASDAQ you

7369
04:59:58,860 --> 05:00:00,120
can go and watch live stream that's

7370
05:00:00,120 --> 05:00:02,878
there in the commentary and it was a

7371
05:00:02,878 --> 05:00:04,980
similar idea with es it was probably

7372
05:00:04,980 --> 05:00:07,138
wait and see the only thing I was

7373
05:00:07,138 --> 05:00:09,480
definitive on on stock indices at the

7374
05:00:09,480 --> 05:00:11,580
time of that live stream at the 18

7375
05:00:11,580 --> 05:00:13,740
minute and 49 second time period I

7376
05:00:13,740 --> 05:00:16,200
pulled up this chart here and I said

7377
05:00:16,200 --> 05:00:19,320
that 39 628 would be the Drone liquidity

7378
05:00:19,320 --> 05:00:21,240
which is in the first High

7379
05:00:21,240 --> 05:00:23,700
and that's where we saw it draw up into

7380
05:00:23,700 --> 05:00:25,680
and it stopped pretty much right after

7381
05:00:25,680 --> 05:00:26,940
that

7382
05:00:26,940 --> 05:00:29,100
retrace lower

7383
05:00:29,100 --> 05:00:31,560
and now we're piercing it again

7384
05:00:31,560 --> 05:00:32,218
um

7385
05:00:32,218 --> 05:00:35,100
I don't trade the Dow I use it as a

7386
05:00:35,100 --> 05:00:37,680
barometer like I use the dollar Index so

7387
05:00:37,680 --> 05:00:39,420
I'm looking at the relationships between

7388
05:00:39,420 --> 05:00:42,840
the three averages so if this is

7389
05:00:42,840 --> 05:00:45,180
typically you understood as Dow Theory

7390
05:00:45,180 --> 05:00:46,740
which I think in

7391
05:00:46,740 --> 05:00:49,320
obviously using stock indices it works

7392
05:00:49,320 --> 05:00:52,138
it's a proven method and it's comparing

7393
05:00:52,138 --> 05:00:53,520
the averages they should confirm one

7394
05:00:53,520 --> 05:00:55,320
another and I'll show you what I mean by

7395
05:00:55,320 --> 05:01:00,860
that let's pull up the es chart

7396
05:01:01,320 --> 05:01:04,200
and we'll pull it up on a so this is

7397
05:01:04,200 --> 05:01:05,100
what I'm thinking we're going to reach

7398
05:01:05,100 --> 05:01:06,958
up to so that way we know if in case I

7399
05:01:06,958 --> 05:01:09,360
lose track of what I'm saying I think es

7400
05:01:09,360 --> 05:01:11,638
is going to pull up into 4500 or just

7401
05:01:11,638 --> 05:01:13,620
below it so there you go you have an

7402
05:01:13,620 --> 05:01:15,360
expectation of what I think

7403
05:01:15,360 --> 05:01:17,580
we're reaching for I know someone's

7404
05:01:17,580 --> 05:01:19,200
reached out and told me that Larry

7405
05:01:19,200 --> 05:01:21,420
Williams is calling for you know

7406
05:01:21,420 --> 05:01:23,160
retracement or moving lower I don't see

7407
05:01:23,160 --> 05:01:24,360
that happening until we get up to here

7408
05:01:24,360 --> 05:01:25,980
for at least yes

7409
05:01:25,980 --> 05:01:27,840
and I'm happy to be wrong to you know

7410
05:01:27,840 --> 05:01:30,298
against his analysis but you know I'm

7411
05:01:30,298 --> 05:01:33,378
sharing what what I think

7412
05:01:33,958 --> 05:01:36,540
all right here's a 60 Minute chart and I

7413
05:01:36,540 --> 05:01:38,400
still want a 15 minute chart I failed to

7414
05:01:38,400 --> 05:01:40,560
mention earlier a 15-minute chart is a

7415
05:01:40,560 --> 05:01:42,420
Bellwether chart

7416
05:01:42,420 --> 05:01:46,020
like it's to me like if I was forced to

7417
05:01:46,020 --> 05:01:48,718
do anything less than a

7418
05:01:48,718 --> 05:01:50,580
a daily chart

7419
05:01:50,580 --> 05:01:52,920
and I couldn't do anything below a daily

7420
05:01:52,920 --> 05:01:54,480
chart

7421
05:01:54,480 --> 05:01:57,060
and just use one time frame it would be

7422
05:01:57,060 --> 05:01:58,920
the 15 minute chart

7423
05:01:58,920 --> 05:02:02,160
like it gives you the best of the best

7424
05:02:02,160 --> 05:02:03,780
in terms of short-term entries and

7425
05:02:03,780 --> 05:02:06,360
targets because everything you can find

7426
05:02:06,360 --> 05:02:08,340
on The Daily you'll see it on this if

7427
05:02:08,340 --> 05:02:10,620
you compress enough you'll you'll have

7428
05:02:10,620 --> 05:02:12,540
better refinement of those level levels

7429
05:02:12,540 --> 05:02:14,218
too you can get short-term trades you

7430
05:02:14,218 --> 05:02:16,200
can day trade you can scalp you can

7431
05:02:16,200 --> 05:02:17,878
enter into long-term position trades

7432
05:02:17,878 --> 05:02:20,040
it's the the

7433
05:02:20,040 --> 05:02:23,458
it's the time frame it does all

7434
05:02:23,458 --> 05:02:26,400
I'm not limited or satisfied with that

7435
05:02:26,400 --> 05:02:28,138
because that's why like I go into lower

7436
05:02:28,138 --> 05:02:29,638
LTFs even sub one minute

7437
05:02:29,638 --> 05:02:31,798
like in the seconds charts I don't

7438
05:02:31,798 --> 05:02:33,718
advise the new people to do that because

7439
05:02:33,718 --> 05:02:35,580
you can read into

7440
05:02:35,580 --> 05:02:38,100
15 and 5 and 10 and 30 second charts

7441
05:02:38,100 --> 05:02:40,260
thinking you see something there that on

7442
05:02:40,260 --> 05:02:42,240
an hourly chart

7443
05:02:42,240 --> 05:02:44,638
is like Rocket Fuel and boom you know

7444
05:02:44,638 --> 05:02:46,320
these things can move like 40 handles on

7445
05:02:46,320 --> 05:02:47,760
something on a HTF basis

7446
05:02:47,760 --> 05:02:49,320
on a news driver and you're thinking

7447
05:02:49,320 --> 05:02:51,120
you're seeing a FVG on a 30

7448
05:02:51,120 --> 05:02:53,280
second 15 second you chart and get

7449
05:02:53,280 --> 05:02:54,480
roasted

7450
05:02:54,480 --> 05:02:56,280
all right so anyway

7451
05:02:56,280 --> 05:02:59,520
yes here on a 15 minute basis

7452
05:02:59,520 --> 05:03:01,020
you click on this little thing up here

7453
05:03:01,020 --> 05:03:03,060
for com compare

7454
05:03:03,060 --> 05:03:05,700
and you're going to type in or find it

7455
05:03:05,700 --> 05:03:07,020
in here but I'm going to show you how to

7456
05:03:07,020 --> 05:03:08,218
do because assuming you don't have it on

7457
05:03:08,218 --> 05:03:09,240
your chart yeah

7458
05:03:09,240 --> 05:03:12,900
NQ u2023

7459
05:03:16,980 --> 05:03:18,840
if you do it like that it's going to

7460
05:03:18,840 --> 05:03:21,360
plot it right over top of your chart I

7461
05:03:21,360 --> 05:03:24,060
don't like that okay what I do is I go

7462
05:03:24,060 --> 05:03:26,280
over here and I set it to and I know

7463
05:03:26,280 --> 05:03:27,298
some of you are going to say well if you

7464
05:03:27,298 --> 05:03:31,440
do this you do I know I know

7465
05:03:31,440 --> 05:03:32,760
foreign

7466
05:03:32,760 --> 05:03:35,760
candlesticks

7467
05:03:42,000 --> 05:03:44,580
you can do it on a line basis

7468
05:03:44,580 --> 05:03:45,540
but I'm going to show you the

7469
05:03:45,540 --> 05:03:48,740
Candlestick version okay

7470
05:04:01,378 --> 05:04:04,340
yeah I did it wrong

7471
05:04:07,280 --> 05:04:10,620
I have it set up as a template I've been

7472
05:04:10,620 --> 05:04:12,298
spoiling myself with it

7473
05:04:12,298 --> 05:04:13,680
you can create little templates over

7474
05:04:13,680 --> 05:04:15,180
here

7475
05:04:15,180 --> 05:04:18,120
and we'll set this on new pane

7476
05:04:18,120 --> 05:04:21,060
new pane puts it down below the price

7477
05:04:21,060 --> 05:04:23,400
and you want to do it with a dow also

7478
05:04:23,400 --> 05:04:27,320
and I don't see the Dow here so

7479
05:04:48,000 --> 05:04:49,920
now if you're going to use it as a as a

7480
05:04:49,920 --> 05:04:50,940
line chart

7481
05:04:50,940 --> 05:04:53,580
since we're looking at lows okay this is

7482
05:04:53,580 --> 05:04:55,200
how you back test you study it and get

7483
05:04:55,200 --> 05:04:57,660
your screenshots of it if we're bullish

7484
05:04:57,660 --> 05:04:58,980
and you're expecting it to see a

7485
05:04:58,980 --> 05:05:01,620
rotation higher in some Divergence which

7486
05:05:01,620 --> 05:05:04,878
would be smt diversion

7487
05:05:07,260 --> 05:05:09,900
you're plotting on the low

7488
05:05:09,900 --> 05:05:12,540
so you're comparing the relationship of

7489
05:05:12,540 --> 05:05:14,878
the low of es or whatever when you're

7490
05:05:14,878 --> 05:05:16,798
using this will be my trading instrument

7491
05:05:16,798 --> 05:05:19,320
and then for Nasdaq I'm plotting this

7492
05:05:19,320 --> 05:05:23,100
line chart on the basis of the close

7493
05:05:23,100 --> 05:05:25,740
I'm sorry on the low rather and same

7494
05:05:25,740 --> 05:05:28,340
thing with the

7495
05:05:28,500 --> 05:05:29,760
the down

7496
05:05:29,760 --> 05:05:32,580
you're going to do it on the well

7497
05:05:32,580 --> 05:05:36,080
and then squeeze it up a little bit

7498
05:05:38,580 --> 05:05:41,280
and you want to compare the low do we

7499
05:05:41,280 --> 05:05:43,500
see a lower low here on the NASDAQ we do

7500
05:05:43,500 --> 05:05:45,958
and it looks like we see a lower low on

7501
05:05:45,958 --> 05:05:47,940
the Dow so there's no smt diversions

7502
05:05:47,940 --> 05:05:50,240
there

7503
05:05:57,360 --> 05:05:59,580
same thing here

7504
05:05:59,580 --> 05:06:02,400
lower low respectively

7505
05:06:02,400 --> 05:06:05,760
lower low respectively so if we see a

7506
05:06:05,760 --> 05:06:09,020
time when there's a

7507
05:06:09,718 --> 05:06:11,280
lower low in your trading instrument

7508
05:06:11,280 --> 05:06:13,740
whether say you're trading es or you're

7509
05:06:13,740 --> 05:06:15,420
trading NASDAQ

7510
05:06:15,420 --> 05:06:17,280
when you compare the other averages

7511
05:06:17,280 --> 05:06:20,040
against it if you're long or wanting to

7512
05:06:20,040 --> 05:06:22,620
go long you want to plot this and if it

7513
05:06:22,620 --> 05:06:26,458
gives you a Divergence it acts as

7514
05:06:26,458 --> 05:06:29,520
a qualifier I can you can take and you

7515
05:06:29,520 --> 05:06:32,400
will take trades without smt but when

7516
05:06:32,400 --> 05:06:34,798
smt forms or Divergence against the

7517
05:06:34,798 --> 05:06:36,298
averages or if you're using it against

7518
05:06:36,298 --> 05:06:37,620
the

7519
05:06:37,620 --> 05:06:40,920
the dollar against the Euro or the pound

7520
05:06:40,920 --> 05:06:43,980
versus the URL which is a correlated

7521
05:06:43,980 --> 05:06:45,600
pair smt that versions when you're

7522
05:06:45,600 --> 05:06:47,458
looking at two closely correlated which

7523
05:06:47,458 --> 05:06:48,900
is essentially what we're doing here

7524
05:06:48,900 --> 05:06:51,360
it's this is a

7525
05:06:51,360 --> 05:06:52,560
uh

7526
05:06:52,560 --> 05:06:56,160
correlated pair smt but with index

7527
05:06:56,160 --> 05:06:58,798
features if they were considered payers

7528
05:06:58,798 --> 05:07:00,958
of correlated pair smt the versions

7529
05:07:00,958 --> 05:07:03,060
would be euro dollar

7530
05:07:03,060 --> 05:07:05,400
making a lower low while pound dollar

7531
05:07:05,400 --> 05:07:08,520
makes a higher low when Dollar is

7532
05:07:08,520 --> 05:07:10,320
bearish

7533
05:07:10,320 --> 05:07:13,860
that would mean dollar goes lower and

7534
05:07:13,860 --> 05:07:16,138
the one that makes the failed lower low

7535
05:07:16,138 --> 05:07:18,240
that's the relative strength leader that

7536
05:07:18,240 --> 05:07:19,680
was the one you would be going long in

7537
05:07:19,680 --> 05:07:22,138
in either Euro or pound whichever one

7538
05:07:22,138 --> 05:07:24,840
makes the the failed lower level

7539
05:07:24,840 --> 05:07:27,480
so there's a lot of measuring that goes

7540
05:07:27,480 --> 05:07:29,580
on when I'm watching PAs

7541
05:07:29,580 --> 05:07:31,500
if you

7542
05:07:31,500 --> 05:07:33,480
heard me many times mention I have a lot

7543
05:07:33,480 --> 05:07:36,420
of monitors okay you don't need a lot of

7544
05:07:36,420 --> 05:07:38,218
monitors but you need to be able to have

7545
05:07:38,218 --> 05:07:41,100
at least two charts open that could be

7546
05:07:41,100 --> 05:07:42,540
done on the laptop like I was showing

7547
05:07:42,540 --> 05:07:45,000
you here earlier or it could be a

7548
05:07:45,000 --> 05:07:46,740
secondary monitor you know in your

7549
05:07:46,740 --> 05:07:47,760
system

7550
05:07:47,760 --> 05:07:50,878
it's very very difficult to trade

7551
05:07:50,878 --> 05:07:52,500
on your cell phone

7552
05:07:52,500 --> 05:07:54,840
okay it's not impossible I mean I've

7553
05:07:54,840 --> 05:07:56,700
done it but

7554
05:07:56,700 --> 05:08:00,180
you are literally looking through

7555
05:08:00,180 --> 05:08:02,400
a very small window

7556
05:08:02,400 --> 05:08:05,878
of what is going on and it's very easy

7557
05:08:05,878 --> 05:08:07,440
to get

7558
05:08:07,440 --> 05:08:09,780
fixated on whatever you're seeing in

7559
05:08:09,780 --> 05:08:11,340
that small little four inch universe or

7560
05:08:11,340 --> 05:08:13,620
whatever your instrument is or tablet or

7561
05:08:13,620 --> 05:08:14,700
phone is

7562
05:08:14,700 --> 05:08:16,080
you're missing out on a lot of

7563
05:08:16,080 --> 05:08:18,660
information and the way I trade is I

7564
05:08:18,660 --> 05:08:20,280
look at all these other things I'm

7565
05:08:20,280 --> 05:08:21,660
showing you here today

7566
05:08:21,660 --> 05:08:24,540
each monitor has its own real estate

7567
05:08:24,540 --> 05:08:27,718
what it's responsible for What markets

7568
05:08:27,718 --> 05:08:30,060
to follow what time frames I have on

7569
05:08:30,060 --> 05:08:32,218
here all of those things I'm monitoring

7570
05:08:32,218 --> 05:08:35,218
I'm constantly getting a new refreshed

7571
05:08:35,218 --> 05:08:37,138
view of everything from the higher time

7572
05:08:37,138 --> 05:08:38,280
frame down

7573
05:08:38,280 --> 05:08:41,100
across a lot of markets that are closely

7574
05:08:41,100 --> 05:08:43,260
correlated so I'm using inter-market

7575
05:08:43,260 --> 05:08:46,260
relationships and

7576
05:08:46,260 --> 05:08:49,020
intra Market relationships so that way

7577
05:08:49,020 --> 05:08:50,638
there's a relationship between how

7578
05:08:50,638 --> 05:08:52,980
markets are either positive correlated

7579
05:08:52,980 --> 05:08:55,620
or inversely correlated and they should

7580
05:08:55,620 --> 05:08:58,980
agree on the most part I'm allowing for

7581
05:08:58,980 --> 05:09:01,980
this discrepancy or cracking correlation

7582
05:09:01,980 --> 05:09:04,798
where it's expected to form I do not

7583
05:09:04,798 --> 05:09:07,138
look at charts okay this is very

7584
05:09:07,138 --> 05:09:11,160
important I never look at charts for the

7585
05:09:11,160 --> 05:09:13,980
purposes of finding an smt diversions

7586
05:09:13,980 --> 05:09:16,680
look at the lows here

7587
05:09:16,680 --> 05:09:18,718
we have a higher low here

7588
05:09:18,718 --> 05:09:20,760
we have a higher low here but we have

7589
05:09:20,760 --> 05:09:24,718
the lower low on Dow see that okay here

7590
05:09:24,718 --> 05:09:27,600
that's a Divergence as SNT diversions

7591
05:09:27,600 --> 05:09:29,638
I used to when I was younger when I was

7592
05:09:29,638 --> 05:09:31,620
first dabbling into this I would only

7593
05:09:31,620 --> 05:09:33,780
look for it to form and trade based on

7594
05:09:33,780 --> 05:09:34,620
that

7595
05:09:34,620 --> 05:09:37,620
and I had my hands handed to me

7596
05:09:37,620 --> 05:09:39,120
it's only when you know where the

7597
05:09:39,120 --> 05:09:41,940
Market's likely to draw to it creates a

7598
05:09:41,940 --> 05:09:43,378
real measure of accumulation and

7599
05:09:43,378 --> 05:09:44,638
distribution

7600
05:09:44,638 --> 05:09:46,860
Larry Williams has a accumulation

7601
05:09:46,860 --> 05:09:48,600
distribution formula which when I first

7602
05:09:48,600 --> 05:09:49,920
learned about it I fell in love with it

7603
05:09:49,920 --> 05:09:53,638
and and for Commodities in you know

7604
05:09:53,638 --> 05:09:55,320
HTF price moves four hour

7605
05:09:55,320 --> 05:09:58,260
and daily I found that it was really

7606
05:09:58,260 --> 05:10:01,620
good but eventually you know it's just

7607
05:10:01,620 --> 05:10:03,560
didn't work as well as I wanted it to

7608
05:10:03,560 --> 05:10:06,958
and didn't form enough but I was using

7609
05:10:06,958 --> 05:10:08,820
it as a means of getting into some of my

7610
05:10:08,820 --> 05:10:10,560
trades when I would look for something

7611
05:10:10,560 --> 05:10:12,900
to go along the qualifying thing was the

7612
05:10:12,900 --> 05:10:14,340
50-day moving average would be bullish

7613
05:10:14,340 --> 05:10:16,320
in other words it's sloping up

7614
05:10:16,320 --> 05:10:18,958
and then I would look for an oversold

7615
05:10:18,958 --> 05:10:20,580
condition on an hourly chart with a

7616
05:10:20,580 --> 05:10:22,260
stochastic and the Williams percent are

7617
05:10:22,260 --> 05:10:25,260
being oversold than the very next day I

7618
05:10:25,260 --> 05:10:27,060
would look at the opening and as long as

7619
05:10:27,060 --> 05:10:30,540
it dropped from the opening price damn I

7620
05:10:30,540 --> 05:10:33,540
would chase that going into longs so I

7621
05:10:33,540 --> 05:10:35,638
would be on there buying it buying it I

7622
05:10:35,638 --> 05:10:36,900
would never want to go short I was

7623
05:10:36,900 --> 05:10:38,218
afraid to short I didn't know him I

7624
05:10:38,218 --> 05:10:39,780
didn't understand how to short so

7625
05:10:39,780 --> 05:10:41,458
everything I did was primarily gone long

7626
05:10:41,458 --> 05:10:45,180
so my model would be supercharged if I

7627
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:48,540
saw a accumulation distribution bullish

7628
05:10:48,540 --> 05:10:50,100
Divergence

7629
05:10:50,100 --> 05:10:53,218
so I don't want you thinking that it's a

7630
05:10:53,218 --> 05:10:55,560
Magic Bullet okay where all you have to

7631
05:10:55,560 --> 05:10:57,060
do is look for a Divergence and that's

7632
05:10:57,060 --> 05:10:59,820
your entry because Divergence is as you

7633
05:10:59,820 --> 05:11:01,440
saw earlier when I was showing you the

7634
05:11:01,440 --> 05:11:03,718
euro dollar events against the dollar

7635
05:11:03,718 --> 05:11:05,100
Index

7636
05:11:05,100 --> 05:11:07,560
um there was a smt diversions at the

7637
05:11:07,560 --> 05:11:09,540
time that would have been a qualifying

7638
05:11:09,540 --> 05:11:11,100
thing for me to say I'm done and I

7639
05:11:11,100 --> 05:11:13,500
wouldn't hold for the trade anymore

7640
05:11:13,500 --> 05:11:16,020
but you watched the dollar rotate go

7641
05:11:16,020 --> 05:11:17,700
lower and the euro dollar make it even

7642
05:11:17,700 --> 05:11:19,500
higher high so I would have missed

7643
05:11:19,500 --> 05:11:20,940
whatever that movements and if it's even

7644
05:11:20,940 --> 05:11:22,200
going higher I don't know I haven't seen

7645
05:11:22,200 --> 05:11:25,860
it since we talked about it but the

7646
05:11:25,860 --> 05:11:28,020
just for the purpose of smt alone that

7647
05:11:28,020 --> 05:11:30,180
Divergence does not mean anything

7648
05:11:30,180 --> 05:11:32,638
coupled with profit taking when it meets

7649
05:11:32,638 --> 05:11:34,440
the time of day where you should be

7650
05:11:34,440 --> 05:11:36,298
trying to you know close up shop or at

7651
05:11:36,298 --> 05:11:37,798
least try to get the majority of your

7652
05:11:37,798 --> 05:11:40,740
trade in in real profit and not open

7653
05:11:40,740 --> 05:11:42,718
profit where you actually take partials

7654
05:11:42,718 --> 05:11:45,180
and now you're booking that profit that

7655
05:11:45,180 --> 05:11:47,160
to me is more meaningful in the sense of

7656
05:11:47,160 --> 05:11:51,360
using it or if it does form an entry

7657
05:11:51,360 --> 05:11:53,458
with the smt diversion at the time of

7658
05:11:53,458 --> 05:11:55,320
day and it fits the criteria and your

7659
05:11:55,320 --> 05:11:57,060
drawing liquidity hasn't been reached or

7660
05:11:57,060 --> 05:12:00,000
targeted has been reached for yet then

7661
05:12:00,000 --> 05:12:02,160
then it's more meaningful to use it but

7662
05:12:02,160 --> 05:12:05,160
being in and of itself it's useless

7663
05:12:05,160 --> 05:12:07,500
okay it has to be used at the proper

7664
05:12:07,500 --> 05:12:10,560
context and I see a lot of new folks

7665
05:12:10,560 --> 05:12:11,820
that have just recently gone through

7666
05:12:11,820 --> 05:12:12,958
some of my stuff they're like you know I

7667
05:12:12,958 --> 05:12:14,218
don't hear you or see you talking about

7668
05:12:14,218 --> 05:12:15,600
smt

7669
05:12:15,600 --> 05:12:17,878
it's not required you know it's really

7670
05:12:17,878 --> 05:12:19,740
not it's just one of those things that

7671
05:12:19,740 --> 05:12:22,378
if it's there wonderful you know

7672
05:12:22,378 --> 05:12:24,718
um I don't look at cot every single day

7673
05:12:24,718 --> 05:12:27,120
I take a trade you don't need it it's

7674
05:12:27,120 --> 05:12:29,218
just a qualifying thing that just adds

7675
05:12:29,218 --> 05:12:31,200
more support to it if you're a long-term

7676
05:12:31,200 --> 05:12:32,878
position Trader

7677
05:12:32,878 --> 05:12:34,980
and you want to trade that way

7678
05:12:34,980 --> 05:12:37,500
commitment of Traders and seasonal

7679
05:12:37,500 --> 05:12:40,440
Tendencies coupled together

7680
05:12:40,440 --> 05:12:42,540
with what I was showing you here

7681
05:12:42,540 --> 05:12:45,000
that is a that's a winning recipe like

7682
05:12:45,000 --> 05:12:47,520
that that is a really good model and

7683
05:12:47,520 --> 05:12:48,958
just use the entry models that I've

7684
05:12:48,958 --> 05:12:51,600
taught like with the 2022 model or even

7685
05:12:51,600 --> 05:12:53,638
the Silver-Bullet trades

7686
05:12:53,638 --> 05:12:55,440
and you thought I wasn't going to answer

7687
05:12:55,440 --> 05:12:57,060
the thing you started to talk about why

7688
05:12:57,060 --> 05:12:59,458
Silver-Bullets

7689
05:12:59,458 --> 05:13:03,000
form and how how the deforming why is it

7690
05:13:03,000 --> 05:13:06,480
there they're always going to be there

7691
05:13:06,480 --> 05:13:08,280
because of

7692
05:13:08,280 --> 05:13:11,100
the first 30 minutes of

7693
05:13:11,100 --> 05:13:13,740
PD you have 30 minutes now

7694
05:13:13,740 --> 05:13:15,660
in the marketplace

7695
05:13:15,660 --> 05:13:18,060
The Rush The Mad Dash to get in and do

7696
05:13:18,060 --> 05:13:20,100
something to buy and sell that's already

7697
05:13:20,100 --> 05:13:21,780
in the marketplace now

7698
05:13:21,780 --> 05:13:24,620
the initial the initial surge of

7699
05:13:24,620 --> 05:13:26,940
institutional orders being thrown out

7700
05:13:26,940 --> 05:13:30,060
there for their clients or their own

7701
05:13:30,060 --> 05:13:32,458
that's in the market now too

7702
05:13:32,458 --> 05:13:34,798
so now we have 30 minutes behind us the

7703
05:13:34,798 --> 05:13:37,080
initial impulsiveness that usually comes

7704
05:13:37,080 --> 05:13:38,638
into the marketplace is now behind us

7705
05:13:38,638 --> 05:13:42,840
and now we're in the First full hour

7706
05:13:42,840 --> 05:13:47,298
of trading after the bow

7707
05:13:48,240 --> 05:13:50,340
the first 30 minutes is done

7708
05:13:50,340 --> 05:13:53,400
that's like the Asian range okay

7709
05:13:53,400 --> 05:13:57,120
now we have the real move London

7710
05:13:57,120 --> 05:13:59,100
think about it in the 24-hour cycle kind

7711
05:13:59,100 --> 05:14:00,480
of probably confusing some of you but

7712
05:14:00,480 --> 05:14:01,680
the long-term students know what I'm

7713
05:14:01,680 --> 05:14:04,378
talking about I'm looking at that that

7714
05:14:04,378 --> 05:14:06,900
range of

7715
05:14:06,900 --> 05:14:08,878
the intraday movement on the morning

7716
05:14:08,878 --> 05:14:11,760
session as the same impulsiveness that

7717
05:14:11,760 --> 05:14:13,320
comes into London where there's a lot of

7718
05:14:13,320 --> 05:14:15,780
volume that comes in in Forex that same

7719
05:14:15,780 --> 05:14:19,200
thing occurs in that first full hour of

7720
05:14:19,200 --> 05:14:21,240
10 to 11.

7721
05:14:21,240 --> 05:14:23,700
they all want to make a Mad Dash to find

7722
05:14:23,700 --> 05:14:25,500
profitability

7723
05:14:25,500 --> 05:14:28,260
and a lot of the algorithms wait for

7724
05:14:28,260 --> 05:14:31,260
that first impulsiveness to run higher

7725
05:14:31,260 --> 05:14:33,480
or lower and that inefficiency that you

7726
05:14:33,480 --> 05:14:34,980
find on the time frames and the models

7727
05:14:34,980 --> 05:14:38,878
I'm showing you they all dog pile on it

7728
05:14:38,878 --> 05:14:40,860
they're all dog piling on that one there

7729
05:14:40,860 --> 05:14:42,298
so

7730
05:14:42,298 --> 05:14:44,878
it's not a measure of the selling or

7731
05:14:44,878 --> 05:14:46,980
buying pressure that's pushing it it's

7732
05:14:46,980 --> 05:14:49,080
the algorithm itself is offering it to

7733
05:14:49,080 --> 05:14:49,798
them

7734
05:14:49,798 --> 05:14:51,600
it's going to move from that fair value

7735
05:14:51,600 --> 05:14:53,878
Gap to wherever it's going to go

7736
05:14:53,878 --> 05:14:55,378
regardless of how many people buy or

7737
05:14:55,378 --> 05:14:57,000
sell into that guy

7738
05:14:57,000 --> 05:14:59,940
it's it doesn't make a difference

7739
05:14:59,940 --> 05:15:02,700
everything in price is scripted it's

7740
05:15:02,700 --> 05:15:04,320
completely manipulated it's absolutely

7741
05:15:04,320 --> 05:15:06,420
controlled and the only thing you're

7742
05:15:06,420 --> 05:15:08,520
trying to do is look for that small

7743
05:15:08,520 --> 05:15:11,458
little inefficiency when you know where

7744
05:15:11,458 --> 05:15:13,020
you're aiming for you're aiming for some

7745
05:15:13,020 --> 05:15:14,820
HTF Target

7746
05:15:14,820 --> 05:15:18,200
like we outlined for a euro dollar and

7747
05:15:18,200 --> 05:15:21,840
the dollar Index

7748
05:15:21,840 --> 05:15:25,798
if you have a HTF bias

7749
05:15:25,798 --> 05:15:27,480
and we know that that's a directional

7750
05:15:27,480 --> 05:15:29,340
bias that's looking for a reason to go

7751
05:15:29,340 --> 05:15:30,600
higher

7752
05:15:30,600 --> 05:15:32,420
it would make sense for us to expect

7753
05:15:32,420 --> 05:15:36,240
some kind of run higher from 9 30

7754
05:15:36,240 --> 05:15:38,520
going into 10 o'clock

7755
05:15:38,520 --> 05:15:41,878
in looking backwards in seeing in that

7756
05:15:41,878 --> 05:15:43,798
price run higher was there any

7757
05:15:43,798 --> 05:15:46,620
inefficiency or fair value you got

7758
05:15:46,620 --> 05:15:49,320
if there is then we can use that as an

7759
05:15:49,320 --> 05:15:51,540
entry that has to happen

7760
05:15:51,540 --> 05:15:53,878
at 10 o'clock

7761
05:15:53,878 --> 05:15:55,378
till 11 o'clock

7762
05:15:55,378 --> 05:15:57,180
the FVG doesn't have to form

7763
05:15:57,180 --> 05:16:00,240
in itself inside of that one hour period

7764
05:16:00,240 --> 05:16:03,420
it can refer back to some Fairway Gap

7765
05:16:03,420 --> 05:16:05,520
that formed you know in the run-up if

7766
05:16:05,520 --> 05:16:08,040
it's bullish between 9 30 and 10 o'clock

7767
05:16:08,040 --> 05:16:09,360
and if you're bearish and you're

7768
05:16:09,360 --> 05:16:11,340
expecting it to move lower the fair

7769
05:16:11,340 --> 05:16:13,920
value Gap could form in the move from 9

7770
05:16:13,920 --> 05:16:17,100
30's opening down to 10 o'clocks low so

7771
05:16:17,100 --> 05:16:19,260
that price leg wherever the fair value

7772
05:16:19,260 --> 05:16:21,298
would reside there it can return up into

7773
05:16:21,298 --> 05:16:22,980
that many times you're going to see a

7774
05:16:22,980 --> 05:16:24,360
lot of the trades that I've taken in the

7775
05:16:24,360 --> 05:16:26,340
past if you go I I was one of the things

7776
05:16:26,340 --> 05:16:28,320
I want to ask you as a community I know

7777
05:16:28,320 --> 05:16:30,718
some of you out here save everything I

7778
05:16:30,718 --> 05:16:32,580
do and I love you for that

7779
05:16:32,580 --> 05:16:35,100
has anybody got a full collection of

7780
05:16:35,100 --> 05:16:37,260
every single execution I've ever made

7781
05:16:37,260 --> 05:16:38,340
public

7782
05:16:38,340 --> 05:16:40,200
because I I don't know where they're at

7783
05:16:40,200 --> 05:16:42,540
once I put them out on Twitter like I

7784
05:16:42,540 --> 05:16:44,820
don't know how to find them there's a

7785
05:16:44,820 --> 05:16:45,900
lot of them I just don't know where

7786
05:16:45,900 --> 05:16:47,760
they're all at if someone could like

7787
05:16:47,760 --> 05:16:49,920
create a

7788
05:16:49,920 --> 05:16:53,420
I don't know maybe

7789
05:16:56,400 --> 05:16:57,540
a thread

7790
05:16:57,540 --> 05:16:59,100
and throw them on that that'll be

7791
05:16:59,100 --> 05:17:01,740
awesome I'll retweet it if you do it but

7792
05:17:01,740 --> 05:17:03,660
the I would like to see them all and

7793
05:17:03,660 --> 05:17:05,878
you can see a lot of things I'm teaching

7794
05:17:05,878 --> 05:17:08,340
you will make much more sense to you now

7795
05:17:08,340 --> 05:17:09,718
that I'm I'm teaching you like this

7796
05:17:09,718 --> 05:17:11,580
you'll go back and say oh there it

7797
05:17:11,580 --> 05:17:13,200
is I can see he just talked about that

7798
05:17:13,200 --> 05:17:15,900
there it is he's doing it but in the

7799
05:17:15,900 --> 05:17:17,580
early stages I wasn't trying to teach a

7800
05:17:17,580 --> 05:17:19,680
lot of that because you know I even told

7801
05:17:19,680 --> 05:17:21,360
my private mentorship groups I said look

7802
05:17:21,360 --> 05:17:24,298
you know I'm gonna demonstrate it but

7803
05:17:24,298 --> 05:17:26,400
I'm not gonna go into into detail about

7804
05:17:26,400 --> 05:17:28,740
what it all is until some jackasses want

7805
05:17:28,740 --> 05:17:29,878
us to go out there and start selling my

7806
05:17:29,878 --> 05:17:31,860
videos so now I killed that whole show

7807
05:17:31,860 --> 05:17:34,260
and put the core content videos up on my

7808
05:17:34,260 --> 05:17:36,000
YouTube channel that's known that's

7809
05:17:36,000 --> 05:17:37,138
another reason why it's not coming down

7810
05:17:37,138 --> 05:17:39,240
when I leave in November

7811
05:17:39,240 --> 05:17:40,860
so anyway

7812
05:17:40,860 --> 05:17:42,240
um

7813
05:17:42,240 --> 05:17:45,780
we talked about

7814
05:17:45,780 --> 05:17:49,260
gold too and when I do gold and I'll

7815
05:17:49,260 --> 05:17:51,360
I'll teach you the FMC setups and we're

7816
05:17:51,360 --> 05:17:53,280
done for today

7817
05:17:53,280 --> 05:17:55,020
let's go into gold let's go to a daily

7818
05:17:55,020 --> 05:17:57,260
chart

7819
05:17:57,840 --> 05:18:00,740
and

7820
05:18:06,120 --> 05:18:08,700
I always use forex.com I don't have an

7821
05:18:08,700 --> 05:18:11,100
account with them that's just the feed I

7822
05:18:11,100 --> 05:18:13,320
go with and I trust that one

7823
05:18:13,320 --> 05:18:16,200
I don't look at Orlando or pepperstone I

7824
05:18:16,200 --> 05:18:18,000
don't use any of these other ones it

7825
05:18:18,000 --> 05:18:21,378
helps provide

7826
05:18:21,718 --> 05:18:23,580
a consistent medium for everyone because

7827
05:18:23,580 --> 05:18:25,320
especially if we're using

7828
05:18:25,320 --> 05:18:27,600
Forex if you look at different Brokers

7829
05:18:27,600 --> 05:18:28,560
they're going to have a different

7830
05:18:28,560 --> 05:18:30,420
opinion about what the high and low was

7831
05:18:30,420 --> 05:18:31,740
right

7832
05:18:31,740 --> 05:18:34,680
all right so anyway gold

7833
05:18:34,680 --> 05:18:37,680
I at first when I opened it up I said

7834
05:18:37,680 --> 05:18:40,020
you know I wouldn't touch it I wouldn't

7835
05:18:40,020 --> 05:18:41,280
I don't know

7836
05:18:41,280 --> 05:18:44,340
but like I always do I say gun to my

7837
05:18:44,340 --> 05:18:45,298
head

7838
05:18:45,298 --> 05:18:46,798
I said I think we're gonna go below the

7839
05:18:46,798 --> 05:18:47,940
SS here these relative equal

7840
05:18:47,940 --> 05:18:48,958
loads

7841
05:18:48,958 --> 05:18:51,958
so again you can find that at the 20

7842
05:18:51,958 --> 05:18:54,120
minute and five second

7843
05:18:54,120 --> 05:18:58,020
marker of the June 13th 2023 video with

7844
05:18:58,020 --> 05:19:00,840
analysis okay so let's go into this and

7845
05:19:00,840 --> 05:19:02,878
we'll segue into the four oh not the

7846
05:19:02,878 --> 05:19:05,400
Forex but the FOMC how to trade it and

7847
05:19:05,400 --> 05:19:06,660
it's the same premise that I'm going to

7848
05:19:06,660 --> 05:19:07,980
teach you that it's the same application

7849
05:19:07,980 --> 05:19:10,378
whether you're trading non-profit

7850
05:19:10,378 --> 05:19:12,180
payroll or

7851
05:19:12,180 --> 05:19:12,958
um

7852
05:19:12,958 --> 05:19:16,260
FMC they're treated the same way FOMC

7853
05:19:16,260 --> 05:19:17,820
generally is a much more larger

7854
05:19:17,820 --> 05:19:19,740
magnitude of a move but there's they're

7855
05:19:19,740 --> 05:19:22,560
using the same macro they use the same

7856
05:19:22,560 --> 05:19:25,440
thing it always happens the same way

7857
05:19:25,440 --> 05:19:28,080
it's just a much more muted

7858
05:19:28,080 --> 05:19:30,718
event when it's NFP so

7859
05:19:30,718 --> 05:19:32,520
anyway I took your attention into these

7860
05:19:32,520 --> 05:19:34,138
relative equal lows I said okay I think

7861
05:19:34,138 --> 05:19:35,520
it's going to go there

7862
05:19:35,520 --> 05:19:37,798
so that's what I thought was going to be

7863
05:19:37,798 --> 05:19:39,718
the draw that's where I thought we would

7864
05:19:39,718 --> 05:19:41,580
reach for and I didn't say anything

7865
05:19:41,580 --> 05:19:43,740
beyond that okay I didn't say anything

7866
05:19:43,740 --> 05:19:45,480
lower I didn't say anything higher I

7867
05:19:45,480 --> 05:19:46,680
said you know this is we're going to

7868
05:19:46,680 --> 05:19:47,520
reach for

7869
05:19:47,520 --> 05:19:50,458
so that was said to you on the 13th of

7870
05:19:50,458 --> 05:19:52,980
June so let's go into a 15 minute chart

7871
05:19:52,980 --> 05:19:54,710
we'll get through this one pretty quick

7872
05:19:54,710 --> 05:19:57,759
[Music]

7873
05:19:57,840 --> 05:20:00,000
take a 10 minute break and then I'll

7874
05:20:00,000 --> 05:20:01,378
come back and teach you how to trade

7875
05:20:01,378 --> 05:20:03,540
FOMC and NFP

7876
05:20:03,540 --> 05:20:07,400
and then we'll bid each other farewell

7877
05:20:08,550 --> 05:20:11,520
[Music]

7878
05:20:11,520 --> 05:20:13,878
okay

7879
05:20:14,820 --> 05:20:17,520
all right so this line is that level

7880
05:20:17,520 --> 05:20:19,020
from the daily chart which is the

7881
05:20:19,020 --> 05:20:21,378
relative equal lows it's the

7882
05:20:21,378 --> 05:20:23,580
1938.20 level

7883
05:20:23,580 --> 05:20:25,920
okay and

7884
05:20:25,920 --> 05:20:29,100
we would be looking for a drop down when

7885
05:20:29,100 --> 05:20:30,780
you're going lower and I should have

7886
05:20:30,780 --> 05:20:32,340
dropped into a 60 Minute chart when I

7887
05:20:32,340 --> 05:20:35,240
drop into a 15.

7888
05:20:35,878 --> 05:20:38,458
okay so those are those relative equals

7889
05:20:38,458 --> 05:20:41,218
from the daily but now seen on an hourly

7890
05:20:41,218 --> 05:20:42,000
chart

7891
05:20:42,000 --> 05:20:43,260
and

7892
05:20:43,260 --> 05:20:46,200
you can see on the 13th we created

7893
05:20:46,200 --> 05:20:48,660
another low here so resting below here

7894
05:20:48,660 --> 05:20:52,980
was a large pool of what kind of stops

7895
05:20:52,980 --> 05:20:55,980
sell stops why would they be sell stops

7896
05:20:55,980 --> 05:20:57,660
down there because look at the movement

7897
05:20:57,660 --> 05:20:59,700
from here up

7898
05:20:59,700 --> 05:21:01,980
Traders are going to chase that it goes

7899
05:21:01,980 --> 05:21:04,500
down they see it doesn't go here and it

7900
05:21:04,500 --> 05:21:06,958
rips one more time so what are they what

7901
05:21:06,958 --> 05:21:09,000
are they trying to sell the idea of when

7902
05:21:09,000 --> 05:21:12,480
I say they it's the real market makers

7903
05:21:12,480 --> 05:21:13,980
it's the folks that are controlling

7904
05:21:13,980 --> 05:21:16,320
price and yes gold is one of the highest

7905
05:21:16,320 --> 05:21:19,260
manipulated instruments there is it's

7906
05:21:19,260 --> 05:21:21,240
literally a joke and that's why I don't

7907
05:21:21,240 --> 05:21:23,280
like trading it I know a lot of you like

7908
05:21:23,280 --> 05:21:25,378
to ask about all the time but this one

7909
05:21:25,378 --> 05:21:28,798
is extremely manipulated it's like the

7910
05:21:28,798 --> 05:21:31,200
Japanese Yen like I can't stand it okay

7911
05:21:31,200 --> 05:21:33,840
it's so absolutely ridiculous how

7912
05:21:33,840 --> 05:21:36,120
controlled it is I choose not to touch

7913
05:21:36,120 --> 05:21:39,540
it and just like the Swiss franc too

7914
05:21:39,540 --> 05:21:41,780
good grief he's leaving everything

7915
05:21:41,780 --> 05:21:44,280
the weather this low and this low their

7916
05:21:44,280 --> 05:21:46,860
cell stops below this low sells though

7917
05:21:46,860 --> 05:21:49,200
so they were selling the idea that this

7918
05:21:49,200 --> 05:21:50,638
is a trading range and buy everything

7919
05:21:50,638 --> 05:21:51,718
think about it there's so many people

7920
05:21:51,718 --> 05:21:52,740
out there on YouTube they're still

7921
05:21:52,740 --> 05:21:55,440
making videos like this today

7922
05:21:55,440 --> 05:21:57,480
I have a range here every time I get to

7923
05:21:57,480 --> 05:21:58,920
the low end of the range you got to buy

7924
05:21:58,920 --> 05:22:00,420
it and you can make money every time and

7925
05:22:00,420 --> 05:22:02,900
all of a sudden

7926
05:22:03,660 --> 05:22:05,700
I did that kind of stuff

7927
05:22:05,700 --> 05:22:09,060
at 20 years old I did all that

7928
05:22:09,060 --> 05:22:10,680
the indicators and the oscillators will

7929
05:22:10,680 --> 05:22:12,060
tell you every single one of these loads

7930
05:22:12,060 --> 05:22:14,458
at the perfect oversold condition and

7931
05:22:14,458 --> 05:22:16,020
that's what tricks you

7932
05:22:16,020 --> 05:22:17,700
so when I stopped looking at the market

7933
05:22:17,700 --> 05:22:18,900
like that and looked at it from

7934
05:22:18,900 --> 05:22:21,480
liquidity or inefficiency then I didn't

7935
05:22:21,480 --> 05:22:24,060
rely on the Uber oversold I could see a

7936
05:22:24,060 --> 05:22:25,798
robot oversold relative to the range

7937
05:22:25,798 --> 05:22:27,660
that we're trading in which is really

7938
05:22:27,660 --> 05:22:30,240
what mathematically is being done and

7939
05:22:30,240 --> 05:22:33,180
tortured in in indicators like you're

7940
05:22:33,180 --> 05:22:36,780
defining a look back period generally 14

7941
05:22:36,780 --> 05:22:39,718
period 10 period nine period and then

7942
05:22:39,718 --> 05:22:40,798
you're

7943
05:22:40,798 --> 05:22:42,958
basing that range as high as high and

7944
05:22:42,958 --> 05:22:44,638
low is low and where you're at in

7945
05:22:44,638 --> 05:22:46,860
relationship to that so you need an

7946
05:22:46,860 --> 05:22:49,080
oscillator to tell you that like this

7947
05:22:49,080 --> 05:22:52,020
right here we're above 50 of this High

7948
05:22:52,020 --> 05:22:53,700
to that low

7949
05:22:53,700 --> 05:22:55,878
below these lows is SS liquidity

7950
05:22:55,878 --> 05:22:57,958
the gun to my head I told you that's

7951
05:22:57,958 --> 05:23:00,000
where I think we're going to trade to so

7952
05:23:00,000 --> 05:23:01,560
is it higher

7953
05:23:01,560 --> 05:23:03,660
after the 13th when I told you that no

7954
05:23:03,660 --> 05:23:05,638
it only went up

7955
05:23:05,638 --> 05:23:07,798
to go to a short-term premium

7956
05:23:07,798 --> 05:23:09,600
the short-term premium is relative to

7957
05:23:09,600 --> 05:23:10,560
this high

7958
05:23:10,560 --> 05:23:13,580
down that low

7959
05:23:19,440 --> 05:23:21,360
at equilibrium

7960
05:23:21,360 --> 05:23:23,340
or higher as a premium

7961
05:23:23,340 --> 05:23:26,218
we're definitely in a premium okay so we

7962
05:23:26,218 --> 05:23:27,900
don't need to see an oscillator tell you

7963
05:23:27,900 --> 05:23:30,600
it's over bar oversold it's defined by

7964
05:23:30,600 --> 05:23:31,798
that

7965
05:23:31,798 --> 05:23:34,500
if you pulled up a Williams for sonar 10

7966
05:23:34,500 --> 05:23:37,260
period or a stochastic it's going to

7967
05:23:37,260 --> 05:23:39,180
show you overbought right there I don't

7968
05:23:39,180 --> 05:23:40,320
need to see that I already know it's

7969
05:23:40,320 --> 05:23:42,718
there once you understand how to read

7970
05:23:42,718 --> 05:23:44,760
price and read what range you're in

7971
05:23:44,760 --> 05:23:46,620
presently

7972
05:23:46,620 --> 05:23:49,620
it's easy to identify what is a robot or

7973
05:23:49,620 --> 05:23:51,060
result and you don't need any indicator

7974
05:23:51,060 --> 05:23:54,180
to tell you that you don't need to see a

7975
05:23:54,180 --> 05:23:56,580
moving average crossover or a macd to

7976
05:23:56,580 --> 05:23:58,440
tell you where Market flow or Market

7977
05:23:58,440 --> 05:24:00,360
momentum is pointing

7978
05:24:00,360 --> 05:24:02,580
look at what it's doing

7979
05:24:02,580 --> 05:24:05,040
it's building a narrative that this is

7980
05:24:05,040 --> 05:24:07,620
supposed to be trusted as support

7981
05:24:07,620 --> 05:24:09,360
and that's building

7982
05:24:09,360 --> 05:24:12,900
in engineering SS liquidity

7983
05:24:12,900 --> 05:24:14,760
so when that occurs

7984
05:24:14,760 --> 05:24:16,200
and I'm sure some of you watched it

7985
05:24:16,200 --> 05:24:18,298
rallying up here and thought you know on

7986
05:24:18,298 --> 05:24:21,180
the 14th ict's got it wrong

7987
05:24:21,180 --> 05:24:22,920
and the only thing I did is trade up

7988
05:24:22,920 --> 05:24:25,680
into a premium and then wipe out

7989
05:24:25,680 --> 05:24:28,620
they ran right for those cell stops what

7990
05:24:28,620 --> 05:24:30,780
was the reaction after it did that look

7991
05:24:30,780 --> 05:24:33,180
where we're at now

7992
05:24:33,180 --> 05:24:36,240
now I'm not suggesting that there isn't

7993
05:24:36,240 --> 05:24:37,860
opportunity in this market or there

7994
05:24:37,860 --> 05:24:39,060
wasn't an opportunity because there

7995
05:24:39,060 --> 05:24:40,378
really was

7996
05:24:40,378 --> 05:24:42,298
I don't want to trade in these Market

7997
05:24:42,298 --> 05:24:44,340
environments there was a time as a young

7998
05:24:44,340 --> 05:24:47,160
man in my 20s I wanted to capture these

7999
05:24:47,160 --> 05:24:49,200
moves from here to here and here to here

8000
05:24:49,200 --> 05:24:50,400
and here to here I wanted to be in

8001
05:24:50,400 --> 05:24:51,600
everything

8002
05:24:51,600 --> 05:24:54,000
and I discerned that

8003
05:24:54,000 --> 05:24:56,280
while it's possible I didn't have the

8004
05:24:56,280 --> 05:24:58,320
aptitude to be able to do that yet and I

8005
05:24:58,320 --> 05:25:00,360
lost money in blue accounts trying to do

8006
05:25:00,360 --> 05:25:03,060
that trying to learn how to do it with

8007
05:25:03,060 --> 05:25:04,020
real money

8008
05:25:04,020 --> 05:25:06,240
it does not work you have to know what

8009
05:25:06,240 --> 05:25:07,560
you're doing and be bored with the

8010
05:25:07,560 --> 05:25:08,760
things that you're doing in that process

8011
05:25:08,760 --> 05:25:10,560
over and over and over again before you

8012
05:25:10,560 --> 05:25:12,000
even think about putting real money in

8013
05:25:12,000 --> 05:25:14,280
there so anyway let's take a closer look

8014
05:25:14,280 --> 05:25:15,718
with the 15 minute time frame now we

8015
05:25:15,718 --> 05:25:18,000
have that context

8016
05:25:18,000 --> 05:25:20,340
at two o'clock yesterday

8017
05:25:20,340 --> 05:25:23,218
there was an event that took place

8018
05:25:23,218 --> 05:25:26,540
and what event was that

8019
05:25:27,420 --> 05:25:30,440
FOMC right

8020
05:25:31,860 --> 05:25:35,180
so at two o'clock

8021
05:25:35,540 --> 05:25:38,040
whenever there's an FOMC

8022
05:25:38,040 --> 05:25:39,360
event

8023
05:25:39,360 --> 05:25:41,218
it's to be treated

8024
05:25:41,218 --> 05:25:43,138
in two stages

8025
05:25:43,138 --> 05:25:45,620
okay

8026
05:25:45,840 --> 05:25:47,878
this is going to be a general rule of

8027
05:25:47,878 --> 05:25:50,100
thumb it will serve you more times than

8028
05:25:50,100 --> 05:25:50,878
not

8029
05:25:50,878 --> 05:25:52,740
you will lose money on it eventually if

8030
05:25:52,740 --> 05:25:54,718
you push it every single time I promise

8031
05:25:54,718 --> 05:25:57,420
you that but if you go back and study

8032
05:25:57,420 --> 05:26:00,420
old moves you'll be quickly convinced

8033
05:26:00,420 --> 05:26:01,860
that what I'm about to tell you my

8034
05:26:01,860 --> 05:26:03,958
long-term students know this and we

8035
05:26:03,958 --> 05:26:07,500
expect it all the time I had two folks

8036
05:26:07,500 --> 05:26:10,260
tweeted me yesterday who I unfor I I

8037
05:26:10,260 --> 05:26:11,760
can't I can't deal with people if you're

8038
05:26:11,760 --> 05:26:13,260
going to come in and you show me this

8039
05:26:13,260 --> 05:26:14,520
type of

8040
05:26:14,520 --> 05:26:16,500
perspective or mindset you are not ready

8041
05:26:16,500 --> 05:26:18,600
to learn from me so I I just block them

8042
05:26:18,600 --> 05:26:20,878
it's not because I don't want to take

8043
05:26:20,878 --> 05:26:22,080
heat from people because I'm my best

8044
05:26:22,080 --> 05:26:24,360
trolls my biggest trolls are not blocked

8045
05:26:24,360 --> 05:26:27,120
by me so it's not a thin-skinned type

8046
05:26:27,120 --> 05:26:30,600
thing I I don't have time or energy to

8047
05:26:30,600 --> 05:26:32,280
deal with people that are close-minded

8048
05:26:32,280 --> 05:26:34,440
and if you're brand new and you come to

8049
05:26:34,440 --> 05:26:35,878
me on Twitter

8050
05:26:35,878 --> 05:26:38,820
and I share an example of me executing

8051
05:26:38,820 --> 05:26:41,360
I hate seeing all after the fact again

8052
05:26:41,360 --> 05:26:44,180
or someone supporting that idea

8053
05:26:44,180 --> 05:26:46,378
immediately you're showing me that you

8054
05:26:46,378 --> 05:26:48,660
are not there to learn or you're not in

8055
05:26:48,660 --> 05:26:50,340
the proper mindset so I broom you quick

8056
05:26:50,340 --> 05:26:52,260
I get rid of you

8057
05:26:52,260 --> 05:26:54,000
um

8058
05:26:54,000 --> 05:26:56,218
if you think you know everything or if

8059
05:26:56,218 --> 05:26:58,138
you think I owe you an execution to put

8060
05:26:58,138 --> 05:26:59,900
you into a trade that you can copy me

8061
05:26:59,900 --> 05:27:02,878
you don't know who I am I'm not

8062
05:27:02,878 --> 05:27:04,920
promising you that and that's one of the

8063
05:27:04,920 --> 05:27:06,718
biggest things a pet peeve I don't want

8064
05:27:06,718 --> 05:27:08,700
anybody being able to copy me

8065
05:27:08,700 --> 05:27:10,260
I got people constantly asking me what's

8066
05:27:10,260 --> 05:27:12,360
the color of your candles I know why

8067
05:27:12,360 --> 05:27:13,560
because they want to take the videos

8068
05:27:13,560 --> 05:27:14,700
like this one that doesn't have a

8069
05:27:14,700 --> 05:27:17,638
watermark on it and anytime I do an

8070
05:27:17,638 --> 05:27:20,040
execution unless I have my watermark in

8071
05:27:20,040 --> 05:27:22,260
it you know they invariably find their

8072
05:27:22,260 --> 05:27:25,020
way on to tick tock they're on Instagram

8073
05:27:25,020 --> 05:27:27,298
they're on Facebook they're on YouTube

8074
05:27:27,298 --> 05:27:29,520
under somebody else's thing saying they

8075
05:27:29,520 --> 05:27:33,000
took the trade so I don't like that okay

8076
05:27:33,000 --> 05:27:36,480
I know I know my own trades I don't need

8077
05:27:36,480 --> 05:27:39,000
the like they can you can block out

8078
05:27:39,000 --> 05:27:40,740
everything I know who who's trading that

8079
05:27:40,740 --> 05:27:42,718
if I'm looking at I know it's me

8080
05:27:42,718 --> 05:27:44,458
and everybody else can recognize when

8081
05:27:44,458 --> 05:27:46,440
I'm trading because you know it is what

8082
05:27:46,440 --> 05:27:47,820
it is

8083
05:27:47,820 --> 05:27:50,520
but I don't want people copying me so if

8084
05:27:50,520 --> 05:27:51,840
you're new like this is the first time

8085
05:27:51,840 --> 05:27:53,218
you listen to me

8086
05:27:53,218 --> 05:27:55,200
I call things before it happens and

8087
05:27:55,200 --> 05:27:56,700
people will tell you it's easy to do

8088
05:27:56,700 --> 05:27:58,860
that anybody can do that but these same

8089
05:27:58,860 --> 05:28:00,900
people are all day long saying well we

8090
05:28:00,900 --> 05:28:01,920
gotta watch and see what's going on up

8091
05:28:01,920 --> 05:28:04,378
here oh well it could go down here you

8092
05:28:04,378 --> 05:28:05,458
got to be careful oh no it's getting

8093
05:28:05,458 --> 05:28:07,200
tight in here and all of a sudden after

8094
05:28:07,200 --> 05:28:09,060
the fact they'll say I did not call this

8095
05:28:09,060 --> 05:28:11,400
stuff no I say gun to my head this is

8096
05:28:11,400 --> 05:28:13,020
what the gonna happen and there

8097
05:28:13,020 --> 05:28:15,958
it is even if I'm not certain I will

8098
05:28:15,958 --> 05:28:17,458
tell you what side I'm on and I'm

8099
05:28:17,458 --> 05:28:18,660
comfortable being wrong in those

8100
05:28:18,660 --> 05:28:20,160
instances but when I don't say a gun to

8101
05:28:20,160 --> 05:28:21,660
my head and I say this is where I think

8102
05:28:21,660 --> 05:28:23,458
it's going to happen bet your

8103
05:28:23,458 --> 05:28:25,138
ass is going there okay that's what's

8104
05:28:25,138 --> 05:28:28,500
happening so I'm not in this business to

8105
05:28:28,500 --> 05:28:30,240
try to have an opportunity for all of

8106
05:28:30,240 --> 05:28:32,760
you to copycat me I am in this business

8107
05:28:32,760 --> 05:28:34,680
to tell you how to do this

8108
05:28:34,680 --> 05:28:36,840
I don't need to be doing this but I want

8109
05:28:36,840 --> 05:28:39,060
you to succeed but you will not succeed

8110
05:28:39,060 --> 05:28:41,940
by copying me or trying to get money

8111
05:28:41,940 --> 05:28:43,620
right now because you're short on change

8112
05:28:43,620 --> 05:28:45,480
and that'll inspire you to do if you

8113
05:28:45,480 --> 05:28:46,980
don't want to learn how to do this by

8114
05:28:46,980 --> 05:28:48,840
what I've already shown or taught or see

8115
05:28:48,840 --> 05:28:51,600
my students doing nothing's going to

8116
05:28:51,600 --> 05:28:53,840
convince you so that's why I I

8117
05:28:53,840 --> 05:28:56,280
distinguish the the grade of student

8118
05:28:56,280 --> 05:28:59,100
that comes to me the people that just

8119
05:28:59,100 --> 05:29:01,378
simply want to listen learn and practice

8120
05:29:01,378 --> 05:29:04,200
and put the time into it they're not

8121
05:29:04,200 --> 05:29:05,580
going to complain and they're not going

8122
05:29:05,580 --> 05:29:06,840
to ask for more than I've already given

8123
05:29:06,840 --> 05:29:08,700
and that's the people I'm teaching

8124
05:29:08,700 --> 05:29:10,500
that's the people that keeps me coming

8125
05:29:10,500 --> 05:29:11,638
back here

8126
05:29:11,638 --> 05:29:14,400
I broom entitlement I get rid of that

8127
05:29:14,400 --> 05:29:15,958
 I don't want I don't have any

8128
05:29:15,958 --> 05:29:17,760
tolerance for it and you can have the

8129
05:29:17,760 --> 05:29:19,138
opinion of me whatever you want I don't

8130
05:29:19,138 --> 05:29:21,120
care but I'm the only out

8131
05:29:21,120 --> 05:29:22,560
here that's telling you where it's going

8132
05:29:22,560 --> 05:29:25,200
to go precisely every single week and

8133
05:29:25,200 --> 05:29:28,740
I'm asking nothing for it nothing

8134
05:29:28,740 --> 05:29:31,680
I'm I'm here all day today

8135
05:29:31,680 --> 05:29:33,718
so just know

8136
05:29:33,718 --> 05:29:36,420
that you're not obligated to be here and

8137
05:29:36,420 --> 05:29:37,798
not sure as and I'm going to

8138
05:29:37,798 --> 05:29:40,080
teach you any of this I love doing it

8139
05:29:40,080 --> 05:29:42,660
but I if if you come to me on social

8140
05:29:42,660 --> 05:29:43,920
media

8141
05:29:43,920 --> 05:29:46,080
and you talk that nonsense to me with an

8142
05:29:46,080 --> 05:29:48,480
entitlement mindset or oh it's after the

8143
05:29:48,480 --> 05:29:50,100
fact and you didn't go through the

8144
05:29:50,100 --> 05:29:51,900
process of hearing me explain how all

8145
05:29:51,900 --> 05:29:53,520
these things happen I've already taught

8146
05:29:53,520 --> 05:29:55,378
how this works and the reason why I'm

8147
05:29:55,378 --> 05:29:56,940
saying this because I'm about to teach

8148
05:29:56,940 --> 05:30:00,060
you how to trade FOMC and it's the same

8149
05:30:00,060 --> 05:30:02,580
thing with NFP

8150
05:30:02,580 --> 05:30:04,980
same macro that's being utilized okay

8151
05:30:04,980 --> 05:30:08,100
it's a two-stage macro that means it's a

8152
05:30:08,100 --> 05:30:12,240
first run and then reversal okay it

8153
05:30:12,240 --> 05:30:13,680
doesn't happen every single hundred

8154
05:30:13,680 --> 05:30:15,540
percent of time but most of the time

8155
05:30:15,540 --> 05:30:17,458
unless they intervene that's what the

8156
05:30:17,458 --> 05:30:19,500
macro will do

8157
05:30:19,500 --> 05:30:21,840
it will go to levels as you watch me

8158
05:30:21,840 --> 05:30:24,120
call out on the CPI

8159
05:30:24,120 --> 05:30:25,860
I told you where the FVG was

8160
05:30:25,860 --> 05:30:27,958
I told you where the two pools of

8161
05:30:27,958 --> 05:30:30,780
liquidity the very specific elements

8162
05:30:30,780 --> 05:30:33,120
that led to that delivery at CPI

8163
05:30:33,120 --> 05:30:35,040
it happened

8164
05:30:35,040 --> 05:30:37,378
you can't trade it it's happening too

8165
05:30:37,378 --> 05:30:38,878
fast and the broker will not let you get

8166
05:30:38,878 --> 05:30:40,798
filled anybody that shows you them

8167
05:30:40,798 --> 05:30:43,560
getting filled that is a white

8168
05:30:43,560 --> 05:30:46,560
label fake mt4 horseshit it's fake it's

8169
05:30:46,560 --> 05:30:48,060
fake it's fake I don't give a who

8170
05:30:48,060 --> 05:30:50,400
you are it's fake you are not getting

8171
05:30:50,400 --> 05:30:51,840
filled on those things it's not

8172
05:30:51,840 --> 05:30:55,340
happening period

8173
05:30:55,980 --> 05:30:58,378
but if you wait until these reports come

8174
05:30:58,378 --> 05:30:59,400
out

8175
05:30:59,400 --> 05:31:02,878
in that first initial Surge and they put

8176
05:31:02,878 --> 05:31:05,760
the the availability of the trade back

8177
05:31:05,760 --> 05:31:07,200
in place

8178
05:31:07,200 --> 05:31:09,060
all Brokers pull their they don't

8179
05:31:09,060 --> 05:31:10,500
they don't want to be getting caught on

8180
05:31:10,500 --> 05:31:12,900
the the wrong side of some goober that

8181
05:31:12,900 --> 05:31:14,400
got lucky

8182
05:31:14,400 --> 05:31:16,080
that's the reason why it happens folks

8183
05:31:16,080 --> 05:31:17,820
it's not because nobody wants to trade

8184
05:31:17,820 --> 05:31:19,680
it or they're scared they the broker

8185
05:31:19,680 --> 05:31:21,060
doesn't want to have that incurred risk

8186
05:31:21,060 --> 05:31:23,040
that's the reality that's it that's

8187
05:31:23,040 --> 05:31:25,320
what's going on okay but they caught

8188
05:31:25,320 --> 05:31:27,298
something else because think about when

8189
05:31:27,298 --> 05:31:28,620
you look at that perspective it's like

8190
05:31:28,620 --> 05:31:30,480
you you know I could be making

8191
05:31:30,480 --> 05:31:31,620
money right here and you're preventing

8192
05:31:31,620 --> 05:31:32,820
yeah that's exactly what they're doing

8193
05:31:32,820 --> 05:31:34,440
they're saving their own ass they're

8194
05:31:34,440 --> 05:31:35,878
protecting themselves and guess what I'd

8195
05:31:35,878 --> 05:31:37,798
be doing the same thing

8196
05:31:37,798 --> 05:31:40,500
because you can get lucky

8197
05:31:40,500 --> 05:31:42,060
I got lucky

8198
05:31:42,060 --> 05:31:44,400
I got lucky for months early on I did

8199
05:31:44,400 --> 05:31:46,980
and then found out I didn't know

8200
05:31:46,980 --> 05:31:49,260
so would it make sense for someone that

8201
05:31:49,260 --> 05:31:51,780
has millions of dollars available and

8202
05:31:51,780 --> 05:31:52,798
you

8203
05:31:52,798 --> 05:31:55,200
customer deposits and they are over

8204
05:31:55,200 --> 05:31:57,060
leveraging that

8205
05:31:57,060 --> 05:32:00,260
30 to 1.

8206
05:32:00,298 --> 05:32:02,580
and they get right on an over leverage

8207
05:32:02,580 --> 05:32:04,798
position on a big fast runner 100

8208
05:32:04,798 --> 05:32:08,218
Handles in NQ you know 50 Handles in the

8209
05:32:08,218 --> 05:32:09,240
ES

8210
05:32:09,240 --> 05:32:11,160
come on man like you wouldn't take that

8211
05:32:11,160 --> 05:32:13,080
risk on either so you can't fault them

8212
05:32:13,080 --> 05:32:14,700
but it's just the reality of this

8213
05:32:14,700 --> 05:32:17,160
business it is what it is

8214
05:32:17,160 --> 05:32:18,840
but you don't need that first initial

8215
05:32:18,840 --> 05:32:21,240
search it's better for you to wait

8216
05:32:21,240 --> 05:32:23,878
and they paint all these scenarios with

8217
05:32:23,878 --> 05:32:26,100
the first initial run

8218
05:32:26,100 --> 05:32:27,780
oh it's going to keep going lower or

8219
05:32:27,780 --> 05:32:28,798
what's going oh it's going to keep going

8220
05:32:28,798 --> 05:32:31,680
higher so think about it like this at

8221
05:32:31,680 --> 05:32:33,060
two o'clock

8222
05:32:33,060 --> 05:32:35,218
we see gold

8223
05:32:35,218 --> 05:32:38,340
do this run here rips lower

8224
05:32:38,340 --> 05:32:40,320
remember this is the low I told you it

8225
05:32:40,320 --> 05:32:42,660
was going to go to did it go to it at

8226
05:32:42,660 --> 05:32:44,100
two o'clock

8227
05:32:44,100 --> 05:32:46,560
it's a 15 minute Candlestick by the way

8228
05:32:46,560 --> 05:32:49,500
it drops down but falls short of the

8229
05:32:49,500 --> 05:32:52,378
objective and then leaves this low in

8230
05:32:52,378 --> 05:32:54,718
this low as relative equal lows and then

8231
05:32:54,718 --> 05:32:57,920
it rips up higher

8232
05:32:58,440 --> 05:33:01,580
What's Happening Here

8233
05:33:02,100 --> 05:33:03,600
what's occurring

8234
05:33:03,600 --> 05:33:06,600
it's setting the stage for

8235
05:33:06,600 --> 05:33:08,580
traders that suspect that this is

8236
05:33:08,580 --> 05:33:10,740
support we can go long it's going to

8237
05:33:10,740 --> 05:33:12,980
Rally

8238
05:33:13,798 --> 05:33:15,740
that's not what we want to see

8239
05:33:15,740 --> 05:33:17,878
go into

8240
05:33:17,878 --> 05:33:20,218
the the expectation I'll teach you where

8241
05:33:20,218 --> 05:33:23,040
the FVG or the imbalance

8242
05:33:23,040 --> 05:33:25,980
it drops leaves this inefficiency right

8243
05:33:25,980 --> 05:33:28,160
here

8244
05:33:28,500 --> 05:33:31,378
when it drops it comes back up into it

8245
05:33:31,378 --> 05:33:32,400
there

8246
05:33:32,400 --> 05:33:34,798
to offer an opportunity to go short and

8247
05:33:34,798 --> 05:33:37,560
then it delivers where I sit on the 13th

8248
05:33:37,560 --> 05:33:39,060
which is that relative equal lows on the

8249
05:33:39,060 --> 05:33:42,180
daily chart it digs into it here

8250
05:33:42,180 --> 05:33:45,240
lower lower one more good time and then

8251
05:33:45,240 --> 05:33:48,120
rips higher today

8252
05:33:48,120 --> 05:33:50,280
all of this PA in here I I'm

8253
05:33:50,280 --> 05:33:52,080
telling you I would not be in any of

8254
05:33:52,080 --> 05:33:54,000
that

8255
05:33:54,000 --> 05:33:57,240
I didn't at all if I was looking at Gold

8256
05:33:57,240 --> 05:33:59,520
real time I would have told you that

8257
05:33:59,520 --> 05:34:01,080
it's possibly going to go here but I

8258
05:34:01,080 --> 05:34:02,160
wouldn't touch it and that's the honest

8259
05:34:02,160 --> 05:34:04,680
God truth I ask any of my long-term

8260
05:34:04,680 --> 05:34:06,958
students I say this all the time about

8261
05:34:06,958 --> 05:34:07,920
gold

8262
05:34:07,920 --> 05:34:09,360
I don't know what it is this fascination

8263
05:34:09,360 --> 05:34:11,340
with trading gold but there are better

8264
05:34:11,340 --> 05:34:13,680
markers to trade than this

8265
05:34:13,680 --> 05:34:16,920
but that two stage or a second stage of

8266
05:34:16,920 --> 05:34:21,298
delivery after 2 30. see the first move

8267
05:34:21,298 --> 05:34:24,360
is like a

8268
05:34:24,360 --> 05:34:26,760
a red herring hey pay attention over

8269
05:34:26,760 --> 05:34:29,340
here look at all this okay and then at 2

8270
05:34:29,340 --> 05:34:32,100
30 that's the real move

8271
05:34:32,100 --> 05:34:35,700
that's the real one okay so it can it

8272
05:34:35,700 --> 05:34:38,180
can come in two forms it can go

8273
05:34:38,180 --> 05:34:40,740
rally up suck everybody in thinking it's

8274
05:34:40,740 --> 05:34:43,080
going go lower and then wipes them

8275
05:34:43,080 --> 05:34:45,120
completely out and goes lower a lot

8276
05:34:45,120 --> 05:34:47,520
or it can drop lower

8277
05:34:47,520 --> 05:34:49,080
get everybody thinking at two o'clock

8278
05:34:49,080 --> 05:34:51,360
that it's going lower and then at 2 30

8279
05:34:51,360 --> 05:34:53,520
it rips and takes out the height it was

8280
05:34:53,520 --> 05:34:55,080
formed prior to drop

8281
05:34:55,080 --> 05:34:57,000
okay that's the buy or sell in that way

8282
05:34:57,000 --> 05:34:59,820
the other thing is where it drops down a

8283
05:34:59,820 --> 05:35:02,100
lot leaves a fair Bay Gap and at 2 30

8284
05:35:02,100 --> 05:35:04,200
it'll go back to the FVG

8285
05:35:04,200 --> 05:35:06,360
then the real run comes

8286
05:35:06,360 --> 05:35:09,840
most times most times it does not do

8287
05:35:09,840 --> 05:35:11,940
this

8288
05:35:11,940 --> 05:35:14,820
usually it creates a run One Direction

8289
05:35:14,820 --> 05:35:17,520
and that direction is a complete Judas

8290
05:35:17,520 --> 05:35:20,580
swing where it runs creates a high it

8291
05:35:20,580 --> 05:35:22,080
doesn't come back to that high and just

8292
05:35:22,080 --> 05:35:25,280
makes a lower low in the day

8293
05:35:27,060 --> 05:35:29,360
ES

8294
05:35:40,458 --> 05:35:43,860
two o'clock I know I've got people

8295
05:35:43,860 --> 05:35:45,420
sending me messages saying that the

8296
05:35:45,420 --> 05:35:46,760
title is wrong

8297
05:35:46,760 --> 05:35:51,540
I know it'll be changed I mislabeled my

8298
05:35:51,540 --> 05:35:54,540
notes Friday and everything since then I

8299
05:35:54,540 --> 05:35:55,920
mentioned that earlier in the recording

8300
05:35:55,920 --> 05:36:00,060
of the two o'clock is the initial leg

8301
05:36:00,060 --> 05:36:02,940
of FOMC

8302
05:36:02,940 --> 05:36:05,760
we dropped

8303
05:36:05,760 --> 05:36:09,120
rallied higher FVG

8304
05:36:09,120 --> 05:36:12,958
drops down rips up higher and then

8305
05:36:12,958 --> 05:36:15,298
one more time drops lower

8306
05:36:15,298 --> 05:36:17,700
if you look at the first move going into

8307
05:36:17,700 --> 05:36:19,740
a clock

8308
05:36:19,740 --> 05:36:22,378
what is the first move

8309
05:36:22,378 --> 05:36:24,718
it's dropping down

8310
05:36:24,718 --> 05:36:26,218
so it's setting what what's the

8311
05:36:26,218 --> 05:36:28,020
expectation what's retail going to think

8312
05:36:28,020 --> 05:36:29,280
it's going to keep doing

8313
05:36:29,280 --> 05:36:31,760
lower

8314
05:36:33,000 --> 05:36:37,500
this FVG is utilized twice

8315
05:36:37,500 --> 05:36:40,160
two times

8316
05:36:40,680 --> 05:36:43,798
trades into here rallies they dig into

8317
05:36:43,798 --> 05:36:46,860
it again today one more time and then

8318
05:36:46,860 --> 05:36:49,700
they send it higher

8319
05:36:50,340 --> 05:36:53,240
on NQ

8320
05:36:54,600 --> 05:36:56,100
this will be much more impactful because

8321
05:36:56,100 --> 05:36:58,500
I actually executed on it

8322
05:36:58,500 --> 05:37:01,520
it's all I'm sorry

8323
05:37:01,740 --> 05:37:04,500
all right so we have

8324
05:37:04,500 --> 05:37:07,080
yeah um we started where should yeah so

8325
05:37:07,080 --> 05:37:10,020
this is the NQ and I want to take

8326
05:37:10,020 --> 05:37:12,190
everything off this

8327
05:37:12,190 --> 05:37:13,440
[Music]

8328
05:37:13,440 --> 05:37:17,060
strip it down to nothing

8329
05:37:17,700 --> 05:37:18,780
all right

8330
05:37:18,780 --> 05:37:21,480
so here we have NQ NASDAQ delivery

8331
05:37:21,480 --> 05:37:23,760
contract month is September

8332
05:37:23,760 --> 05:37:26,600
2023

8333
05:37:33,120 --> 05:37:36,180
inside this drop

8334
05:37:36,180 --> 05:37:37,860
okay

8335
05:37:37,860 --> 05:37:39,480
think about what I've talked about here

8336
05:37:39,480 --> 05:37:40,860
think about what I've been talking about

8337
05:37:40,860 --> 05:37:44,760
for weeks in relationship to es even the

8338
05:37:44,760 --> 05:37:48,360
s p and the NASDAQ futures contract

8339
05:37:48,360 --> 05:37:51,120
which of those two has been the

8340
05:37:51,120 --> 05:37:53,040
leadership on the upside

8341
05:37:53,040 --> 05:37:54,900
which one has the strongest price

8342
05:37:54,900 --> 05:37:58,520
delivery for being bullish

8343
05:38:00,840 --> 05:38:03,958
and Q NASDAQ

8344
05:38:03,958 --> 05:38:05,940
so if we consider

8345
05:38:05,940 --> 05:38:08,400
trading FOMC doesn't it make more sense

8346
05:38:08,400 --> 05:38:10,560
if we want to go long why would we want

8347
05:38:10,560 --> 05:38:11,458
to go along

8348
05:38:11,458 --> 05:38:15,240
what was the move that took place on

8349
05:38:15,240 --> 05:38:17,638
the drop down into two o'clock it's

8350
05:38:17,638 --> 05:38:20,160
dropping at two o'clock

8351
05:38:20,160 --> 05:38:23,218
so here's your fake move

8352
05:38:23,218 --> 05:38:25,980
so this drop down here and then they

8353
05:38:25,980 --> 05:38:28,320
hold it here holding it holding holding

8354
05:38:28,320 --> 05:38:31,878
holding it and at 2 30

8355
05:38:31,920 --> 05:38:34,500
the macro begins

8356
05:38:34,500 --> 05:38:37,680
so when you're Trading FOMC

8357
05:38:37,680 --> 05:38:39,120
if you're not writing this down you're

8358
05:38:39,120 --> 05:38:42,138
completely wasting your time

8359
05:38:42,718 --> 05:38:45,060
you have to know which of the indices

8360
05:38:45,060 --> 05:38:46,440
that you're going to trade because of

8361
05:38:46,440 --> 05:38:48,000
relative strength which one's stronger

8362
05:38:48,000 --> 05:38:49,260
there's always going to be a leadership

8363
05:38:49,260 --> 05:38:52,280
issue whether it be NASDAQ or ES

8364
05:38:52,280 --> 05:38:57,958
Dao okay if it's Dao I just

8365
05:38:57,958 --> 05:38:59,878
go to ES

8366
05:38:59,878 --> 05:39:02,580
if it's NASDAQ I will trade NASDAQ over

8367
05:39:02,580 --> 05:39:04,500
ES

8368
05:39:04,500 --> 05:39:08,940
if it's anything leading to the weaker

8369
05:39:08,940 --> 05:39:11,940
or the stronger for the Dow

8370
05:39:11,940 --> 05:39:14,280
I always elect to use the Es as a

8371
05:39:14,280 --> 05:39:18,420
deferment I defer myself to trading only

8372
05:39:18,420 --> 05:39:22,200
yes not the the down

8373
05:39:22,200 --> 05:39:24,420
so if it's a matter of picking which

8374
05:39:24,420 --> 05:39:26,458
entity I'm trading it's either decision

8375
05:39:26,458 --> 05:39:28,860
of whether trading the NASDAQ and it has

8376
05:39:28,860 --> 05:39:30,240
to be the leadership on the upside that

8377
05:39:30,240 --> 05:39:32,940
means it's been going up longer Harder

8378
05:39:32,940 --> 05:39:36,240
Faster than ES

8379
05:39:36,240 --> 05:39:38,520
if es is going up longer Harder Faster

8380
05:39:38,520 --> 05:39:41,458
than NASDAQ if it was reversed in its

8381
05:39:41,458 --> 05:39:43,798
role I would have taken this trade in es

8382
05:39:43,798 --> 05:39:46,378
and not NASDAQ

8383
05:39:46,378 --> 05:39:49,378
so the first delivery at two o'clock was

8384
05:39:49,378 --> 05:39:51,600
seeing price do what drop down I want to

8385
05:39:51,600 --> 05:39:54,500
go into a five minute chart

8386
05:40:07,440 --> 05:40:09,420
when this Market dropped here what was

8387
05:40:09,420 --> 05:40:12,540
the where was the most energetic

8388
05:40:12,540 --> 05:40:16,400
price leg beginning from

8389
05:40:18,420 --> 05:40:19,620
here

8390
05:40:19,620 --> 05:40:21,900
at this big move here I'm not saying

8391
05:40:21,900 --> 05:40:24,000
that you can't see this one as a high or

8392
05:40:24,000 --> 05:40:26,040
this is a higher this is a high but this

8393
05:40:26,040 --> 05:40:27,900
is the most energetic so all of this

8394
05:40:27,900 --> 05:40:32,520
starts the Run going into FOMC

8395
05:40:32,520 --> 05:40:35,100
so anyone that's in this move wears

8396
05:40:35,100 --> 05:40:36,718
their stop loss

8397
05:40:36,718 --> 05:40:38,760
right about that short-term High

8398
05:40:38,760 --> 05:40:40,500
I'm aware

8399
05:40:40,500 --> 05:40:42,780
but remember I'm listening to this guy

8400
05:40:42,780 --> 05:40:45,120
tell me how to run my pool

8401
05:40:45,120 --> 05:40:47,340
and I'm not really paying attention to

8402
05:40:47,340 --> 05:40:49,680
him and I'm trying to get an example on

8403
05:40:49,680 --> 05:40:51,660
FOMC and I'm doing it with my phone

8404
05:40:51,660 --> 05:40:53,520
which is what you see on my Twitter feed

8405
05:40:53,520 --> 05:40:54,718
okay

8406
05:40:54,718 --> 05:40:57,660
tools playing in the background it's

8407
05:40:57,660 --> 05:41:00,480
what it is okay so

8408
05:41:00,480 --> 05:41:02,820
I think it's going to go up here but I

8409
05:41:02,820 --> 05:41:04,860
can't pretend to be listening to this

8410
05:41:04,860 --> 05:41:07,980
guy and watch all this watch all this

8411
05:41:07,980 --> 05:41:10,020
stuff happen as it's going on so I

8412
05:41:10,020 --> 05:41:12,298
picked a very easy target low hanging

8413
05:41:12,298 --> 05:41:13,620
fruit objective which is going to be the

8414
05:41:13,620 --> 05:41:15,298
buy stops resting Above This short-term

8415
05:41:15,298 --> 05:41:16,500
High

8416
05:41:16,500 --> 05:41:19,560
why was I going long in here what was I

8417
05:41:19,560 --> 05:41:21,920
looking at

8418
05:41:28,920 --> 05:41:31,680
this move here

8419
05:41:31,680 --> 05:41:34,680
I'm sorry this movie this down closed

8420
05:41:34,680 --> 05:41:35,760
candle here

8421
05:41:35,760 --> 05:41:37,680
all of this movement in here back and

8422
05:41:37,680 --> 05:41:38,878
forth

8423
05:41:38,878 --> 05:41:40,860
I'm treating that as like a very small

8424
05:41:40,860 --> 05:41:42,420
little bounce price range it's going

8425
05:41:42,420 --> 05:41:45,060
back and forth back and forth so I'm

8426
05:41:45,060 --> 05:41:47,700
trusting that there shouldn't be any

8427
05:41:47,700 --> 05:41:50,458
more meaningful run below that if we

8428
05:41:50,458 --> 05:41:52,500
take out that candle's High

8429
05:41:52,500 --> 05:41:53,940
we have it here

8430
05:41:53,940 --> 05:41:56,400
so we take it out High

8431
05:41:56,400 --> 05:41:58,378
that low now becomes that's it there's

8432
05:41:58,378 --> 05:42:00,000
no more need for any more risk going

8433
05:42:00,000 --> 05:42:02,760
lower the the stage is set because what

8434
05:42:02,760 --> 05:42:04,020
time is it

8435
05:42:04,020 --> 05:42:05,520
225

8436
05:42:05,520 --> 05:42:08,520
the first stage of that delivery in the

8437
05:42:08,520 --> 05:42:10,260
strongest of all the indices which is

8438
05:42:10,260 --> 05:42:12,480
the NASDAQ

8439
05:42:12,480 --> 05:42:15,240
I'm not looking at or caring about es

8440
05:42:15,240 --> 05:42:17,940
I'm not looking or caring about the Dow

8441
05:42:17,940 --> 05:42:20,100
I'm not looking at relationships between

8442
05:42:20,100 --> 05:42:22,440
the smt I don't care about that

8443
05:42:22,440 --> 05:42:24,540
it's time

8444
05:42:24,540 --> 05:42:27,180
the macro will run on time it's going to

8445
05:42:27,180 --> 05:42:28,740
favor

8446
05:42:28,740 --> 05:42:30,298
this Market because it's been

8447
05:42:30,298 --> 05:42:33,298
outperformed on the upside so it's

8448
05:42:33,298 --> 05:42:36,120
its sponsorship is heavily on this one

8449
05:42:36,120 --> 05:42:38,280
going up versus the es like it's been

8450
05:42:38,280 --> 05:42:39,600
doing for weeks

8451
05:42:39,600 --> 05:42:41,458
and the Dow has already proven it's

8452
05:42:41,458 --> 05:42:42,600
lethargic

8453
05:42:42,600 --> 05:42:44,458
it's not interested in performing like

8454
05:42:44,458 --> 05:42:47,940
the es and or not even close to NASDAQ

8455
05:42:47,940 --> 05:42:51,180
so all Focus would be on NASDAQ

8456
05:42:51,180 --> 05:42:52,680
so

8457
05:42:52,680 --> 05:42:55,260
buying going long

8458
05:42:55,260 --> 05:42:58,798
right here what am I keying off of

8459
05:42:58,798 --> 05:43:00,958
look at the arrow where I entered

8460
05:43:00,958 --> 05:43:04,340
and what I've already told you

8461
05:43:09,600 --> 05:43:11,760
this body of this candle the last down

8462
05:43:11,760 --> 05:43:13,020
closed candle

8463
05:43:13,020 --> 05:43:15,900
I'm using as Bella by the way

8464
05:43:15,900 --> 05:43:18,660
this movement down into here

8465
05:43:18,660 --> 05:43:22,620
I'm buying that right there right there

8466
05:43:22,620 --> 05:43:26,040
bought that then I'm using this right

8467
05:43:26,040 --> 05:43:27,958
here this opening price and inside this

8468
05:43:27,958 --> 05:43:30,120
little area here I want to use that as a

8469
05:43:30,120 --> 05:43:32,280
means of wanting to go long on a pyramid

8470
05:43:32,280 --> 05:43:34,320
so I went along with five contracts

8471
05:43:34,320 --> 05:43:36,480
which is not a lot

8472
05:43:36,480 --> 05:43:38,160
and I added another one which is I'm

8473
05:43:38,160 --> 05:43:40,940
pilloring

8474
05:43:42,540 --> 05:43:45,000
what am I aiming for here

8475
05:43:45,000 --> 05:43:47,878
just before we get to this High because

8476
05:43:47,878 --> 05:43:51,180
during FOMC it could do this wild whip

8477
05:43:51,180 --> 05:43:53,458
saw still and then deliver up I want to

8478
05:43:53,458 --> 05:43:55,558
get in or I'm sorry I want to get out of

8479
05:43:55,558 --> 05:43:58,080
my trade as it approaches this high low

8480
05:43:58,080 --> 05:44:00,240
hanging fruit I don't need it to go to

8481
05:44:00,240 --> 05:44:04,160
the high or higher to get a fill

8482
05:44:05,638 --> 05:44:08,940
there's my exit on this candle here all

8483
05:44:08,940 --> 05:44:12,920
this rundown is completely wiped out

8484
05:44:13,500 --> 05:44:16,638
ultimately taking out

8485
05:44:16,680 --> 05:44:19,378
that high here

8486
05:44:19,378 --> 05:44:21,980
over here

8487
05:44:22,558 --> 05:44:23,958
two stages

8488
05:44:23,958 --> 05:44:26,700
NFP is the same way

8489
05:44:26,700 --> 05:44:29,218
it either gives you a drop

8490
05:44:29,218 --> 05:44:30,958
come back to a fair bag Gap and continue

8491
05:44:30,958 --> 05:44:33,840
or it gives you a drop and completely

8492
05:44:33,840 --> 05:44:36,718
reverse and rip higher everything

8493
05:44:36,718 --> 05:44:39,240
reversed

8494
05:44:39,240 --> 05:44:41,280
the difference in knowing which one it

8495
05:44:41,280 --> 05:44:44,040
is is how it trades at the time which is

8496
05:44:44,040 --> 05:44:46,138
why I have to wait I have to see what

8497
05:44:46,138 --> 05:44:47,580
it's doing

8498
05:44:47,580 --> 05:44:51,660
how it delivers and compare it to the

8499
05:44:51,660 --> 05:44:53,340
other averages

8500
05:44:53,340 --> 05:44:55,080
that's what I'm looking for I'm looking

8501
05:44:55,080 --> 05:44:56,520
for that relationship between the other

8502
05:44:56,520 --> 05:45:00,120
it's not smt I'm looking at how who's

8503
05:45:00,120 --> 05:45:02,400
been leading the pack higher or lower

8504
05:45:02,400 --> 05:45:04,620
whenever these reports come out

8505
05:45:04,620 --> 05:45:05,878
and then I'm looking for where the

8506
05:45:05,878 --> 05:45:08,400
liquidity is

8507
05:45:08,400 --> 05:45:10,440
traders that were trying to chase this

8508
05:45:10,440 --> 05:45:12,480
they're trapped down here

8509
05:45:12,480 --> 05:45:15,740
they're hoping it's going to go lower

8510
05:45:16,378 --> 05:45:18,000
back up it goes

8511
05:45:18,000 --> 05:45:20,760
go back and look at your calendar

8512
05:45:20,760 --> 05:45:23,520
and every time there was a FOMC radio

8513
05:45:23,520 --> 05:45:26,458
announcement and NFP study

8514
05:45:26,458 --> 05:45:29,040
how that liquidity is taken

8515
05:45:29,040 --> 05:45:33,058
study that it's always a two-stage macro

8516
05:45:33,058 --> 05:45:35,760
it always does something initially

8517
05:45:35,760 --> 05:45:37,860
that gets people thinking it's going to

8518
05:45:37,860 --> 05:45:40,440
do something specific and then it rips

8519
05:45:40,440 --> 05:45:42,020
their face off

8520
05:45:42,020 --> 05:45:47,100
CPI is that macro on steroids

8521
05:45:47,100 --> 05:45:50,700
on crack on meth okay it's it's

8522
05:45:50,700 --> 05:45:53,400
literally like cocained up

8523
05:45:53,400 --> 05:45:55,320
the same macro

8524
05:45:55,320 --> 05:45:58,200
and you can't trade that

8525
05:45:58,200 --> 05:46:03,120
you can't okay you can't so

8526
05:46:03,240 --> 05:46:05,638
all these high impact news drivers and

8527
05:46:05,638 --> 05:46:07,320
or medium impact news drivers if you're

8528
05:46:07,320 --> 05:46:08,580
afraid of those

8529
05:46:08,580 --> 05:46:12,000
just wait 30 minutes minimum make wait

8530
05:46:12,000 --> 05:46:14,520
30 minutes after they form and then see

8531
05:46:14,520 --> 05:46:16,320
what liquidity resides in the

8532
05:46:16,320 --> 05:46:19,138
marketplace still in any inefficiency

8533
05:46:19,138 --> 05:46:21,240
and if it offers you a range that

8534
05:46:21,240 --> 05:46:22,980
presents

8535
05:46:22,980 --> 05:46:26,638
potential to see 10 handles then you

8536
05:46:26,638 --> 05:46:28,260
probably have a good chance of making

8537
05:46:28,260 --> 05:46:29,760
five out of it

8538
05:46:29,760 --> 05:46:34,200
or maybe even more so it's a there's a

8539
05:46:34,200 --> 05:46:36,420
lot of

8540
05:46:36,420 --> 05:46:38,760
waiting around to see what happens on

8541
05:46:38,760 --> 05:46:41,160
these big impact news drivers because

8542
05:46:41,160 --> 05:46:43,440
you don't know and I don't know before

8543
05:46:43,440 --> 05:46:45,600
it happens how they're going to use that

8544
05:46:45,600 --> 05:46:47,700
information to manipulate it

8545
05:46:47,700 --> 05:46:50,400
because they want people chasing this

8546
05:46:50,400 --> 05:46:52,200
idea at the moment

8547
05:46:52,200 --> 05:46:54,420
and they know that Brokers are pulling

8548
05:46:54,420 --> 05:46:55,440
liquidity

8549
05:46:55,440 --> 05:46:57,600
not that there is an absence of trading

8550
05:46:57,600 --> 05:46:59,400
or interest it just means that all the

8551
05:46:59,400 --> 05:47:01,200
Brokers are collectively saying the hell

8552
05:47:01,200 --> 05:47:02,700
with this we are not getting caught on

8553
05:47:02,700 --> 05:47:03,958
the wrong side

8554
05:47:03,958 --> 05:47:05,520
because

8555
05:47:05,520 --> 05:47:08,160
if they get a client or a large base of

8556
05:47:08,160 --> 05:47:10,500
their clients that are over leveraging

8557
05:47:10,500 --> 05:47:12,718
and everybody predominantly over

8558
05:47:12,718 --> 05:47:16,500
leverages you know you do it too

8559
05:47:16,500 --> 05:47:18,360
what happens if they're right on a big

8560
05:47:18,360 --> 05:47:20,100
move day

8561
05:47:20,100 --> 05:47:21,900
the Brokers are out

8562
05:47:21,900 --> 05:47:25,440
they're not trying to do that so

8563
05:47:25,440 --> 05:47:28,378
wait wait for that initial shock and

8564
05:47:28,378 --> 05:47:30,058
Trust the fact that you don't need that

8565
05:47:30,058 --> 05:47:32,218
first move to make money you don't need

8566
05:47:32,218 --> 05:47:33,120
it

8567
05:47:33,120 --> 05:47:36,240
wait for the the first move in two

8568
05:47:36,240 --> 05:47:39,120
o'clock at FOMC and then

8569
05:47:39,120 --> 05:47:40,638
225

8570
05:47:40,638 --> 05:47:43,558
230 then it's going to rip the other

8571
05:47:43,558 --> 05:47:45,000
direction

8572
05:47:45,000 --> 05:47:46,980
that's that's what it is that's exactly

8573
05:47:46,980 --> 05:47:50,638
what happens it's kind of like

8574
05:47:50,638 --> 05:47:51,958
well I don't want to say it in the live

8575
05:47:51,958 --> 05:47:54,058
stream because I think my channel might

8576
05:47:54,058 --> 05:47:55,798
get flagged but I've said the analogy

8577
05:47:55,798 --> 05:47:57,600
before on Twitter and stuff and I'll

8578
05:47:57,600 --> 05:47:59,820
talk about it this weekend in a shotgun

8579
05:47:59,820 --> 05:48:02,160
Saturday I'm sure you're all wondering

8580
05:48:02,160 --> 05:48:03,420
what it is it's not a big deal it's just

8581
05:48:03,420 --> 05:48:05,280
it's a analogy I use

8582
05:48:05,280 --> 05:48:07,680
that has something to do with making

8583
05:48:07,680 --> 05:48:09,660
individuals run to a specific area and

8584
05:48:09,660 --> 05:48:11,580
then attacking that once they get there

8585
05:48:11,580 --> 05:48:14,660
for a larger impactful you know event

8586
05:48:14,660 --> 05:48:16,920
that's that's what I mean by two stage

8587
05:48:16,920 --> 05:48:20,878
so it's designed to Corral Traders into

8588
05:48:20,878 --> 05:48:22,558
one big area

8589
05:48:22,558 --> 05:48:24,120
make them think it's going to do a

8590
05:48:24,120 --> 05:48:25,860
specific thing so that way there is a

8591
05:48:25,860 --> 05:48:27,480
pool of liquidity that's being

8592
05:48:27,480 --> 05:48:30,718
sacrificed and then that liquidity is

8593
05:48:30,718 --> 05:48:33,058
being used for a counterparty so it's

8594
05:48:33,058 --> 05:48:35,040
tricking traders to go in the wrong

8595
05:48:35,040 --> 05:48:36,780
direction and then breaking them across

8596
05:48:36,780 --> 05:48:39,620
the coals the other direction

8597
05:48:41,458 --> 05:48:44,100
that is going to be it for today we went

8598
05:48:44,100 --> 05:48:46,320
through my entire hit list of everything

8599
05:48:46,320 --> 05:48:49,520
and I was a little bit short on my time

8600
05:48:49,520 --> 05:48:52,620
two o'clock that's pretty good isn't it

8601
05:48:52,620 --> 05:48:54,360
you got some

8602
05:48:54,360 --> 05:48:56,820
got some value today

8603
05:48:56,820 --> 05:48:58,980
I talked about a lot of things that

8604
05:48:58,980 --> 05:49:01,440
hopefully will amplify

8605
05:49:01,440 --> 05:49:03,900
some of the misunderstandings or or

8606
05:49:03,900 --> 05:49:06,660
shortcomings in terms of your learning

8607
05:49:06,660 --> 05:49:10,260
and I amplify the own things that I know

8608
05:49:10,260 --> 05:49:12,718
I get a lot of requests for Breakaway

8609
05:49:12,718 --> 05:49:15,420
gaps and introduced more insight about a

8610
05:49:15,420 --> 05:49:17,360
balanced price range

8611
05:49:17,360 --> 05:49:19,580
and

8612
05:49:19,580 --> 05:49:22,620
preached that we focus on understanding

8613
05:49:22,620 --> 05:49:25,020
which one is the leadership and when

8614
05:49:25,020 --> 05:49:26,520
does it matter when does it really

8615
05:49:26,520 --> 05:49:28,558
matter to be in the the one that's a

8616
05:49:28,558 --> 05:49:30,540
leadership because you see ICT trading

8617
05:49:30,540 --> 05:49:32,340
the yes

8618
05:49:32,340 --> 05:49:34,740
even though I told you NASDAQ weeks ago

8619
05:49:34,740 --> 05:49:36,780
was a strong one so why aren't you

8620
05:49:36,780 --> 05:49:38,700
trading that one because I'm teaching

8621
05:49:38,700 --> 05:49:41,160
you how you can still find profitability

8622
05:49:41,160 --> 05:49:44,160
if you did it wrong if you found

8623
05:49:44,160 --> 05:49:45,360
something

8624
05:49:45,360 --> 05:49:49,440
as a setup and you didn't confer with

8625
05:49:49,440 --> 05:49:51,180
the relationships between the averages

8626
05:49:51,180 --> 05:49:54,240
okay or if you're a Forex repair Trader

8627
05:49:54,240 --> 05:49:56,458
you didn't do the relationships between

8628
05:49:56,458 --> 05:49:58,740
which is stronger the British pound

8629
05:49:58,740 --> 05:50:01,260
versus the US dollar or the euro versus

8630
05:50:01,260 --> 05:50:02,638
the US dollar

8631
05:50:02,638 --> 05:50:04,500
you want to be in the stronger one if

8632
05:50:04,500 --> 05:50:05,700
you're going long you want to be in the

8633
05:50:05,700 --> 05:50:07,440
weaker one if you're going short

8634
05:50:07,440 --> 05:50:10,558
well when it matters most is when we

8635
05:50:10,558 --> 05:50:12,058
have these high impact news drivers

8636
05:50:12,058 --> 05:50:14,280
because they're going to really

8637
05:50:14,280 --> 05:50:17,638
capitalize in Wind these markets out

8638
05:50:17,638 --> 05:50:20,458
when they are the leadership issue look

8639
05:50:20,458 --> 05:50:23,458
at the relationship between

8640
05:50:23,458 --> 05:50:25,138
the NASDAQ here

8641
05:50:25,138 --> 05:50:27,860
in es

8642
05:50:33,840 --> 05:50:36,240
you see it right away don't you

8643
05:50:36,240 --> 05:50:39,420
it was not able to climb as high look

8644
05:50:39,420 --> 05:50:43,138
look at here here to here okay

8645
05:50:43,138 --> 05:50:45,480
I'm going to take you back to the NASDAQ

8646
05:50:45,480 --> 05:50:48,660
see that higher that's why ICT was

8647
05:50:48,660 --> 05:50:51,058
buying this one and not ES

8648
05:50:51,058 --> 05:50:54,958
and you know funded account

8649
05:50:54,958 --> 05:50:57,540
traders that have you found their way

8650
05:50:57,540 --> 05:50:59,878
into

8651
05:50:59,878 --> 05:51:01,558
I guess the part where they can make

8652
05:51:01,558 --> 05:51:02,878
money and then take the money that

8653
05:51:02,878 --> 05:51:05,638
people pay in and call themselves you

8654
05:51:05,638 --> 05:51:08,218
know paid out whatever that is a trade

8655
05:51:08,218 --> 05:51:09,660
right here that they could do

8656
05:51:09,660 --> 05:51:13,020
it's not the maximum number of contracts

8657
05:51:13,020 --> 05:51:14,580
available that they can trade it's less

8658
05:51:14,580 --> 05:51:16,920
than and that run right there is

8659
05:51:16,920 --> 05:51:18,480
equivalent to twenty three thousand

8660
05:51:18,480 --> 05:51:19,920
dollars

8661
05:51:19,920 --> 05:51:24,000
so you you tell me is it worth the

8662
05:51:24,000 --> 05:51:25,860
gamble of trying to guess before the

8663
05:51:25,860 --> 05:51:27,120
fact

8664
05:51:27,120 --> 05:51:29,458
or waiting for the initial

8665
05:51:29,458 --> 05:51:30,480
you

8666
05:51:30,480 --> 05:51:32,940
impact crater to form and then you go

8667
05:51:32,940 --> 05:51:35,400
over there and find the people that you

8668
05:51:35,400 --> 05:51:37,680
can pick the pockets of that you know

8669
05:51:37,680 --> 05:51:39,240
they're dead already you don't know it

8670
05:51:39,240 --> 05:51:40,860
and you go there and you take their

8671
05:51:40,860 --> 05:51:44,218
money from their accounts and get out

8672
05:51:44,218 --> 05:51:45,840
and walk away

8673
05:51:45,840 --> 05:51:48,120
I'll leave you with the idea of that

8674
05:51:48,120 --> 05:51:50,400
being a good analysis or not but I'm

8675
05:51:50,400 --> 05:51:52,200
usually the action guy that you know

8676
05:51:52,200 --> 05:51:54,058
sees things from a Rambo perspective

8677
05:51:54,058 --> 05:51:56,100
that's just the way I look at things but

8678
05:51:56,100 --> 05:51:57,600
the if you want to look at it as

8679
05:51:57,600 --> 05:52:00,420
ballerinas dancing around yeah whatever

8680
05:52:00,420 --> 05:52:02,458
whoever whatever whatever suits you that

8681
05:52:02,458 --> 05:52:03,840
helps you understand you know what the

8682
05:52:03,840 --> 05:52:06,000
Market's doing it's wonderful but

8683
05:52:06,000 --> 05:52:08,520
yeah my audience predominantly is male

8684
05:52:08,520 --> 05:52:11,638
so and I'm a guy so I I kind of like

8685
05:52:11,638 --> 05:52:13,378
lean to that

8686
05:52:13,378 --> 05:52:14,940
but one more time you can see the

8687
05:52:14,940 --> 05:52:17,760
difference between the two

8688
05:52:17,760 --> 05:52:20,760
much much weaker on ES

8689
05:52:20,760 --> 05:52:22,260
okay

8690
05:52:22,260 --> 05:52:25,218
so it's two o'clock

8691
05:52:25,218 --> 05:52:28,680
and my stomach is growling

8692
05:52:28,680 --> 05:52:30,780
so the only thing I had today was bone

8693
05:52:30,780 --> 05:52:33,240
broth so

8694
05:52:33,240 --> 05:52:36,138
I'm somewhat hungry

8695
05:52:37,320 --> 05:52:38,580
I'm trying to think if there's anything

8696
05:52:38,580 --> 05:52:40,138
else I want to add before we close it

8697
05:52:40,138 --> 05:52:41,878
and I don't believe I do have anything

8698
05:52:41,878 --> 05:52:45,240
else in addition to what we've done here

8699
05:52:45,240 --> 05:52:46,860
real quick I just want to show you the

8700
05:52:46,860 --> 05:52:49,040
down

8701
05:52:51,180 --> 05:52:55,980
okay so we have a drop the Fairway Gap

8702
05:52:55,980 --> 05:52:58,260
it trades into here and they reclaim it

8703
05:52:58,260 --> 05:53:00,540
there today and then they sent it higher

8704
05:53:00,540 --> 05:53:02,218
so it's a little bit of a delay to take

8705
05:53:02,218 --> 05:53:04,138
out the relative equal highs we

8706
05:53:04,138 --> 05:53:05,760
mentioned this high

8707
05:53:05,760 --> 05:53:08,940
on the 13th of June and that's where it

8708
05:53:08,940 --> 05:53:11,878
hit it and just retraced lower and now

8709
05:53:11,878 --> 05:53:13,980
we're climbing above it here I'm not

8710
05:53:13,980 --> 05:53:16,138
really excited about the Dow still um if

8711
05:53:16,138 --> 05:53:18,298
even I was willing to trade it I still

8712
05:53:18,298 --> 05:53:19,500
wouldn't be interested in trading where

8713
05:53:19,500 --> 05:53:21,360
it's at you might be thinking well

8714
05:53:21,360 --> 05:53:23,340
wouldn't six sister apply to that

8715
05:53:23,340 --> 05:53:25,200
because it has a lot of ground to gain

8716
05:53:25,200 --> 05:53:27,920
to try to catch up with

8717
05:53:27,920 --> 05:53:30,200
NASDAQ or even es

8718
05:53:30,200 --> 05:53:34,320
maybe I just don't trade down it's it's

8719
05:53:34,320 --> 05:53:37,680
a a real spotty index and it's only 30

8720
05:53:37,680 --> 05:53:39,480
stocks that make it up so it's very

8721
05:53:39,480 --> 05:53:41,100
easily

8722
05:53:41,100 --> 05:53:43,558
manipulated okay and I want to say it in

8723
05:53:43,558 --> 05:53:44,820
the same way like I mentioned but gold

8724
05:53:44,820 --> 05:53:46,138
because it's nowhere near the degree of

8725
05:53:46,138 --> 05:53:48,320
manipulation and endowed that is in Gold

8726
05:53:48,320 --> 05:53:52,200
but Dow is very thin okay meaning there

8727
05:53:52,200 --> 05:53:53,760
isn't a lot of trading that takes place

8728
05:53:53,760 --> 05:53:57,058
in it versus the es in the NASDAQ and

8729
05:53:57,058 --> 05:53:59,520
NASDAQ is a fast Market because it's

8730
05:53:59,520 --> 05:54:02,520
thinner too so that's really what makes

8731
05:54:02,520 --> 05:54:04,620
the the es a little bit slower but

8732
05:54:04,620 --> 05:54:05,820
sometimes there's a little bit of a

8733
05:54:05,820 --> 05:54:09,000
inversion where es will outperformed the

8734
05:54:09,000 --> 05:54:11,940
NASDAQ but most of the time the

8735
05:54:11,940 --> 05:54:13,500
NASDAQ acts like the British pound

8736
05:54:13,500 --> 05:54:17,878
versus the Euro okay es will be

8737
05:54:17,878 --> 05:54:20,820
equivalent to like a Euro and NASDAQ is

8738
05:54:20,820 --> 05:54:22,020
equivalent to how

8739
05:54:22,020 --> 05:54:24,440
British penetrates British pound always

8740
05:54:24,440 --> 05:54:27,120
exaggerates the move that would be seen

8741
05:54:27,120 --> 05:54:28,740
in Europe which is why I always

8742
05:54:28,740 --> 05:54:30,240
predominantly like to trade the cable

8743
05:54:30,240 --> 05:54:32,340
which is pound dollar but there are

8744
05:54:32,340 --> 05:54:33,900
times when euro dollar will outperform

8745
05:54:33,900 --> 05:54:36,420
cable and you have to know the things

8746
05:54:36,420 --> 05:54:39,000
I'm teaching here the relationships of

8747
05:54:39,000 --> 05:54:41,218
measuring when to look at it and when

8748
05:54:41,218 --> 05:54:43,798
not to consider it and you can't learn

8749
05:54:43,798 --> 05:54:45,780
that in just one video you have to see

8750
05:54:45,780 --> 05:54:48,900
it experience it see analysis see things

8751
05:54:48,900 --> 05:54:51,360
called in advance watch how it performs

8752
05:54:51,360 --> 05:54:53,878
also back test all those things should

8753
05:54:53,878 --> 05:54:55,378
be included when you're looking at Price

8754
05:54:55,378 --> 05:54:59,280
moves like when you're looking at Forex

8755
05:54:59,280 --> 05:55:02,160
price runs and you're logging them for

8756
05:55:02,160 --> 05:55:04,558
your Journal you want to be looking at

8757
05:55:04,558 --> 05:55:07,680
other closely correlated pairs not just

8758
05:55:07,680 --> 05:55:09,540
the one that you see the setup in so

8759
05:55:09,540 --> 05:55:11,878
that way you're getting a a real clear

8760
05:55:11,878 --> 05:55:13,558
depiction of what everything else around

8761
05:55:13,558 --> 05:55:15,900
that pair was dealing at the same time

8762
05:55:15,900 --> 05:55:17,700
so that way it's not this in and of

8763
05:55:17,700 --> 05:55:20,340
itself an island of itself saying I'm

8764
05:55:20,340 --> 05:55:21,958
doing whatever I want to do no it's

8765
05:55:21,958 --> 05:55:24,660
being subordinate to the macro that's

8766
05:55:24,660 --> 05:55:28,980
under underway in all the markets so

8767
05:55:28,980 --> 05:55:30,420
anyway

8768
05:55:30,420 --> 05:55:32,160
I think I've given you enough today to

8769
05:55:32,160 --> 05:55:33,540
give myself a day off and a three-day

8770
05:55:33,540 --> 05:55:35,280
weekend and I understand yes it's not

8771
05:55:35,280 --> 05:55:36,900
Friday so I'll be changing the title of

8772
05:55:36,900 --> 05:55:38,280
this

8773
05:55:38,280 --> 05:55:41,340
and I will catch up with you I'm sure

8774
05:55:41,340 --> 05:55:43,740
somewhere on Twitter I don't know but if

8775
05:55:43,740 --> 05:55:45,240
I don't talk to you tomorrow on on

8776
05:55:45,240 --> 05:55:47,040
Twitter I will talk to you

8777
05:55:47,040 --> 05:55:49,500
Saturday morning at nine o'clock for a

8778
05:55:49,500 --> 05:55:52,620
Saturday shotgun with ICT

8779
05:55:52,620 --> 05:55:54,600
so I'll talk to you next time

8780
05:55:54,600 --> 05:55:57,200
be safe
