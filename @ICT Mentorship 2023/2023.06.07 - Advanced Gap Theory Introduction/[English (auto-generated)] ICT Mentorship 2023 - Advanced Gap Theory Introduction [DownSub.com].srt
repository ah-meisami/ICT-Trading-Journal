1
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm good evening folks welcome back

2
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,199
well I was supposed to be doing a live

3
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,420
stream today but uh I guess the powers

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,759
that be

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,600
that uh

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,820
was unfortunate that I couldn't do it

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,219
today uh OBS wouldn't connect to my

8
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,600
YouTube channel

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,579
and I had all kinds of issues with it so

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,520
I elected to sit down and wait for the

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,020
close of the day and then come back in

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,399
here and do somewhat a little bit of a

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,440
review but also I want to teach a little

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,760
bit more about institutional overflow

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,940
Advanced ICT Gap Theory

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,219
so we're looking at the dollar Index

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,260
this is a weekly chart to just keep you

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,940
abreast as to where we are in that

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,100
Weekly range

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,799
reach it up into the weekly bearish

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,240
order block which is this candle right

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,320
here

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,360
which is the midpoint of that

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,060
pierced that last week so far this week

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,100
we're just Meandering around inside of

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,439
the range of the weekly order block

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,880
opening price

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,040
in that mean threshold

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,020
daily chart here

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,280
you can see

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,020
Fair shorter block again

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,439
working that level a few times more

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,600
over the last few days

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,320
we have a small little Fairway Gap there

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,140
and we trade it back down into the old

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,780
weekly inversion fair value Gap

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,939
and again

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,220
assume for a moment that

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
we move higher okay unless we break

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,960
below this low here I'm going to stay

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,460
with that narrative

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,979
and if it does we'll be looking for buy

43
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,180
side here

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,920
and then we have a

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,579
volume and balance there

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,860
and we have a

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,560
Wick so a consequent encouragement that

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,459
I don't have it on here because I don't

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,020
have too many lines

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,180
but I have that level in mind should we

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,879
go about this high midpoint of this Wick

52
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,400
and then the volume and balance

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,940
okay

54
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,739
that's also uh

55
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,560
the premium Wick console encouragement

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
on the weekly chart let's go back up one

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
more time

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,620
that's this one here okay

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,239
all right so let's move down into

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,819
an hourly chart for dollar Index usually

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,620
I don't do this with you but

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,940
we'll go into a little bit more detail

63
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,959
here

64
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,000
so inside this swing low

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,540
all this price action this is a

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,360
swing on a larger daily chart that we're

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,879
looking at through the lens of an hourly

68
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,340
chart see this Gap right here

69
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,379
notice there's an absence of one over

70
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,879
here but look at all the back and forth

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
price action so we have only sell side

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
here offered so that means the candle

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
went through between this candles low

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,239
and this candle is high it delivered on

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,720
the downside so it's sell side delivery

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,239
inefficient in the form of buy side

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,640
delivery so it's offered here on this

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
candle

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,099
to the next candle we open trade down

80
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,540
rally back up

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,720
and close right here next candle opens

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,500
trades down stops right inside that Gap

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,580
low

84
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,640
then sends it higher

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,459
this is a balanced price range

86
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,680
balanced price ranges

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,580
tend to either stop at their high or low

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,180
or midpoint or well she'll be consequent

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,700
encouragement midpoint of the gap

90
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,200
we can see that happening essentially

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,180
here

92
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,819
so this extended through and again this

93
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,379
is the reason why it's not supply and

94
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,360
demand folks we cut through candles to

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
get to a narrative

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
the algorithm is going right back to

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,220
this inefficiency

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,840
and the fact that we traded back and

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,760
forth here

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,880
by side sell side has been offered

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,660
it left that range right here

102
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,300
if it ever comes back down into it it's

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,479
highly unlikely that we'll trade to the

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,900
low of this Gap again and through it

105
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,060
so that's what makes a ICT balance price

106
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,320
range

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,259
we also have a imbalance here I wanted

108
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,080
to make sure I highlighted this Gap

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,540
but this candle is low and this candle

110
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,380
is high

111
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,020
that would be typically the Shaded area

112
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,580
here so don't be confused I'm not

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,740
drawing it to here to make up the 60

114
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,180
Minute Affair that you got which is in

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,440
the form of a buy side imbalance cell

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,139
certain efficiency so only by side was

117
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,900
offered Here Sell side was offered to it

118
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
there and then quickly after hitting the

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,160
balance price range consequent

120
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,620
encroachment price immediately erupted

121
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,800
to the upside working up into this very

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,380
magnet in the form of a city still sound

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,120
about to buy something efficiency

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,620
notice how many times it hits that daily

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,080
bearish order block here it's worked the

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,919
level here here and here

127
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,280
and that mean threshold weekly bear

128
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,100
shorter block here at 104.54

129
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,280
that also has a small little bit of a

130
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,039
inefficiency still remaining here so we

131
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,840
got as high as that candle here but

132
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
between this candle's high that candle

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,380
is low there's a small little Gap in

134
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,400
there

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,539
so

136
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,820
if you look at the high and the low and

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,620
the higher high here this down close

138
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,979
candle extend that through that's a ICT

139
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,380
bearish breaker so you can see it being

140
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,800
respected here respected here here and

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
even here

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,539
so it would be much more meaningful to

143
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,500
me

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,060
if we were to break that

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,139
low here otherwise I'm going to stick

146
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,000
with the likelihood that dollar Index

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,620
will either consolidate

148
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,800
or go higher either one

149
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
you know I could care less right now I'm

150
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,340
still neutral and I'll explain more

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,280
about that as we go

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,020
here's euro dollar this is its weekly

153
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,919
chart

154
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,880
and

155
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
all of this price action back and forth

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,460
in here

157
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,080
even at their sell side liquidity

158
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,660
resting below this

159
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,800
it's

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,740
being met with high resistance

161
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,100
so high resistance liquidity runs they

162
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,180
can still deliver and go below here but

163
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,759
High Resistance recording runs are very

164
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
frustrating sometimes for individuals

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
that don't know how to anticipate them

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,039
or

167
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,340
don't know what they are so I teach you

168
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,160
in my Concepts to identify what a high

169
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,560
resistance liquidity run is so that way

170
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,940
you can understand the distinctions

171
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,520
between that and a low resistance

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
liquidity run low resistance recording

173
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,720
runs

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,060
are high probability and they are

175
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
immediate gratification that this

176
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,259
immediately run to your objectives it's

177
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,940
very fun to trade them

178
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,039
it's almost immediate feedback once you

179
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,139
get into the trade whereas a high

180
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,759
resistance liquidity run

181
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,740
is a trade that's met with a lot of

182
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,020
resistance in getting to where your

183
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,960
objective may be now because I'm calling

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,660
it a high resistance or low resistance

185
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,940
doesn't mean that it's resistance in the

186
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,240
sense of support or resistance

187
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,699
from the perspective of a retail Theory

188
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,780
it's resistance in the form that it's

189
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,479
very hard for it to be one-way delivery

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,940
so it's going to be a lot of

191
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,139
consolidation move a little bit come

192
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,240
back retrace much more than you're

193
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
probably comfortable and then

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,479
consolidate more and then go a little

195
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,919
bit further in the direction you were

196
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,000
hoping for that's high resistance so

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,020
if a new Trader or a

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,120
Break Even Trader someone that makes a

199
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
little bit of money then loses it

200
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,139
when they are met with those kinds of

201
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,960
conditions in the marketplace it tends

202
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,580
to create very

203
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,400
sporadic emotional responses in their

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,840
psyche they become agitated they will

205
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,960
many times get stopped out because they

206
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,220
want to move their stop loss too

207
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,199
aggressively too soon

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,958
or they're afraid to get stopped out and

209
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,099
open their stop loss a little bit

210
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,640
further and it runs for that as well and

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,559
they regret having moved their stock to

212
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,860
a larger stop loss

213
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,880
understanding what a high resistance

214
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,100
liquidy run is

215
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,980
will help you to filter those types of

216
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,779
Trades out doesn't mean you can't trade

217
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,940
them or paper trade them or tape read it

218
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,899
just means that you don't want to be

219
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,519
putting a lot of emphasis on trading in

220
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,399
those environments but more specifically

221
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,839
waiting for low resistance liquidity

222
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,260
runs

223
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,720
all right here's the daily chart in here

224
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
you can see how we've hit that bearish

225
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,920
order block I mentioned the last time we

226
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,880
spoke

227
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,360
hit it now it is consolidating inside

228
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
of that Gap right there now look at all

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,580
the back and forth here up down up down

230
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,519
so it's being met with that

231
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,880
in the form of high resistance now can

232
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,200
this go higher with the dollar going

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,420
lower absolutely

234
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,019
can it work its way through this area

235
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,940
here and attack the cell side below it

236
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,440
absolutely

237
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,920
but because it's not one-sided because

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
it's not

239
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,880
so heavy-handed or

240
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,860
because I can justify both sides of the

241
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,320
marketplace right now

242
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
it's a neutral position for me

243
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,260
that means I want to only be Trading

244
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,620
when it's high probability and with low

245
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,600
resistance liquidity run signatures that

246
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,220
means that the market is more likely to

247
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,019
run quickly right to where I think it's

248
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,160
going to go

249
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,860
either it be a liquidity

250
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,380
or a inefficiency

251
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,899
so if I'm looking for lower prices and

252
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,760
if I was being honest with you gone to

253
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,959
my head I think the dollar is going to

254
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,779
go higher and I think eventually euro

255
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,080
dollar will attack these lows in here

256
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,740
will it meet it before running out this

257
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,760
high

258
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
that I don't know but because I don't

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,200
know that I'm sitting still with my

260
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,760
hands in my pocket not willing to do

261
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,260
anything

262
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,959
but every time I sit down with you I'm

263
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,820
always going to tell you what I believe

264
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,060
is likely to occur if I'm being forced

265
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,120
into a corner say Okay ICT what is it

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,260
you think is going to happen right now

267
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,640
regardless of whether you want to take a

268
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,260
trade in what do you think is going to

269
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,420
happen and that's what I do

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,480
I like giving commentary in the analysis

271
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,640
when the market is one-sided and it's in

272
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,200
low resistance the Kodi run signatures

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,300
because it's very pleasing for me to

274
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,740
share it and then you watch it happen in

275
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,560
your charts right now we don't have that

276
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,019
okay a lot of objectives have been met

277
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,600
recently both in dollar

278
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,140
and Euro and index futures

279
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,060
so we have to let the market consolidate

280
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,000
in month one of my mentorship core

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
content

282
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
on my YouTube channel I introduced the

283
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,120
idea of the four stages of price

284
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,459
delivery and

285
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,100
consolidation

286
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,620
expansion retracement and reversal those

287
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
four stages of price delivery

288
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,940
we are in now a consolidation so we have

289
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,899
to wait

290
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,060
you have to Simply wait

291
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,579
you don't want to push the envelope here

292
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,500
and try to

293
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,940
predict

294
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,260
what it's going to do when it's like

295
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,660
this it's easy to predict where price is

296
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,579
going to draw to when it's one-sided in

297
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,440
a low resistance liquidity run that

298
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,079
means it's very easy to see one side

299
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,540
either a buy or a cell and very very

300
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,300
difficult to justify the opposite side

301
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,180
of the marketplace so an example would

302
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,220
be let's assume that the market only had

303
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,040
one single low swing and not not the

304
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,260
back and forth trading range that we

305
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,200
have in this area here so prices spent a

306
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,240
lot of time working in this range here

307
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,920
so it's going to take a real significant

308
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,339
price move to get down below it

309
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,240
so if it were only a single

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,820
low and then reverse like a V bottom

311
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,399
type thing then it would be very easy to

312
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,440
assume that this would

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,660
continuously move lower and then it

314
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,339
would be a low resistance liquidity run

315
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,660
short

316
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,339
and then obviously the opposite should

317
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,680
be seen for a long in the dollar Index

318
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,959
but because we don't have that

319
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,060
we have to sit and wait for more

320
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,959
information

321
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,820
otherwise you're trading with low

322
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,100
probability can you make money possibly

323
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,899
but it's more likely that you'll be

324
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,680
wrong

325
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,180
and because I'm teaching you the

326
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,040
distinctions between High Resistance and

327
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,019
low resistance the quality runs

328
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,079
if you do engage it and you lose you'll

329
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,700
regret having done so because I've

330
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,019
already told you now it's lower

331
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,680
probability

332
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,880
all right here's the hourly chart on

333
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,260
euro dollar

334
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,600
so the last time we sat with each other

335
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
it was a live stream earlier

336
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,760
and I mentioned this area here how the

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,459
market ran up hit buy side traded into a

338
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,160
short-term premium relative this High to

339
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,899
that low and then once you hit the buy

340
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,360
side and that premium

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,339
very bad Gap in the form of a city sauce

342
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,560
on a balanced box on an efficiency it

343
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
worked lower to attack the sell side

344
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,920
here

345
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,560
there was South liquidity here and the

346
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
market was hanging right around this

347
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,040
area here and we'll look at that on a

348
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,260
15-minute time frame but eventually it

349
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,779
moved higher to the top end of that

350
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,459
daily fair value Gap

351
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,800
then went lower failed to make the lower

352
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,860
low here and then reversed higher to

353
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,220
trade into a deeper premium

354
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,720
further up in the upper portion of this

355
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,940
60 Minute fair value Gap in the form of

356
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,139
a sell-side imbalanced by certain

357
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,760
efficiency

358
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,050
then back into that daily fair value Gap

359
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,639
[Music]

360
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,860
so now in a 15-minute time frame here's

361
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,380
that hourly fair value guy

362
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,839
it ran up into it here

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,420
and notice what we were talking about in

364
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,399
the live stream I said while we were

365
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,700
hitting this area here I said if it were

366
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,920
going to go lower and it would be a high

367
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
probability scenario for it to go lower

368
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,500
I would prefer to see price stay below

369
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,579
this level here

370
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,980
if it was to go higher

371
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm not interested in going lower

372
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,740
basically consequent encouragement

373
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,720
from the fear I got high and the fair

374
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,579
value Gap low and that shaded area here

375
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,060
is the daily fair value Gap

376
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,060
if we were to meet consequent

377
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,279
encroachment and then break down and

378
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,620
create another survey Gap that would be

379
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,360
viewed as

380
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,880
a premium array then I would look for

381
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,120
that low and that larger Celsius

382
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,360
to be taken but because if it were to go

383
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
higher remember I would prefer it to

384
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,500
stay around consequent encroachment

385
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,839
not go to the high because if it does

386
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,100
that

387
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,320
all that means to me is it goes back

388
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,240
down lower

389
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,120
it's likely to not go below that low

390
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,620
go back and listen to the live stream

391
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,720
where I was talking about it in here the

392
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,760
reason why I'm not interested in once it

393
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,279
gets up to here even though it did drop

394
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,279
notice it dropped handsomely from this

395
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,740
high of the fair value Gap but didn't

396
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,199
take out the sell side

397
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,800
because we are in that neutral zone for

398
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,839
me as a Trader where I don't want to

399
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,920
take a trade

400
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,399
if we're to tape read or study it

401
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,260
ideally we want to see consequent

402
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,560
encroachment which is the halfway point

403
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,120
of that Gap

404
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
which is in the iron shaded hue that

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,820
should be not traded back to the high

406
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,860
end but if it does

407
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,839
and it starts to sell off this is a trap

408
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,940
this low won't be taken in this cell

409
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,500
side and this cell side will be left

410
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,420
intact

411
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,339
they run higher

412
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,260
to take out the Asia high this is the

413
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,000
Asian kill Zoom

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,220
and this is the London Killzone

415
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,740
so the market trades down fails to go

416
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,940
lower

417
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,920
runs a short-term high so as a shift to

418
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,600
Market structure

419
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,399
Buys in a balance outside and efficiency

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
here trades down the consequent

421
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,279
encroachment which is the midpoint of

422
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,560
the gap between those candles low and

423
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,600
this candle is high there's your silver

424
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,399
bullet for Euro

425
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,899
rallies

426
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,579
find some support at that daily fair

427
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,920
value gaps yeah it's respecting that

428
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,500
runs up and consolidates in consequent

429
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,940
encroachment which is the midpoint of

430
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,220
the Gap High and the low consolidation

431
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,440
expansion

432
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,260
respects the high of it opens and runs

433
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,079
through it takes out age as high

434
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,500
swings all the way up into to take by

435
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,020
side and trade into a deeper premium on

436
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,000
that hourly fair value Gap in the form

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,439
of a city

438
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,419
this area up here that's shaded in pink

439
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,179
is this area here

440
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,299
on the hourly so this run

441
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,819
from here to here is this

442
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,700
on the 15 from that low up to that high

443
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,620
then we draw right back down into the

444
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,720
midpoint of that fair value Gap

445
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,480
so again it's reaching for liquidity I

446
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,039
like the idea

447
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,500
that we did come all the way back up

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,740
here to take out buy stops to me I think

449
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,380
that favors a continued move lower

450
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,320
because they left this low and they left

451
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,840
the larger pool of liquidity again I'll

452
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,820
take you right back up to the

453
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,679
that's this low here so there's sell

454
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,660
side here and there's a little bit of a

455
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,820
gap right there you can notice that

456
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,340
the little trading view icon things in

457
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,419
the way but

458
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,220
this candle's high and that candle's low

459
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,780
that's a buy side of balance outside of

460
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,020
efficiency and you have salsa

461
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,260
and you have relative equal lows here

462
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,940
so we came all the way back up to take

463
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,500
out the buy side

464
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,919
all of this is efficiently delivered

465
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,900
so if it was the trade up to the high

466
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,220
end of that that would have been perfect

467
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,500
but it left a small little portion in

468
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,840
there and broke down

469
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
I want to see it run for the sell side

470
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,660
here and here so I'm thinking want to

471
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,299
660 and maybe lower

472
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,100
but that's what I'm looking for going

473
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,559
into London to New York tomorrow that's

474
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,360
what I would favor that does not mean

475
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,980
I'm trading it it just means that that's

476
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,960
my gun to my head that's what I believe

477
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,660
based on what I'm looking at here if I'm

478
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,400
accurate about dollar going higher

479
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,320
that's what I would expect to see okay

480
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
so dump at the farm on it I'm just

481
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
telling you what I'm seeing in price

482
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,580
action

483
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,679
all right yes even the s p June contract

484
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,780
we'll be rolling over into the September

485
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,460
contract here shortly

486
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,799
but for around we're just looking at the

487
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,179
June contract

488
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,160
so

489
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
this Gap in here

490
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
is what I said we would draw up into we

491
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
obviously did that and we're looking at

492
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,679
the weekly chart and the Candlestick is

493
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,740
represented as such here so we hit the

494
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,860
high of that Gap and then we've been

495
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,720
banging around inside that which is

496
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,880
typical when price runs to a higher time

497
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,919
frame Target

498
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,679
lower time frame candlesticks and charts

499
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,299
will move into a consolidation profile

500
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,799
consolidation profile after multiple

501
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,080
markets have met their objectives as I

502
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
mentioned with the dollar Index hit

503
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,799
straight up into our premium objectives

504
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,600
Euros traded down into our discount

505
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,020
objectives and Es has traded into its

506
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,740
premium objectives so when that occurs

507
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,679
the market will tend to do what

508
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,059
consolidate which is why I'm saying I'm

509
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,700
neutral so you can see how there's a a

510
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,440
relationship between how I teach market

511
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,900
profiles not Market profile in the sense

512
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,480
that you think it is but profiles in the

513
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
sense of like schematics

514
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
a road map if you will okay uh

515
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
typical Behavior

516
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,919
or

517
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,539
performance

518
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,559
by Price something that looks familiar

519
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,480
that's generally what I'm trying to get

520
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,900
at and I taught and gave out specific

521
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,780
schematics for weekly profiles and daily

522
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,160
profiles so you can see what type of

523
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,559
performance price will behave like

524
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,419
because the algorithm will tend to

525
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,000
follow those types of profiles

526
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,100
and right now because the market has met

527
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,780
our objectives that we've been looking

528
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,360
for for a couple weeks now

529
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,860
it just sits still for a little while

530
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,080
and disconsolidates

531
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,940
it doesn't mean it's going to reverse it

532
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,080
doesn't mean it's going to explode and

533
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,559
continue it just means that we wait we

534
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,320
wait for more information now what I do

535
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
notice in here and I failed to mention

536
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
last time we were doing the live stream

537
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,760
there's a volume and balance in here

538
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,380
right there between this candle is

539
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,980
closed this candle is opening and we're

540
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,340
inside this Gap here it would be

541
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,500
fine for it to drop down into that area

542
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,179
there so around 4240 ish and that still

543
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,700
would not break the

544
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,980
structure that would it is going to go

545
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,700
higher and move like it did in NASDAQ

546
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,460
this High here where there's buy side

547
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,039
that would be the next draw on upside

548
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,679
but short term it may consolidate or

549
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,480
retrace down into this area right in

550
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,980
here that's a volume imbalance and I

551
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,240
don't want to have too many lines on the

552
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,620
chart but you want to have that on yours

553
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,500
in the event that we do retrace lower it

554
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,700
might want to draw into that area

555
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,520
as long as we stay

556
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,919
above this candle why am I picking that

557
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,220
candle we've already worked inside these

558
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,840
two down closed candles that's your

559
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,280
bullish order block consecutive down

560
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,620
closed candle it traded down into that

561
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,840
and repelled price higher

562
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,480
if it was the color outside the lines of

563
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,980
this volume imbalance which is that

564
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,780
white shaded area

565
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,179
it can trade down into consequent

566
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,419
encroachment of this candle's tail so

567
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,679
about right there which is essentially

568
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,679
the low of that volume balance

569
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,600
it can go a little bit past the little

570
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,220
you know somewhat but I don't want to go

571
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,659
below there

572
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,760
if it trades below it not doesn't

573
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
require a close if it trades down below

574
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,780
that then I would be more reluctant to

575
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,059
anticipate that high being the next run

576
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,659
on liquidity okay so in layman's terms

577
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm expecting it to consolidate inside

578
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,620
this white shaded area

579
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,020
allowing up to a retracement into this

580
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,600
area here worst case scenario half of

581
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
this candle's tail

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,940
but not below that candle's low okay so

583
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,140
as long as we're remaining above that

584
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,179
candle's low right there I'm staying

585
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,320
with the idea that we could potentially

586
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,440
go higher like we've seen in NASDAQ

587
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
everything can change you know overnight

588
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,880
going into tomorrow but based on what

589
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,020
this chart's showing you right now

590
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,580
that's my opinion

591
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,039
[Music]

592
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,580
daily chart here for yes we have a fair

593
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,360
value Gap in here

594
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,740
shift in Market structure

595
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,740
drops into a fair value Gap rallies up

596
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,080
and into our Gap

597
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,700
so in the upper portion of that volume

598
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,960
of balance on the weekly chart which is

599
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,539
that white shaded area and that specific

600
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,280
area where there was no trading it's

601
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,260
worked its way up in there and now look

602
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,520
how it's just hanging around in there

603
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,600
see that

604
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,820
interesting isn't it watch what happens

605
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,000
when we drop into a lower time frame

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,580
here's the hourly chart

607
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,220
this blue line is the high of that

608
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,960
Weekly Gap

609
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
this blue line is the low of that Weekly

610
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,380
Gap

611
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,059
the white shaded area is the volume and

612
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,140
balance

613
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm drawing your attention to this Wick

614
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,179
right here in its midpoint which is

615
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,740
consequent encroachment

616
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,200
so this is a discount array because it's

617
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,539
below market price

618
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,400
let's play devil's advocate for a moment

619
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,919
and let's assume for the sake of

620
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,260
discussion that the market does in fact

621
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,120
want to go higher

622
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,120
it could trade down into this area here

623
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,179
and then run for by side notice how he

624
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,039
left clean highs here

625
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,780
so that looks like perfect textbook

626
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,200
resistance I don't like that I never

627
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,419
like that

628
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,659
smooth edges like to be made Jagged okay

629
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,159
I have an expression I say it many times

630
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,539
and

631
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,539
I think this will be disrupted

632
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,500
now how and when it will occur

633
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,419
we have to watch and see what price does

634
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,700
at each Killzone okay or specific times

635
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,679
of the day where we like to trade

636
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,860
so I want to see do we respect price at

637
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,760
this

638
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,980
discount consequent encouragement of

639
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,179
that Wick

640
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,700
if it runs through it there is another

641
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,820
Wick right there so this midpoint of

642
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,900
that one you want to draw that out in

643
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
time too

644
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,120
it's also basically these highs

645
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,200
now

646
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,860
what I don't like about that is I don't

647
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,360
like it going back down to these

648
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,159
relative equal highs because that's

649
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,600
treated as what resistance turn

650
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,860
potential support right I don't like

651
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,039
that so take us back into that higher

652
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,900
time frame daily chart remember what I

653
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,440
said about 42.40

654
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,039
4240

655
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,840
is in that volume and balance on the

656
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
daily chart so it could trade down into

657
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,500
and Below these highs here if it really

658
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,240
wants to be aggressive

659
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,400
trade down through that all the way to

660
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,500
the low of that volume and balance on

661
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,299
the weekly chart

662
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,980
which would take us into this area right

663
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,080
here

664
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,700
right there

665
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,820
okay so just be mindful I I don't have

666
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,760
like an affinity for like these levels

667
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,860
here draw that out in time and if it

668
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,299
comes down to it we'll treat this

669
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,220
support

670
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,440
and I don't see that as resistance okay

671
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
I think this is like knocking on

672
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,159
heaven's door so

673
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,840
um they may need to take it down deeper

674
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,640
just try to sell the idea that this is

675
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,679
resistance and then come back up later

676
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,960
on and you know break through this here

677
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,159
like

678
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,740
gunbusters uh this area here I don't

679
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,480
have a four hour chart tonight but I

680
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,039
added the notation that we showed this

681
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,140
in a live stream yeah the other day

682
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,279
yesterday

683
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,279
and it's based on the four hour

684
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,440
Tuesday May 23rd

685
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,260
10 A.M

686
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,640
inversion pair that you got so you can

687
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
watch the live stream you'll see it's it

688
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,700
was there and that's what we're seeing

689
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,559
the respect of there and this is the

690
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,090
daily fair value you got inside of that

691
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,419
[Music]

692
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,980
all right here's the 50-minute time

693
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,240
frame on ES today

694
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,840
hi

695
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,360
look how it's thought right at the High

696
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
of that volume and balance hooks that's

697
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,980
perfect it goes right to the tick

698
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,380
not in your textbooks just in the book

699
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,720
of ICT

700
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
brakes lower trades to the low of the

701
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,720
Gap now this line and that line are

702
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,260
the Gap levels on our weekly chart for

703
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,340
ES

704
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,200
the white shaded area is the volume of

705
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,720
balance this is that Wick

706
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,640
discount Council encouragement

707
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,260
level that I just showed you before we

708
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,120
drop down and go back up

709
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,100
that's this one here okay so Wick

710
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,080
discount consequent encroachment there

711
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,380
I can already hear some of the newer

712
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
students this is really complicated

713
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,220
everything's complicated when you first

714
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,240
start

715
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,520
so I'm thinking that we could draw down

716
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,220
into that and how we trade to it and if

717
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,320
through it

718
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,360
all the factors I just gave you for the

719
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,539
other hourly chart they are to be

720
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,279
weighed out that's why I'm I'm waiting

721
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,360
to see I don't have a very clear

722
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,059
definitive here's my next setup I'm

723
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,159
watching those levels to see how it

724
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,679
forms Market structure around them

725
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,419
so I'm not trying to guess I'm not

726
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,960
trying to be

727
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,279
predictive yet okay so I'm sitting

728
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,440
neutral we're not reacting the price we

729
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,720
never react to price but we're sitting

730
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,919
still waiting for more information so

731
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,779
that way we can predict the next outcome

732
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,840
right now it's uncertain but I do

733
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,640
I have the opinion if the gun is in my

734
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,200
head or I think it's going to go I think

735
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
it's going to go lower first to go

736
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,880
higher later

737
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,020
and the five minute chart you can see

738
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,360
here we had buy side resting above these

739
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
highs here in this short term high this

740
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,380
is your opening range due to swing so it

741
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,360
rallies up hits the high that Weekly Gap

742
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,620
High

743
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,419
and drops lower so now there's a buy

744
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:55,860
side resting below that

745
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,600
to the left over here

746
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
is the other relative equal high on

747
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,340
Monday that formed so over here

748
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,320
you can see how you hit it

749
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,080
broke lower Drew back into current new

750
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,840
week opening Gap

751
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
came back up to it anyways opening Gap

752
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,940
and then rejected traded down to the

753
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,679
weekly Gap low and then Consolidated

754
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,500
around it notice that this low to the

755
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,740
high in this range here it's essentially

756
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,080
hugging that Weekly get well

757
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,059
so it's kind of like a equilibrium price

758
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,640
point in this consolidation in here

759
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,919
and I would suspect it I want to trade

760
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,840
down into that 4264 4240 ish level

761
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,640
anything below 4240 then obviously we

762
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,279
have to keep our mind on seeing that

763
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,020
daily level I've told you about I didn't

764
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,430
want to see it Go below

765
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,179
[Music]

766
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,980
right below here

767
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,460
is sell side okay right below there so

768
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,200
all this run up

769
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,240
it ran for the sell side

770
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,279
the weekly Gap low

771
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,740
and all this area in here I'm going to

772
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,100
teach you

773
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,840
a little bit more about gaps but for now

774
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,279
here is the am session ICT Silver Bullet

775
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,159
trading up into that Gap High

776
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,559
swing low is right there so I hit our

777
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,020
higher time frame weekly objective

778
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,140
that's a key level it hits it breaks

779
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,299
lower shift in Market structure that's

780
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,919
bearish

781
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,140
small little imbalance here this right

782
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,120
here

783
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,140
that move right there that is the 2022

784
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,500
ICT mentorship model

785
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,299
so

786
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:43,320
buy side taken into a premium

787
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,960
shift in Market structure fair value Gap

788
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,179
trades up into it there's your show go

789
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,020
short

790
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,260
what do you aim for relative equal lows

791
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,200
and liquidity

792
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
if you want to be overzealous you can

793
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,020
aim for the weekly Gap low I personally

794
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,940
wouldn't have but for the sake of

795
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,399
argument you could have

796
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,679
now if you're trading the ICT Silver

797
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,480
Bullet which is the model that I've

798
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,600
taught you for 2023 for the YouTube I

799
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,460
teach mentorship

800
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,220
we have a shift in Market structure and

801
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,020
it's much more pronounced

802
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,260
so this swing low here is broken

803
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,940
we have a fair value gap between this

804
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,380
candle's high and that candle is low

805
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,260
this is a civi cells on imbalanced by

806
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,480
sound efficiency

807
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
price returns back up

808
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,640
there's your short

809
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,159
you'd have to endure one more time in a

810
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,200
small amount of draw down in here

811
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,179
it spends a little bit of time and then

812
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,279
finally gives up the ghost breaks one

813
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,899
more time below that low

814
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,760
digs into this sell side but notice that

815
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,880
that low is just barely below those

816
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,340
you know what it's reaching for new week

817
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,640
opening Gap they're like a magnet okay

818
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,159
the market drops comes back up another

819
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,779
fair value Gap so you could have taken

820
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,600
this one if you didn't take that one or

821
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,820
you could have traded this one short

822
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,760
pyramided more in here

823
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,740
drops down look where that low is on

824
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,419
that candle right there that's the new

825
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,980
week opening Gap below

826
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,860
bang perfect right to the tick

827
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,179
runs right back up in

828
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,779
returning back to the old Fairway Gap

829
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,360
dropping aggressive

830
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,520
small Gap in here around new week

831
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,500
opening Gap

832
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,880
Trace up into it here which is

833
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
institutional order flow integer drill

834
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,179
which is a partial

835
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,460
return into not a complete closure of

836
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,740
that Gap that candles high that candle

837
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,940
is low

838
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,399
just a little bit above the low and then

839
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,960
consolidates

840
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,480
and tears often goes lower and I'm going

841
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,520
to tell you how that love would be

842
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,000
significant

843
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,620
do you take the high here and add your

844
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,360
FIB to it here and draw it down to that

845
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,600
low

846
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,159
one standard deviation

847
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,940
would be 42.78.75

848
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,179
that's a pretty handsome objective if we

849
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,519
treat that high to that low this low

850
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,200
being a fulcrum point

851
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
that means if this move from high to

852
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,940
that low

853
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,640
s like a door okay and it swung this was

854
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,220
the hinge of the door this high if it

855
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,279
was allowed to swing completely all the

856
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,779
way around

857
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,519
it would come right down right below

858
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,600
that low here it would come to that

859
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,100
price point here so all I'm saying is

860
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,820
this range from that low to high

861
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,500
subtracted from that low takes us right

862
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
to this 4278.75

863
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,539
that's pretty good isn't it you know so

864
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,820
that's a pretty good run for a silver

865
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,100
bullet

866
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,640
getting short around the 4298 level

867
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,539
that's one two three four five six seven

868
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,659
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

869
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,940
fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen

870
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,600
eighteen nineteen handles that's a

871
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,040
pretty good day

872
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,020
even if you're trading with one contract

873
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,699
let's go a little bit further

874
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,560
now I'm going to teach you Advanced Gap

875
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,060
Theory

876
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,679
we're going to take a look at that same

877
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
price swing all of this is the the

878
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
initial runoff this is a Judah swing

879
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,080
okay

880
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,980
in the first 30 minutes of trading so at

881
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,440
9 30 opening bell we see the price run

882
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,820
higher

883
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,500
stops dead in its tracks at the weekly

884
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,899
Gap High the Gap high that I told you

885
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,500
about weeks ago

886
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,719
having that level on your chart and then

887
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,399
anticipating

888
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,780
price reacting there

889
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,359
swing low it breaks lower and that gives

890
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,099
us this small little Gap right there

891
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,918
this Gap right there is simply a fair

892
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,500
value Gap it's a common Gap they can be

893
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,000
traded though with the context I've

894
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,820
already taught you 2022 model buy side

895
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,460
higher time frame level

896
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,320
takes buy side does it go after the

897
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,599
short term low yes it does did it leave

898
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,060
a gap yes it did okay trade up into it

899
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,200
it does

900
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,839
go Short Stop Above This candle's high

901
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,960
right there if you're really scared and

902
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,540
you don't want to take a larger risk put

903
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,980
your stock right above here and trade

904
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,119
with less Leverage

905
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,579
the market breaks lower and we have this

906
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,859
Gap right here

907
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,380
this is a fair value Gap in the form of

908
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,839
a city just like this is but this is a

909
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,940
breakaway Gap what is it doing it's

910
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,000
breaking away from this important higher

911
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,220
time frame High

912
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,640
inside the model of the 2022

913
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,940
ICT mentorship model that I taught you

914
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,300
and it's moving aggressive so we have

915
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,599
one two two times there's a shift in

916
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,280
Market structure that's bearish

917
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,960
this is a breakaway Gap Breakaway gaps

918
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,400
must it must have some context as to why

919
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,339
price should see for instance this is a

920
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,760
bearish breakaway Gap it's breaking away

921
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,020
from a level that we would already

922
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,040
anticipate being some measure of a short

923
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,220
okay some context around this level we

924
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,960
would expect to see some kind of respect

925
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,060
of that level okay so it's a higher

926
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,740
timing weekly get high we've already

927
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,780
been there on Monday repelled lower

928
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,060
we created a short-term High prior to it

929
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
here and it ran up to it there and then

930
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,280
it took that low out there left the Gap

931
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,619
that in itself is the 2022 model

932
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,599
then it breaks again

933
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,200
returns back into it here with the leave

934
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,300
relative equal lows

935
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,520
so there's your fulcrum point from low

936
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,180
to high

937
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,880
you may have missed the 2022 model entry

938
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,339
here no problem

939
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:02,220
the return back into this Gap here

940
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,119
Breakaway gaps tend to leave a portion

941
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,820
of the Gap unfilled

942
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,520
from this candle is low to this candle

943
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,839
is high

944
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,579
it retraces all the way up into this

945
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,320
level so between these highs of these

946
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,839
candles and that candle is low there's a

947
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,060
small portion that's left open we would

948
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,220
expect to see that if this is going to

949
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,320
be a gap say you went short into it here

950
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,859
and you're seeing it watch it in here

951
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,839
your stop if you were shorting in here

952
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,420
would be above this candle's High

953
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,040
not fearing any return back into this

954
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,980
because we have two shifts in Market

955
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,500
structure

956
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,060
this

957
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,820
return in here you're anticipating while

958
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,040
entering the street you're expecting

959
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,780
this portion to stay open

960
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,579
if it does

961
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,380
you want to see that happen anyway for

962
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,359
your trade

963
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,579
but if it doesn't and it completely

964
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,859
fills it in that's not a breakaway cup

965
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,500
then it may need to come back up and tap

966
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,720
this one more time

967
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,900
so if you were to get stopped out

968
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,460
you have to wait for it to hit this Fair

969
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,380
bit you got and then break one more time

970
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,180
create another imbalance or a fair value

971
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,940
and then use that to go short

972
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,740
so what I just taught you is how you

973
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,720
navigate if you're wrong and it doesn't

974
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,420
become a breakaway Gap

975
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,040
you wait for it to trade to the higher

976
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,540
time frame if you're Vega and then break

977
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,220
lower again create another fair value

978
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,380
and treat that as a potential later

979
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,119
Breakaway Gap

980
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,480
but the context is it's running up here

981
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,400
that get Traders thinking it's going

982
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,440
higher bullish

983
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,839
okay from this low up to this high in

984
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,099
here this looks like a bull flag I

985
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,440
guarantee it the most retail Traders

986
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,940
and when it went above that high here

987
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,740
that validated everyone thinking that

988
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,060
it's a bull flag

989
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,099
then it broke lower

990
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,780
now if you didn't have that Weekly Gap

991
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,980
High

992
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,599
you would never understand what I'm

993
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,160
showing you here but you've known that

994
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,980
level for weeks

995
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,260
it broke down and then here is a

996
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,960
breakaway cap it's qualified as a

997
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,660
breakaway Gap because it leaves and goes

998
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,359
lower to another new low and leaves that

999
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,240
portion open at that time we get real

1000
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,099
confident that it never will come back

1001
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,480
up to this level here so we can drop our

1002
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,820
spot right to that level there and let

1003
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,119
it roll

1004
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,440
then we have

1005
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,200
these two candles here these are one

1006
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,520
minute candles so this is essentially

1007
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
two minutes

1008
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,960
of a fair value Gap so this is a

1009
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,660
standard typical ICT Fairbank Gap in the

1010
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,460
form of a city

1011
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,260
and you can see them come back and trade

1012
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,520
back to them

1013
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,740
they're like again a common Gap common

1014
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,500
gaps can be retraded to multiple times

1015
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,420
and they reclaim them sometimes as

1016
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,780
supporter resistance

1017
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,359
[Music]

1018
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,220
and then we have this large gap here

1019
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,380
these two down closed candles

1020
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,260
that's one big theory about you got in

1021
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,540
the form of a sibi if we were looking at

1022
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,579
a two minute chart right now it's one

1023
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,500
minute if you do this on your own charts

1024
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,880
look at this area here on a two minute

1025
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,380
chart

1026
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,660
this one candle down

1027
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,760
so it's only trading back up into

1028
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,619
consequent correction of the two minute

1029
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,060
range

1030
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,520
of these two specific one minute candles

1031
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,960
so in Easy language and layman's terms

1032
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,700
from this candle is low and this candle

1033
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,560
is high when a two minute chart this is

1034
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,440
one down close candle midpoint of that

1035
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,940
is where it's trading here that's

1036
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,359
consequent encroachments

1037
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,400
this is the fair value Gap in the form

1038
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
of a civi cells on imbalanced bison

1039
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,420
deficiency

1040
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,880
and it's a measuring Gap

1041
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,619
what's that mean

1042
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,740
we can take this range and use it for

1043
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,099
projection

1044
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,200
the market breaks lower and then we have

1045
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,359
another fair value Gap in the form of a

1046
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,400
city you can look at this on a two

1047
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,020
minute chart this will be one down

1048
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,060
closed candle and again essentially

1049
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,000
working into consequent encroachment

1050
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,099
taking buy side here and then breaking

1051
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,740
lower to a lower low below that Weekly

1052
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,839
Gap low

1053
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,420
standard fair value gaps which are

1054
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,119
common gaps they can be reclaimed or

1055
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,060
traded back to as resistance or support

1056
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,680
trades back up to it here look at the

1057
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,240
bodies of the candles here

1058
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,839
that's telling you what the narrative if

1059
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,960
you're reading my Gap Theory

1060
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,420
in price if you see these signatures

1061
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,040
like this see I'm going to tell you all

1062
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,960
the time

1063
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,660
the bodies tell you the story

1064
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,720
the Wicks do the damage the Wix is what

1065
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,380
everybody else gets messed up with

1066
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,480
dojis and specific you know types of

1067
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,940
Candlestick formations nonsense it's all

1068
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,760
nonsense okay

1069
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,060
reading price action naked with time

1070
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,440
and looking for these types of

1071
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
signatures here the open and close of

1072
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,820
these two candles here are supporting

1073
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,220
the idea that this low

1074
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,579
of that inefficiency is being respected

1075
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,640
and then price does what it trades lower

1076
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,839
where does it trade too

1077
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,260
below the sell side here but not some

1078
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,920
random level

1079
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,460
if we take the high of that price swing

1080
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,820
and draw all that Fibonacci all the way

1081
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,020
down to that candle's high right there

1082
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,240
from high

1083
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,700
to lower the Gap why this Gap because

1084
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,160
this is the measuring Gap

1085
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,320
it's approximately half

1086
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,880
of a

1087
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,760
implied dealing range implied meaning

1088
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,920
we're looking for it to go lower but we

1089
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,500
haven't seen price go there yet

1090
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,359
we're not reacting remember we're

1091
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,780
predicting price so the high here draw

1092
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,300
that down to that candle's high right

1093
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,200
there

1094
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,319
right there okay

1095
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,640
what that does is gives you a projection

1096
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,480
to a standard deviation of negative one

1097
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,680
and I showed you in the live stream

1098
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,480
yesterday so if you want to watch the

1099
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,579
video prior to this one in the ICT

1100
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,160
mentorship 2023 playlist

1101
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,400
go to the section where it shows the

1102
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,359
Fibonacci settings and you'll get the

1103
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,040
settings that I can

1104
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,200
share with you there but the negative

1105
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,920
one standard deviation comes in at 42

1106
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,760
69.25 okay I screenshot this so that way

1107
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,800
I have my cursor right underneath there

1108
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,079
so that way the data that you see up in

1109
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,240
the upper left hand corner here the low

1110
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,599
comes in exactly at 42 69.25 folks that

1111
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,980
is the daily low

1112
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,619
to the tick

1113
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,020
right there and it never went lower

1114
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,040
today

1115
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,940
even after our session didn't go lower

1116
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,160
so

1117
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
this is my ICT swing projection Theory

1118
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,780
when I break the market down see gaps

1119
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,839
are just like a pdra matrix

1120
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,720
they have an hierarchy okay

1121
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,180
you have a breakaway Gap you have common

1122
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,339
gaps common gaps can be reclaimed that

1123
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,560
means treated multiple times

1124
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,220
measuring gaps tend to leave a portion

1125
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,980
open just like a brake wake up so if

1126
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,900
we're expecting it to go lower it stands

1127
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,040
the reason that we expect it not to

1128
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,359
trade all the way up here

1129
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,680
and if we're expecting it to be a

1130
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,780
measuring Gap guess what we want to see

1131
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,060
it not go up there and that confirms and

1132
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,339
qualifies it as a measuring Gap then we

1133
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:33,960
can take the high project it down to the

1134
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,240
low of the Gap if we're bearish and then

1135
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,060
get our standard deviations but that's

1136
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,280
standard deviation negative one has to

1137
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,200
be in agreement with moving below an old

1138
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,160
area

1139
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,740
of liquidity

1140
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,740
so that's between these two things makes

1141
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,800
us have the Precision okay it's not

1142
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,599
simply you take a fib put it over two

1143
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:55,980
different price swings and then you're

1144
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,200
going to get the same math that I have

1145
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,700
but

1146
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,760
understanding that gaps have an

1147
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,780
hierarchy

1148
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,780
okay and this is how I qualify my gaps

1149
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,180
every time you watch me do a recorded

1150
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,800
Trading

1151
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,319
episode where I'm going in I'm trading

1152
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,900
live data and I'm pyramiding and adding

1153
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,339
and pyramiding and adding and I'm taking

1154
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,720
partials off and I'm looking for a

1155
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,220
specific level

1156
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,040
I'm using this logic here when I'm

1157
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,540
drawing out when I say I want to leave

1158
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,760
this see this portion of the Gap stay

1159
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,440
open I want to see this portion of the

1160
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,119
Gap statement ideal if it leaves this

1161
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,160
portion open unfilled

1162
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,960
it's this Theory I'm teaching you right

1163
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,780
here okay

1164
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,460
common gaps

1165
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,520
are a fair value Gap that can be

1166
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,640
reclaimed treated as support and

1167
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,280
resistance we see that here it comes

1168
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,400
back up and bangs It And Trades lower

1169
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,200
this Gap here

1170
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,119
projected through all this mess here

1171
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,220
it's not supply and demand folks Sam

1172
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,500
seiden has no idea what this is

1173
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,359
trade up into it here the bodies of the

1174
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,760
candles respect that candles

1175
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,680
high right there

1176
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,880
perfect

1177
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,500
don't take my word for it look at the

1178
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,819
data

1179
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,920
and then it trades lower and makes the

1180
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,900
very low of the day here using my swing

1181
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,640
projection Theory within the context of

1182
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,780
my Advanced Gap Theory

1183
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,380
so hopefully you enjoyed tonight and

1184
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,540
hope you learned something else

1185
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,940
um obviously if this is your first time

1186
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,940
watching things with gaps or my theory

1187
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,760
on gaps and or swing projections it may

1188
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,859
feel a little bit uh complicated and you

1189
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,420
have a thousand new questions and that's

1190
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,220
wonderful that means you're trying to

1191
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,099
learn and I'm here to teach you don't

1192
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,440
think that you can just watch this video

1193
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,240
and you understand it I want you to go

1194
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,700
back and look at old price swings look

1195
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,859
at all these old price swings and start

1196
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,319
breaking down the gaps and use this

1197
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,300
hierarchy I have more to teach you

1198
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,099
that's deeper in that era because

1199
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:57,240
there's other gaps that I'm going to

1200
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,319
teach you that I haven't even taught my

1201
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,960
charter members yet but that context

1202
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,760
will be taught later on I'm going to do

1203
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,839
it real time

1204
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,660
for now use this as a benchmark to go

1205
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,819
and look at your other old price swings

1206
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,099
and start measuring them out and journal

1207
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,380
them in your trading journal until I

1208
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,640
talk to you next time

1209
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,240
be safe
