1
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,560
hey folks welcome to lesson five of the

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,859
April 2017 ICT mentorship ICT day

3
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,660
trading model this teaching is

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,519
specifically dealing with intraday

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,599
market profiles

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
the intraday market profiles the first

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,020
we're going to go over is

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,660
the Sell profile of London normal

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,379
protraction

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,079
and what you want to be looking for for

11
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,680
a classic Sell day for intraday trading

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,020
there's going to be lots of different

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,420
Deviation and and subtle

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,360
variances in in these specific themes

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,760
they won't look exactly like I'm

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,159
outlining here obviously that's what

17
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,920
makes the trading somewhat difficult

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,540
because you have to look for

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,900
similarities across the board so they're

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,299
going to have a great deal of

21
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,180
similarity among many Sell days and the

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,220
ideal scenarios will look very close to

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,119
what I'm outlining here

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,500
but you start with the Central Bank

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,340
dealers range and for a classic or high

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,680
probability London normal protraction

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,299
Sell day

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,860
the CentralBankDealersRange is going

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,740
to be less than 40 Pips now as soon as

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,060
you see a CentralBankDealersRange

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,820
that's greater than 40 Pips this is not

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,920
going to be that profile so you'll have

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,479
to either go to the next one we'll teach

34
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,820
in this lesson or you just going to

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,020
consider whether or not you're gonna be

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,439
trading on

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,579
the Asian session

38
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
range between eight o'clock and midnight

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,560
NewYork time we call that the Asian

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,520
range

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
this is going to also have a classic

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
range of 20 to 30 Pips if it's larger

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,979
than that again this profile will not be

44
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,459
existing

45
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,400
typically what you're going to see is

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,300
the market will rally up after 12 AM

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
NewYork time to 2 AM NewYork time now

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,620
think about what I'm explaining here

49
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,900
you're already looking for a bearish

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,000
move you're already bearish on the

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
HTF the dailies indicating

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
lower prices so what we're looking for

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,239
is the London High to form

54
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,819
classically the high probability

55
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,580
scenario for this profile to unfold is

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,099
you have to see what time it is in New

57
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,379
York at midnight and then you're going

58
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,360
to be seeing price immediately start

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,300
trading up from that point

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,060
if it does not start trading up into two

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,379
o'clock in the morning

62
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,220
NewYork time that is not this profile

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,560
so right away you have a filter

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,660
you have essential Bank deals range has

65
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,599
to be less than 40 Pips check agent

66
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,780
range has to be 20 30 Pips check now if

67
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,180
those two conditions are there but yet

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,120
we do not see price rallying after 12

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,420
AM NewYork time into 2 AM if that

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,180
does not occur again that is not the

71
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,040
London normal protractionary Sell day

72
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,580
the protractionary stage or Judah swing

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,280
will be one to two StandardDeviation

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
of the CentralBankDealersRange

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,720
now let's recap what I just explained to

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,500
you

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,019
the ideal scenario the one I like to

78
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,120
trade the one that makes me sit on the

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
sideline and wait for these specific

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,900
criteria

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,519
everyone wants to know when I'm trading

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,580
London this is what I'm looking for this

83
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,680
is my money making day this is the thing

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,400
that outlines the whole thing for my

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,519
Sell day for London this is my go-to I

86
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,879
like this profile if I do not have these

87
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,780
ingredients if you will I'm not bacon in

88
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,760
London I'm just not going to do it so

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,040
again let's consider what this is

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,440
outlined if the Central Bank dealers

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,019
range is greater than 40 Pips there's

92
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,238
been a whole lot more later afternoon

93
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,000
NewYork session price action so that

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
means it's been extended further

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,000
if they have allowed the price to move

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
further and arranged greater than 40

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,699
Pips

98
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,699
after 2 PM NewYork time that's going to

99
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,220
mess up their model for allowing the

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,419
float to build

101
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,280
you want to see a consolidation between

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,360
two o'clock PM to 8 PM NewYork time

103
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,880
if that does not exist right away you

104
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,020
have a warning sign that you're probably

105
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,460
not going to be wanting to trade London

106
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,960
now that can change

107
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,780
what makes that change is if the Asian

108
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,840
range goes down to a 20 to 30 pip range

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
and stays very tightly consolidated

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,699
so CentralBankDealersRange can get

111
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,300
wider than 40 Pips but it the Asian

112
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,040
range does not move down into a small

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,979
consolidation of 20 to 30 Pips

114
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,720
you can't take the London session

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
because you've already seen a lot of

116
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
volatility both in Central Bank dealers

117
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
range so it means late NewYork going to

118
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
bonds close there's probably been

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,259
something going on and they are not

120
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,960
allowing float to build up and you have

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,300
to wait until 8 PM for the Asian session

122
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,780
to begin and then between 8 PM NewYork

123
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,780
time midnight NewYork time we'll be

124
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,120
looking for consolidation in a range of

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,100
20 to 30 Pips

126
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,380
if they can consolidate the Asian range

127
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,840
20 30 Pips after a larger than 40 Pips

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,400
CentralBankDealersRange

129
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
then we can go back to electing to look

130
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,820
for this profile

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,000
now the market again has to Rally

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,720
immediately after midnight NewYork time

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,460
and you want to see that sustained

134
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,280
movement higher moving up into towards

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,220
the two o'clock hour in NewYork time so

136
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,320
what that's doing is it's creating that

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,300
initial move that protractionary state

138
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,000
you are looking for the move to be going

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,979
up but the entry can occur as early as 1

140
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,380
30 AM NewYork time one o'clock in the

141
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,479
morning NewYork time

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,600
you want to see immediate movement up

143
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
after 12 AM now it might have a small

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,360
little move down after 12 AM but it'll

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
be modest you're expecting that to turn

146
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,860
up shortly after midnight then you have

147
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,060
to be looking for Price movement at 1am

148
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,639
to 1 30 it should have made a higher

149
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,620
high than that what was seen in the

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,660
Asian range or the Central Bank dealers

151
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,500
range

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,479
that's the protractionary stage in the

153
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,880
marketplace but ideally it will trade up

154
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,300
from 12 AM to 2 AM

155
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,020
that movement up is IPDA expanding the

156
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,120
range with a projectionary state or

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,740
sucking in buyers or squeezing on those

158
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,780
people that have stops just above the

159
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,280
marketplace they're already short

160
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,479
when the progress when the protraction a

161
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,699
stage or due to swing occurs we're

162
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,080
looking for one to two Standard

163
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,460
Deviation of the Central Bank dealer's

164
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,919
range if all these criterias are met and

165
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,360
then you end up nailing the high of the

166
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,520
day between two o'clock and four o'clock

167
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,319
in the morning typically

168
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,020
for your classic Sell profile London

169
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,740
normal protection

170
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,680
as an example this is what it would look

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,940
like

172
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,199
as you can see here we have a small

173
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,280
consolidation Asian range and we have an

174
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,919
immediately after midnight time frame

175
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,500
price goes straight up

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
and then from there creates the high

177
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,759
today and trades down

178
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
creating the LOD around the

179
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,419
monthly closed time period and then

180
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,639
coming off the low into consolidation

181
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,919
the projectionary stage is seen here

182
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,199
immediately after that midnight candle

183
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,039
okay intraday market profiles continue

184
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
to our Sell profile with London delayed

185
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,240
protraction

186
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,860
the market may or may not have a

187
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,720
favorable Central Bank dealer's range

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,819
that means it could be

189
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,580
an ideal stage set it could be less than

190
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,199
40 Pips or it could be greater than 40

191
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,379
Pips this profile can go either way when

192
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,580
we're using the Central Bank dealers

193
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,880
range

194
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,440
the DirectionalBias is going to be

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,020
bearish but the protractionary stage is

196
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,339
going to be delayed in the day in other

197
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,320
words we're not going to see the rally

198
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
right after

199
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,459
midnight in NewYork time it may just

200
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,860
erode and go lower right after midnight

201
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,440
IPDA will enter a protectionary stage at

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,980
or shortly after 2 AM NewYork so what

203
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,779
you're going to be doing is you have a

204
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,000
vertical line on your 15-minute time

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,940
frame and you're looking for price to

206
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,260
Stage a rally at or just shortly after 2

207
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,339
AM

208
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,860
that rally is going to be a intraday

209
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,660
inside the range it's already existing

210
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,640
or inside the the height it's already

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,959
formed for the day it's going to be

212
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,200
creating a smaller little Judas swing

213
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,820
it's going to Rally up from two o'clock

214
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,800
and making your

215
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,060
London entry comes in fruition

216
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,279
you'll be looking for an intraday

217
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,339
premium PD array to short on inside that

218
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,839
retracement now again that retracement

219
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,040
is going to occur at or just after 2 AM

220
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,080
when do you look for that when the

221
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,560
market does not create that 12 AM New

222
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,660
York time rally in other words the price

223
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,399
does not go into a pretractionary stage

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,339
higher after midnight it just rolls over

225
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,920
goes soft and this makes a progressively

226
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,860
lower move going into 2 AM not a

227
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,980
problem draw vertical line at 2 AM wait

228
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,860
for a retracement higher that will be if

229
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,720
this protractionary stage it will not

230
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,540
want to make a higher high and price

231
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,940
will go to a premium PD array bearish

232
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,980
order block close the fair value Gap or

233
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,899
liquidity void and then you'll be

234
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,459
selling short on the day and again the

235
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,380
primary premises is you already have to

236
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,660
have a bearish Outlook

237
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,920
the daily is respecting resistance ideas

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,779
and it should be seeking sell side

239
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,019
liquidity if you have this criteria this

240
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,700
is the London delayed protractionary

241
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,440
profile that you look to trade off of

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,899
but the key is having that two o'clock

243
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,680
time frame there must be a rally up at

244
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,160
or just after 2 AM trading up into a

245
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,500
premium PD array in the time frame

246
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,060
you're trading on which is the 15-minute

247
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,240
chart

248
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,800
an example that would be seen here

249
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,040
price rolls over just doesn't make any

250
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,060
higher high

251
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,220
then we have a protraction a stage rate

252
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,860
after two o'clock on this time frame

253
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,920
this is  seen with 70 Mt which would

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
be two o'clock in NewYork time price

255
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
creates a rally trades back up into a

256
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,519
bearish order block and then creates the

257
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,380
London session High trading lower

258
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,899
and you can see the projectionary stage

259
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,100
here

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,660
after 2 AM

261
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,839
okay intra market profiles continued now

262
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,180
we'll look at the buy profiles

263
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,920
now this is the one I like to trade when

264
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm looking to buy in the London session

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,940
this is the London normal protraction

266
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,220
stage CentralBankDealersRange again

267
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,079
is going to be less than 40 Pips

268
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,320
the Asian range is 20 to 30 Pips again a

269
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,100
narrow consolidation

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,440
the Market's going to decline lower

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
after 12 AM NewYork time into 2 AM

272
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,140
NewYork that's the fingerprint if you

273
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,940
will that if does doing what we're

274
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,079
outlining here in terms of

275
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,839
characteristics so if we do not see an

276
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,420
immediate decline from 12 AM NewYork

277
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,060
down into 2 AM NewYork

278
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,880
this is not going to be a London normal

279
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,200
protraction BuyDay

280
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,459
the projectionary stage or Judah swing

281
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,260
will be one to two StandardDeviation

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,700
of the Central Bank dealer's range

283
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,820
so what we're looking at here again

284
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,680
CentralBankDealersRange is going to

285
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
be less than 40 Pips

286
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,540
so they are consolidating the late New

287
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,600
York session going into Bond close

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,320
then an Asian range has a small narrow

289
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,600
20 to 30 pip range as well so they are

290
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,639
allowing orders to build up above and

291
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,040
below the marketplace

292
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,380
the market starts dropping immediately

293
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,560
after 12 AM NewYork time at midnight

294
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,160
and it trades lower down into 2 AM now

295
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,120
again the London low can form just ahead

296
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,980
of 2 AM but we're looking for a price

297
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,800
to be trending towards or making lower

298
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,660
lows going into that 2 AM time period

299
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,639
the market can start with an initial

300
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,160
move up very modest little move after 12

301
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,339
AM but it has to start trending lower

302
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,880
after 12 AM or shortly thereafter and

303
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
it has to consistently move lower past

304
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,660
ideally 1am 1 30 AM and right about

305
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,360
then you have a confirmation that the

306
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,940
London normal protraction by profile is

307
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,800
unfolding

308
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,899
you're gonna be looking for that Judas

309
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,459
swing or protractionary stage in the

310
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,800
marketplace to reach down one to two

311
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,779
StandardDeviation

312
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,760
in the CentralBankDealersRange and

313
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,779
that'll be your projected low

314
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,540
an example that is seen here

315
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,459
the market enters a small Central Bank

316
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,040
dealers range and Asian range is also a

317
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,600
respectable

318
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,180
range in terms of Pips

319
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,240
then price drops

320
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,180
lower right after

321
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,320
the midnight candle

322
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,440
finds the LOD and expands up

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,339
for higher close

324
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,320
as you can see here this is the

325
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,959
protraction stage

326
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,300
immediately after 12 AM NewYork time

327
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,100
okay intraday market profiles continuing

328
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,380
with our buy profile of the London

329
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,459
delayed protraction

330
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,540
for this we're going to be looking for

331
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,480
the market may or may not have a

332
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,220
favorable CentralBankDealersRange so

333
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,740
it can happen either or it can be in a

334
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,060
day where the CentralBankDealersRange

335
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,160
is less than 40 Pips or greater than 40

336
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,420
Pips the filter moves over to the Asian

337
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,820
range that is also a defining Factor it

338
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,579
helps build this a little bit more as a

339
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,620
favorable trading profile if the Asian

340
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,500
range creates a small range

341
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
but it's not necessary because the

342
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,420
profile could be seen with or without

343
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,060
the Asian range being in a range or the

344
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,800
Central Bank dealer's range being in a

345
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
small consolidation as well

346
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,660
main premise is the DirectionalBias is

347
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,120
bullish but the protraction is delayed

348
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,740
IPDA will enter a protraction stage at

349
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,720
or shortly after 2 AM NewYork

350
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,500
and you're gonna be looking for a

351
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,040
discount PD array to buy at during a

352
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,899
retracement that will occur

353
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,300
at or shortly after

354
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,420
2 AM NewYork time

355
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,519
so what are we saying here we have a

356
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,800
market that has a questionable Central

357
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,420
Bank dealers range that doesn't mean

358
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,699
that we just toss it out we have to look

359
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,440
at what's going on at midnight so we

360
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,940
have to get up or make ourselves

361
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,760
available at midnight and see okay we're

362
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,079
going to be looking for the

363
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,699
characteristics that's being described

364
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,860
here if we have wider than 40 Pips

365
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,779
CentralBankDealersRange okay then we

366
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,459
probably are going to be seeing a London

367
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,320
delayed protractionary stage

368
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,180
the DirectionalBias has to be clearly

369
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,199
bullish

370
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,540
and if we don't see the characteristics

371
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,779
that we saw for the London

372
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,300
protractionary Day for buy profile then

373
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,560
we have to look for these types of

374
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,019
things for the delay

375
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,940
so if it will enter a protractionary

376
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,399
stage at or shortly after 2 AM so what

377
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,740
we can do is if we see all those

378
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,260
indications are there at midnight we can

379
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,320
either take a nap or we can stay up and

380
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,680
wait to see if there's that delayed

381
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
protractionary stage or due to swing

382
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,220
that begins at 2 AM and will retrace

383
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,500
lower and it will seek a intraday

384
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,899
discount PD array

385
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,820
and you'll be buying that during that

386
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,320
retracement so basically it would be

387
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,820
like a classic intraday optimal trade

388
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,019
entry long

389
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,420
or a bowl of shoulder block closing in a

390
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,180
fair value Gap below market price or a

391
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,980
liquidity void

392
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,500
that movement lower

393
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,400
that will create that London entry for a

394
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,780
London delayed protractionary day

395
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,059
an example seen here the market starts

396
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,480
up and it doesn't give us a real clear

397
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,760
picture right away it starts moving

398
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,619
higher doesn't give us that big move

399
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,579
lower

400
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,340
or initial drop down so we have a

401
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,720
questionable

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,220
CentralBankDealersRange or agent

403
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,780
range scenario

404
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,299
we can be looking for

405
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,039
our DirectionalBias to unfold which is

406
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,080
a bullish day IPDA will enter a

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
processionary stage at or shortly after

408
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,220
2 AM NewYork that's the blue line here

409
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,340
Market drops down and dips into an

410
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,799
intraday discount PD array in this

411
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,179
example here you can see it trades down

412
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,520
into a previous down closed candle or

413
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,620
bowl of shorter block creating the

414
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,840
London setup to unfold for the rest of

415
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,460
the bullish close day

416
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,020
and the rest of the template is seen

417
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,600
here making the high today in

418
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,880
London close trading off of London to

419
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,140
close High

420
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,140
into consolidation for the daily close

421
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,820
so we have two dominant profiles that I

422
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,559
like to trade and look for the

423
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,419
characteristics are highly specific

424
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,400
they're not ambiguous

425
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,220
they have specific criteria that we look

426
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,179
for

427
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,299
if the first one which is the London

428
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,919
protraction whether it be buy or sell

429
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,320
profiles con characteristics are not

430
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,960
there then I look for justification for

431
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
the delay in the protractionary stages

432
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,460
of

433
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,179
the London session so the key is 2 AM

434
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,200
NewYork

435
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
so we're looking at 12 AM for a classic

436
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,740
London protraction or Judah swing

437
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,799
if we don't see that movement in favor

438
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,880
of our up close day with a down move

439
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,120
after 12 AM at due to swing lower if we

440
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,320
don't see that then we're going to be

441
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,919
looking for this scenario here 2 AM

442
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,500
so here's the criteria

443
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,780
you have to be up if you're going to be

444
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,760
a London Trader the ideal scenario is

445
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,039
you're going to be up at 12 AM

446
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,080
NewYork time

447
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,980
all the way up to at least in my opinion

448
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,460
2 30 AM to 3 AM that's the that's that

449
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,799
three hour window once you see what's

450
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,600
being outlined in both of these profiles

451
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,340
whether you're a buyer or seller I'm

452
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,860
only looking for four types of

453
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,960
conditions and I should already have

454
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,880
just two conditions set for London

455
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,559
either I'm going to be bullish or

456
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,940
bearish that's going to be this

457
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,860
determined by looking at the daily chart

458
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,679
and where are we trading off of recently

459
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,780
are we moving higher or lower if we're

460
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,460
going to be expanding higher then I'm

461
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,419
going to be looking for bullish

462
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,520
scenarios in London and I'm going to be

463
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,960
using the two criterias for the buy

464
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,640
profile either it's going to be a London

465
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,320
protraction or a London delayed

466
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,440
protraction day that's it nothing else

467
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,059
is slipping through the cracks nothing

468
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,919
else is going to surprise me I'm looking

469
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,660
for two criteria I'm looking for a

470
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,700
scenario to unfold at 12 AM going into

471
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,919
2 AM if that does not happen then I

472
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,299
know what I'm looking for at 2 AM I'm

473
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,780
looking for that delay of a Judah swing

474
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,340
the only difference is I'm going to be

475
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,900
either a buyer or seller based on my

476
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,000
HTF premise that's it

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,340
there's no magic to it than that I

478
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,380
understand that if they will do these

479
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,120
scenarios

480
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,880
and it'll also keep you out of Trades

481
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
there's going to be times where it won't

482
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,080
provide you an entry the market will

483
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
just probably keep on going up and it'll

484
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,280
probably be a 90 pip day it might be a

485
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,100
150 pip day and you aren't getting in

486
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,780
with either one of these profiles and

487
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,520
guess what that means that's a trade

488
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,559
that you missed you can send me emails

489
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,900
and complain about it I'm just telling

490
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,419
you some days I miss it too but by far

491
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,980
and large if you look for these two

492
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,020
characteristics for a buy or sell

493
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,080
profile intraday when you already have a

494
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,000
HTF notion that price

495
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,100
should be higher or lower based on that

496
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,660
daily chart

497
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,880
your criteria for trading the London

498
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,940
session is simple as this there's

499
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,799
nothing else that you're looking for

500
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,360
the framework we're going to give you

501
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,760
from the HTF down

502
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,820
obviously in later teaching but for here

503
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,100
you're only looking for two things a

504
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,440
movement after 12 AM going into two

505
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,000
o'clock in the morning and if that

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,740
doesn't happen then you draw a vertical

507
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,260
line at 2 AM then you expect it there so

508
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,200
between two o'clock and 3 AM that Judah

509
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,640
swing should occur

510
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,919
now think about I just told you I just

511
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,340
loaded your 50 caliber

512
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,740
Barrett ready to take down big game

513
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,039
you're able to find long and open setups

514
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,500
now with very specific criteria and

515
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,820
filters

516
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,500
go back and look at your old charts and

517
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,940
you'll see that these are going to be

518
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,880
the two dominant forces to outline all

519
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,919
of the best London open sessions until

520
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,360
next lesson I wish you good luck and

521
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,900
good Trading
