1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,340
welcome back folks this is April 2017's

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,859
content for the ICT mentorship

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,900
this month we're going to be teaching my

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,400
day trading model

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
this is lesson one

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,100
and we're going to be covering

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,900
Essentials to ICT day trading

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,159
all right folks  ICT day trading model

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,500
and the essentials to the ICT day

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,480
trading

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,180
okay for the opportunities inside the

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,700
DailyRange

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,800
now the aim is to capitalize on the

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,540
movement existing in a single day now

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,360
this makes this type of trading the

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,219
hardest and it's why most analysts and

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,399
Technical  gurus if you will that like

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,460
to talk on CNBC or in the higher time

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
frame World they'll they'll scoff at day

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
trading they'll say that it's not likely

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
that anyone could be profitable trading

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,299
this time frame but as you'll learn in

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,939
this month it's very very precise and

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,860
our aim is to capitalize on the movement

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,619
that exists in a 24-hour trading period

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,760
it's important just because the name

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,100
again I've said this many times is day

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
trading it does not mean or equate to

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,680
Everyday trading so not all dates are

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
going to be ideal for day trading

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,979
generally there are two setups per

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,080
trading day on average and we're going

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,840
to go over both of those setups but

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,740
we're gonna be talking about other

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,840
scenarios that can take place in a

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,340
24-hour trading period for this month

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,439
that will also help you when we get into

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,180
scalping in the May content

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,759
the DailyRange is the goal for us as

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,180
the day trader in other words our

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,500
expectation is to capitalize on at least

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,320
65 to 70 percent of the DailyRange that

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,399
means we're going to leave a little bit

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,920
on the table possibly near the high or

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,420
the LOD but we're trying to

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,399
get the lines portion of the move that

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,380
comprises the DailyRange or daily

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,979
candle

49
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,660
now typically the DailyRange will be

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,520
close to the last five days average

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,379
DailyRange and I'll go into detail

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,239
about that and how we can arrive at that

53
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,160
figure but generally what we're looking

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,739
for is a range that is equivalent to the

55
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,540
last five days averaged across in other

56
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,580
words what's the most Pips it's moved in

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,680
the last five days averaged and then

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,420
that's going to be our expected daily

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,560
range now there's going to be times

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
where I'm going to teach you where

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,459
average DailyRange can be actually

62
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,340
doubled or even expected to be more than

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,239
doubled in a single day

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
DirectionalBias frames a large portion

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,040
of all day trade setups

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,480
that means we're gonna be looking for

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,300
directional plays primarily so we're

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,580
going to have a preconceived idea going

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,260
into the week looking for specific

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,140
criterias to link ourselves with

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,280
institutional order flow

72
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,599
now the ideal scenario is to day trade

73
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,099
in the direction of the weekly time

74
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,720
frame I'm going to give you insights in

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
this specific teaching here how we can

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
do that

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,140
now the more HTF ideas

78
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,300
that you can find to support the day

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,940
trade this is going to increase the odds

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,200
and therefore make it better for you

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,500
a day trades permit the trader to limit

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,840
the stop loss on all trades now while

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,580
we're dealing specifically with day

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,940
trading in this entire month's content

85
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,860
the advantage is even if you do not want

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,260
to be a day trader or you don't have the

87
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,519
ability to sit in front of the charts

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,560
all day long and babysit there's going

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,299
to be a way of doing this type of

90
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,500
trading without sitting in front of the

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,540
charts all day I'll give you that but

92
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,060
also I want you to think about how using

93
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,739
day trade entries

94
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,840
and using the very small stop losses

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,700
that this time frame permits in this

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
discipline of trading you can lower your

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,040
initial risk when we're trading these

98
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,500
long-term position trades or swing

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,739
trades and or your one shot one kill

100
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,400
so these setups while they are really

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
limited to you by your own imagination

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,079
you can't

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,660
just look at this as a well it's a day

104
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,339
trading model or discipline so therefore

105
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,440
you know it doesn't fit me it doesn't

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,540
fit my criteria or my personal makeup as

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,300
a Trader it doesn't jive with my psyche

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,160
as an individual so therefore I mean

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,080
just just discount this and maybe you're

110
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,160
looking for something that's going to be

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
taught later in the mentorship and

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
you're not really going to pay too much

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
attention to this one  you'd be really

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,000
doing yourself at the same as a service

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,240
because it helps you reduce the amount

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,300
of risk lower the amount of Pips and

117
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
it's also going to have a framework

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
where you can incorporate with the last

119
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,580
lesson number eight of this month we can

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,380
incorporate the entry techniques that

121
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,240
we're using for day trading and then

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,100
overlap that with HTF

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,680
setups which can give you many many

124
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,960
times over the Standard three to five to

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,919
one

126
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,540
setups in other words we're looking for

127
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,699
setups that pay out five to one or three

128
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,280
to one ideally but

129
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
when you're using day trade entries and

130
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,880
you're high trading off a higher time

131
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,820
frame setup wow the multiples can be

132
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,860
ridiculous they could be in the double

133
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,120
digits very easily

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,380
it's important not to take many day

135
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,080
trades in a single 24-hour day and as I

136
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,759
mentioned earlier there's two primary

137
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,860
setups in a day and we're going to go

138
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,620
over that in the next teaching but for

139
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,479
now just understand that just because

140
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,419
you're day trading and we're not talking

141
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,620
about scalping here but we're looking

142
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,780
for specific setups that allow us to try

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,120
to capitalize on the majority of the

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,880
DailyRange now it's not important that

145
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
we get all the DailyRange believe me if

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
you get a portion of the DailyRange and

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
you go on the profit that's way better

148
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,699
than 99 of all the other Traders out

149
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,259
there because most people are losing

150
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,180
money so if you're capitalizing on a

151
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,320
DailyRange and you're getting some

152
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
portion of every single day that may

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,580
equate to maybe 30 Pips and maybe the

154
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,520
average DailyRange is 120 Pips and the

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,020
DailyRange for that particular day you

156
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,320
traded was 100 Pips but you only got 30

157
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,620
or maybe 40. that's not a loss that's

158
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,900
not a missed opportunity that's actually

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,840
very successful so you're doing well and

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,580
if you can continuously do that you'll

161
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,560
grow in your understanding and bring

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
yourself to holding for larger portions

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
of the move and getting in better

164
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,500
entries and you'll get larger portions

165
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
of that DailyRange but don't think that

166
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,940
you can day trade a lot and therefore

167
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,819
get a lot of Trades okay that's not the

168
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,500
answer to what you're looking for in

169
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,419
terms of profitability or Pips

170
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,100
now the if the data ranges combined with

171
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
PD arrays are the foundation to all of

172
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,819
my day trades

173
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,340
FOMC days and non-farm payroll days keep

174
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,440
us on the sidelines and they are

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
basically a no setup day so while we can

176
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
play in the sand and use our demo

177
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,919
accounts to keep close to price and stay

178
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,840
dialed in in terms of what they may be

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,660
reaching for as we just did just this

180
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,759
past Friday

181
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,120
week of this recording just because we

182
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,919
may be able to forecast or see

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,000
analytically where IPDA may take price

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,860
it's many times better just to sit on

185
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,660
the sidelines and just let that one day

186
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,660
go by without you participation in those

187
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,180
types of days really does not increase

188
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,400
your odds even in day trading

189
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
all right so what frames the daily

190
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
setups

191
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,660
obviously we have to concern ourselves

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,099
with HTF institutional

193
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,720
order flow and that's going to be a ride

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,699
that looking at monthly weekly and daily

195
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,440
PD arrays in the last 20 40 and 60

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
trading days

197
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm going to assume that you have a firm

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
understanding about what a PD array is

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,319
and looking back the last 20 40 and 60

200
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,319
trading days you have to look for those

201
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
HTF and we're going to

202
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,039
focus primarily on The Daily  for day

203
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,380
trades you don't need to see anything in

204
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,500
terms of a weekly or a monthly primarily

205
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,240
because you'll generally see something

206
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,460
on the daily that'll line up for a

207
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,319
discount or a premium PD array

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,840
now IPDA will be seeking new levels in

209
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,300
price for liquidity that's the role of

210
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,220
the interbank price delivery algorithm

211
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,860
it seeks to move price to an area of new

212
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,339
liquidity

213
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,740
the weekly chart or current candles

214
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,779
direction is what we're primarily

215
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,700
working within so what we're doing is

216
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,099
we're blending our expectation of what

217
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,779
IPDA may be seeking in terms of new

218
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,640
liquidity above or below us in terms of

219
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,959
market price

220
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,040
and we're forecasting the weekly candle

221
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,440
direction that we're presently trading

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
in so in other words if we're getting

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,380
ready to go into a new week we're going

224
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,940
to be forecasting what IPDA will be

225
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,560
reaching for higher or lower prices

226
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,040
relative terms to the PDA rays and in

227
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,899
the if the data ranges in order how far

228
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,180
back are we looking for the most

229
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,060
obvious logical premium or discount

230
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,120
array and what's the direction that's

231
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
most likely favoring higher or lower

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,980
prices and then we incorporate that idea

233
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,980
in forecasting the present or next

234
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,040
weekly candle and we look for that

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,260
expansion higher or lower in relative

236
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,540
terms to what we expect in terms of the

237
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,980
at the data range and institutional

238
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,399
order flow

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
the day of the week is Paramount and

240
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,360
understanding about day trading because

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,740
there's certain days that have high

242
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,899
probability and there's other days that

243
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,240
can be a little bit of a hat trick in

244
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,500
other words you may expect something to

245
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,019
happen this particular day but it may do

246
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,700
something entirely different and then

247
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,260
there's other days that are predisposed

248
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,420
to really just be a quiet day we'll talk

249
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,839
about that

250
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,360
and the most important is time of day

251
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,000
time of day for day trading is

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,980
absolutely Paramount just because we are

253
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,839
day trading doesn't mean that you can

254
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,339
just sit down any old time and say okay

255
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,839
I'm going to buy the Euro here and

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,279
therefore I'm going to be profitable or

257
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,980
I'm going to sell short the Euro Yen

258
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,019
because you know I got off work and I

259
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,640
can sit in front of charge now it does

260
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,500
not equate to that they are specific

261
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,839
times of the day that IPDA will move

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,060
price and gyrate price around and then

263
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,459
the market makers will facilitate trade

264
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,740
but at those particular times and there

265
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,760
are no set brokerage operating hours but

266
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
there are time windows that we have to

267
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,060
work within so while I don't trade in

268
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,779
zones in price I do trade in zones and

269
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,640
time so you have to be flexible with

270
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,480
time and demand specifics in price that

271
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,220
means we're demanding specific things

272
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,700
that occur in a window of time so the

273
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,220
flexibility resides in time not price

274
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,800
price must hit our level must go to our

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,320
level and we look for price to reach for

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320
that contrarian PD array for our profit

277
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,660
we do not wait

278
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,700
for price to get exactly to that level

279
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,260
because we're always going to look exit

280
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,540
early but we're always looking for these

281
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,180
x's and entries to overlap with specific

282
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,019
times of the day

283
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
and what we're primarily focusing on are

284
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,640
volatility expansions or large daily

285
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,420
ranges

286
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
okay time of day what time of day are we

287
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
referring to obviously if you've gone

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,279
through all my pre-dutorials in these

289
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,839
times that they aren't going to be new

290
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,820
to you but for completeness sake I do

291
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,519
have to incorporate them

292
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,500
primarily we're going to be looking for

293
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,980
day trades at the London session open

294
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,779
and that is basically the ICT killZone

295
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,720
for London and we're going to be talking

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
in terms of NewYork Times so when I

297
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,100
refer to a time here

298
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,079
it's going to be relative to what time

299
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,480
it is in NewYork

300
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,200
so typically London the hot spot for the

301
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,060
higher low the form for the day is

302
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,320
usually between two o'clock in the

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,519
morning and four o'clock in the morning

304
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,800
NewYork time now it can deviate and

305
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,839
transition a little bit earlier a little

306
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,120
bit later relative to the economic

307
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,600
calendar and or daylight savings time it

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
has a little bit of overlap where there

309
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,820
may be some transition time before the

310
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,160
market observes any movement from a

311
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,260
daylight savings time or not

312
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,720
in daylight savings time  the way I

313
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,540
overcome that is I look at my London

314
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,120
open killZone beginning at 1am NewYork

315
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
time and ending at 5 AM NewYork time

316
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,000
so it gives me that window of four hours

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,940
where it allows literally nothing to

318
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,100
escape me I'm looking already at that

319
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,899
time window and I'm looking at the

320
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,880
acting out calendar relative to the pair

321
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,279
I'm trading so there should be some kind

322
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,440
of a manipulation just before or at the

323
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,779
time of the news release that either is

324
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,880
medium impact or high impact and then

325
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,660
therefore the trade setup is seen the

326
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,240
next time window we look at is the New

327
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,100
York session open now this is primarily

328
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,440
the easiest one to work with

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
 you're gonna you're gonna see that

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,620
with the insights that you're gonna

331
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,660
learn in this particular teaching you'll

332
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,579
know why that the NewYork session

333
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,100
really really is so much easier and

334
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
that's why I worked primarily the

335
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,779
majority of our mentorship thus far in

336
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,120
the NewYork session because I want you

337
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,100
to get really friendly with that time

338
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,560
frame  you know London can be a little

339
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
bit of a beast so you have to know a

340
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,820
little bit more understanding about IPDA

341
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,220
how the DailyRange is formed within the

342
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,660
weekly range and in the weekly range

343
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,360
forms within a monthly range so all of

344
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,279
these fractal ideas they have to be

345
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,279
utilized in modular fashion and over a

346
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,540
period of time you'll get a better

347
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,639
understanding about how the sessions

348
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,519
unfold and when London is to be avoided

349
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,839
which we'll talk about this month but

350
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,620
NewYork primarily is really really good

351
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,240
now the only time that you would avoid

352
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,720
NewYork is if the London session puts

353
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,779
in 80 percent of the average DailyRange

354
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,800
and there's going to be very few times

355
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,260
that it does that but generally unless

356
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,480
they DailyRange is almost entirely

357
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,700
completed in the last five days average

358
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,940
DailyRange is what I'm referring to

359
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,399
that measurement if it's met or exceeded

360
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,800
in London that is when you want to move

361
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,240
to the sidelines and don't even consider

362
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,100
trading NewYork because it's probably

363
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,139
either going to bounce around go

364
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,660
sideways or it may catch you in a

365
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,579
reversal to you weren't expecting and

366
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,139
it's just better just to just sit on the

367
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,000
sidelines and don't worry about it wait

368
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,519
for another trading day

369
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,279
London close now I've taught London

370
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,980
close day trading strategy in the past I

371
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,839
used to do it I lost interest in it

372
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,040
because it just doesn't give me enough

373
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,120
of a payment if you will I'll touch

374
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
briefly on it this month but obviously I

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,740
have my own teaching on it where you can

376
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,120
watch that in my free tutorials but

377
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,279
nonetheless London close is the time of

378
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,019
day where we look to really Bank our

379
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,060
positions and

380
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,820
there are times when if the market is in

381
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,940
a reversal  intraday but it goes down

382
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,000
into a logical level of support or

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,199
trades up into electrical level

384
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,899
resistance that may be the very moment

385
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,639
in time that a reversal occurs London

386
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,339
close is not always just simply close

387
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:21,480
existing trades and move to the

388
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,220
sidelines many times London close can be

389
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,279
incorporated as a entry point for longer

390
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,320
term One-Shot one kill or

391
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,500
swing or position trades

392
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,600
foreign

393
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,459
close is basically just a Time window

394
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,160
what we're looking for is  the two

395
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,019
o'clock hour now

396
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,339
I'm not going to  argue that everyone

397
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,480
else around the world is going to say

398
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,399
NewYork is you know later in the day

399
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,860
than that  I'll leave everyone else to

400
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,060
believe whatever they want to believe

401
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
but what we're looking at is the two

402
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,720
o'clock hour and specifically the three

403
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,420
o'clock which is the close of the bond

404
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,240
market that to me is the close of the

405
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,300
NewYork session so what we look for is

406
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,240
in days to have FOMC interest rate stuff

407
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,279
that comes out at two o'clock hour in

408
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,440
NewYork time that usually will run

409
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,579
until around three o'clock in the

410
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,620
afternoon NewYork time and then when

411
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,480
the bond market closes at 3 PM that's

412
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,000
it whatever's happened by then that's

413
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,380
the DailyRange and there's nothing else

414
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,000
to expect

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,160
very very rarely are we even concerned

416
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,860
about that because generally by noon

417
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,779
 you're you're done you're not really

418
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,079
looking at anything past noon

419
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,959
Asian session open  this is primarily

420
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,620
8 PM  my time in NewYork  we're

421
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,600
looking for very small little setups

422
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
that takes place in  this time of day

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,820
but many times  during the Aussie

424
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,459
overlap into Asia you can actually get

425
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,759
the daily lower high formed  in the

426
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,220
Asian session open for like the Yen

427
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,459
pairs  Aussie and kiwi those types of

428
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,740
pairs can generally

429
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,180
surprise the traitor by forming a

430
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,359
special or important if you will high or

431
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,400
low at that time of day when you would

432
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
normally expect it in the London session

433
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,780
those pairs generally can have a

434
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,880
surprise and form their particular daily

435
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,179
low and respective low at that session

436
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,459
time

437
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,260
and London lunch this is generally

438
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,319
between 5 AM to 7

439
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,900
00 AM that time window is when the

440
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,720
market goes pretty much quiet and It

441
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,299
prepares for the next leg either in the

442
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,960
direction that London creates or a

443
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,140
reversal and on days that don't promote

444
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,360
anymore follow through it can just be a

445
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,039
continuation rate from London and goes

446
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,080
right on through the NewYork session in

447
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,039
consolidation so London after 5 P AM

448
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,919
NewYork time you generally want to just

449
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,520
anticipate a mode of transition

450
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,000
retracement or consolidation so if we're

451
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
for instance if we're looking for lower

452
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
prices and we've gone short in London

453
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,820
it's pretty good idea to take something

454
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,960
at or just before 5 AM just in case we

455
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,880
get a reversal because there can be

456
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,220
London lunch reversals

457
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,500
and because there's usually an economic

458
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
report that comes out late like 4 30 in

459
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,340
the morning my time or it could be a 5

460
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,980
AM release economically but nonetheless

461
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,020
you want to take something

462
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,700
during the London session in terms of

463
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,580
profit because the London lunch hour can

464
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,299
cause a reversal or a deeper retracement

465
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,160
that may squeeze on your profits and

466
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
depend upon how far that retracement

467
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,720
goes and some of them in London can be

468
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,080
brutal  you don't want to get

469
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,140
the opportunity to pass you by where a

470
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,179
good position except would have been

471
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,100
favorable for at least a portion of your

472
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,799
trade so be mindful that between 5 AM

473
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
and 7 AM that is considered another

474
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
lunch and we look for either retracement

475
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,299
or consolidation on that particular time

476
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,600
of day

477
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,679
okay day of week I'm gonna give you some

478
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,960
characteristic specifics about  each

479
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,840
day and Sunday generally we opt out

480
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,700
because the DailyRange is simply too

481
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,919
too small it's only a couple hours but

482
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,480
there are some things that we need to

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,280
know about Sunday for those data

484
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,100
providers that use daily  Sunday

485
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,980
candles some provider some Brokers don't

486
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,220
use Sunday at all but if it if your

487
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,620
broker doesn't use Sunday

488
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,299
 don't worry about it just use

489
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,340
everything that we teach and I'll refer

490
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,720
to later on and we get to that

491
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,580
discussion about what we do with Sunday

492
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,980
 you just incorporate that with

493
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,020
Monday's data it's not that big of a

494
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,140
deal

495
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,280
okay Monday and generally this can

496
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,860
create a small range typically

497
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,620
um if it's a really large range

498
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,960
and it comes right out the gate  you

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
know Direction wise and you understand

500
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,860
where you're at in terms of the the PD

501
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,840
arrays if we're trading up into a

502
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,600
premium right from the jump of the new

503
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
week and Monday becomes a high range or

504
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,100
large range day and it trades into a

505
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,220
premium PD array that can many times be

506
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,140
the high of the week that's the

507
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,640
characteristics that we look for so

508
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,780
that's kind of like a tip that we can

509
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,299
add to back  the one shot one kill

510
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,480
content if Monday is a big range day

511
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,940
and we trade up into a premium relative

512
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,260
to the Daily

513
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,799
then we can really anticipate that being

514
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,240
the high of the week

515
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,520
now generally Mondays are going to be a

516
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,260
small range day unless that type of

517
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,240
scenario unfolds or the opposite would

518
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,220
be if Monday has a big range day and

519
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,880
trading down and it goes into a PD array

520
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,919
that's a discount on the daily chart

521
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,080
then we can anticipate Monday becoming

522
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,220
the lowest low of the week

523
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,700
Tuesday usually is a good day to trade

524
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,440
in terms of specifics of one shot one

525
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,559
kill usually on bullish weeks Tuesday

526
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,340
has a 77 likelihood of creating the low

527
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,160
of the week in London and therefore it

528
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,440
creates a high probability  scenario

529
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,080
to be a day trader on Tuesdays and

530
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,820
reverse is said for when the markets are

531
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,679
bearish if you have a 70 likelihood that

532
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,360
Tuesday's limit open will create the

533
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,340
high of the week so generally Tuesdays

534
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,260
are really good days to trade for day

535
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,059
trades

536
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,120
Wednesday are really ideal scenarios

537
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
because what you'll see is you have

538
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,679
Sunday if you use those candles in your

539
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,700
platform

540
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,799
Monday and Tuesday or if you don't have

541
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,820
Sunday you have Monday and Tuesday

542
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,919
behind you and it gives you some insight

543
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,299
as we're going to share in this teaching

544
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,780
to help frame confidence around trading

545
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,640
Wednesday with a particular mindset

546
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,679
going into London and NewYork so

547
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,440
generally ideal day trading is seen on

548
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,700
Wednesday because you have some data

549
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,100
midweek

550
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,380
Thursday again is generally ideal

551
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,960
scenario but you gotta be careful

552
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,580
Thursdays can reverse

553
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,520
um usually the weekly range is again

554
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,640
capped by Thursday's NewYork session so

555
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,620
be mindful that if we do get a good day

556
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,620
trade in in Thursday's London open

557
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,140
it may fizzle out and actually reverse

558
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,820
the week

559
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,280
during the Thursday NewYork or London

560
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,059
close scenario

561
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,460
Friday is typically a small range as we

562
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,220
close a week but if there are objectives

563
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,740
that haven't been met by Thursday in

564
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,220
terms of the PD arrays you could see a

565
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,260
surprise expansion on Friday running

566
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,960
into that PD array so it's kind of like

567
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,179
a toss-up it depends on what we've seen

568
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,580
in the weekly range if Thursday has met

569
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,919
the daily PD array whether it be premium

570
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,539
or discount that we've traded for in

571
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,039
terms of a Target

572
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,039
for the weekly range as a whole if

573
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,840
that's been met by Thursday chances are

574
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,240
Friday's going to be a really quiet day

575
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,400
if it has not been met Friday can

576
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,140
generally sometimes surprise us and have

577
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,400
a big large range day

578
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,480
the weekly range framework

579
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,600
okay what we look for is on Sunday we

580
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
determine the new trading week's opening

581
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,460
price now this will Aid Us in intra week

582
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,380
with day trade directional buys to work

583
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,940
with now I already know some of you are

584
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,580
thinking and panicking oh no you know I

585
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,440
don't use Sunday candles my broker

586
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,140
doesn't use Sunday data no problem just

587
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,419
use your opening on Monday it's not that

588
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,039
big of a deal it's still going to come

589
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,200
to the same consensus anyway to just

590
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,120
relax it's not going to be that much of

591
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,280
a disparity

592
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,140
but we're going to note this Sunday

593
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,059
opening and we're going to note it and

594
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,159
draw it out in time all the way through

595
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
our 60 Minute or one hour chart all the

596
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,640
way up to Thursday

597
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,159
now the weekly range framework what we

598
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,260
do with this is we take that opening

599
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,900
range price

600
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,720
from Sunday and we draw it out on our

601
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,520
hourly chart and we draw it all the way

602
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,100
until Thursday now why is it Thursday

603
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,080
well because your profile say on

604
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,539
Thursday you could see a reversal unfold

605
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,799
for the week

606
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,320
so while we do have some rules that

607
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,400
we're going to be sharing with you here

608
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,640
Thursday May change that entirely and

609
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,820
it'll also frame a high

610
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,120
probability reversal confirmation if you

611
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,400
will if price gets back above and when

612
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,840
it's bearish like for instance look at

613
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,520
this chart here if price were to trade

614
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,080
back above the opening price on Sunday

615
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,240
during Thursday's Trading

616
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
we've probably turned the corner we've

617
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,159
had a major intro week reversal and that

618
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,620
many times indicates a longer term

619
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,080
One-Shot one kill bullish so we could

620
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,299
get in sync with that if not the next

621
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,580
day and Friday we can certainly be in

622
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,640
sync with it the next trading week so

623
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,039
think about that in terms of intra-week

624
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,240
reversals

625
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,419
if we see it trade back above

626
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,220
well in this case since it was bearish

627
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,740
for the week if we trade above Sunday's

628
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,360
opening on Thursday we've had an

629
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
intra-week reversal and obviously that

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,900
goes without saying it's pretty obvious

631
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,460
and some of you that are very cynical

632
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,020
would say well good grief that's the

633
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,580
obvious Michael but think about what

634
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,500
it's telling you you've had a

635
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,260
intermediate term reversal

636
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,140
so now therefore Friday May not give you

637
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,320
a setup to trade long but next week you

638
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,779
can you can trade long on Monday right

639
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,120
out the gate looking for a low in New

640
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,620
York and London

641
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,720
they get along and take those positions

642
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,940
throughout the rest of the next week if

643
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,039
this scenario was reversed and we had

644
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,419
Sunday's opening

645
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,520
 forecast all the way and drawn

646
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,140
through our hourly chart all the way to

647
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,159
Thursday

648
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,440
and it started bullish for the week and

649
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,480
then traded down Thursday

650
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,720
through that Sunday's opening price that

651
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,059
registers a potential weekly reversal so

652
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,340
therefore we can get in sync the very

653
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,980
next day on Friday selling short or the

654
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,539
next week our scenario would go into

655
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,179
that new week going short rate from jump

656
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,980
on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday looking

657
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,480
for the high of the week to form and

658
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,820
then therefore going short every day in

659
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,820
the following week based on the insight

660
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,460
but the suddenly opening price filter we

661
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,559
look for price to trade Above This level

662
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,200
generally early in the week during

663
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
bearish weekly DirectionalBias in other

664
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,179
words we're expecting price to trade

665
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,039
down away from a PD array that's a

666
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,260
premium okay we've seen price move up

667
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,000
into a premium it's already traded it

668
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
has already fulfilled a premium level so

669
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
therefore we're expecting expansion on

670
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
the downside and we see the opening

671
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,279
price and then price starts to trade up

672
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,500
Sunday and going into Monday trades

673
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,760
above it so therefore we're seeing a

674
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,220
little bit of a Judas swing that's the

675
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,600
criteria we're looking for and then

676
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,820
throughout the rest of the week as long

677
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,860
as price is lower than this Sunday

678
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,960
opening price each day of the week we

679
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,940
look to sell short in all of our day

680
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,340
trades

681
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,779
caveat is

682
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,480
until a HTF PD array

683
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
that's contrary to how our trade is

684
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,220
unfolding is traded to in other words if

685
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,260
we're looking for bearish ideas

686
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,299
okay directional lies we're expecting

687
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,000
the weekly candle to be closing lower

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,340
than it opened on Sunday

689
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,500
no it's the weekly candle closing Friday

690
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,720
will close lower than it opened on

691
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,760
Sundays opening or if your data provider

692
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,380
opens on Monday

693
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,240
if we're expecting that down candle on a

694
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,740
weekly basis

695
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,100
as long as we are trading below the

696
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,960
Sunday's opening price

697
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,059
we're looking to sell short every single

698
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,880
day in London and continuation in New

699
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,640
York but this is only true in this case

700
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,919
while we're looking for Sell days every

701
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,659
day of the week while we're below the

702
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,700
Sunday opening price

703
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,919
that's true only until we trade to a

704
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,980
HTF discount PD array that

705
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,799
has us on caution and we may see an

706
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,179
intro week reversal if that happens

707
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,760
otherwise we continuously take day

708
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,679
trades short in London and continuations

709
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,279
in NewYork

710
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,299
can't continue with the weekly range

711
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,260
framework

712
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,600
the opposite said here for Sunday's

713
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,100
opening price filter

714
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,559
we look for price to trade below this

715
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,659
level early in the week during bullish

716
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,520
weekly DirectionalBias in other words

717
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,380
if price is trading at a higher time

718
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,860
frame discount PD array whether it be a

719
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,260
monthly weekly and daily there's

720
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,240
suggestions that you know the prices

721
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,480
really oversold institutionally speaking

722
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,700
not because of indicators but in

723
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,320
relative terms if we expect something to

724
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
to be bullish on a daily chart that's

725
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,039
really the only thing we really need if

726
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,900
the daily is at a discount and we're

727
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,299
trading at a discount PD array price is

728
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,279
suggesting higher prices institutional

729
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,799
order flow suggesting higher prices

730
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,840
we've gone to forecast the weekly candle

731
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,500
to close higher than it opens on Sunday

732
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,080
as long as price is higher than this

733
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,760
Sunday opening price each day of the

734
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,400
week we look to buy long in all of our

735
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
day trades that means we're looking for

736
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,960
the low the form in London and a

737
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,020
continuation by in NewYork and we

738
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,419
continuously hold this idea throughout

739
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,299
the week until a HTF PD

740
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,940
array in the form of a premium is traded

741
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,720
to

742
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,640
then we would expect a potential

743
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,919
intra-week reversal

744
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,899
so I know it's just probably you know

745
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,240
going way past your heads and it's going

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,760
a lot of information because many of you

747
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,279
probably shortchange yourself studying

748
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,799
the previous lessons I'm going to give

749
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,000
you a few examples we're going to look

750
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,559
back at the cable over the last three

751
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,179
weeks and give you some scenarios and

752
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,340
what this did and how it helps

753
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
okay so we're looking at a British pound

754
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,039
USD weekly chart so every range here

755
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,880
represents a weekly amount of data in

756
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
other words it's the Open high low and

757
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,500
close of an entire week

758
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,600
I want you to focus primarily at this

759
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,940
chart and think about Power3 I've

760
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,200
gone through my free tutorials you

761
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,539
understand what Power3 is but I

762
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,100
want you to look at these candles and

763
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,899
remind yourself that the weekly range

764
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,659
candles that are large have the opening

765
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,179
price and closing price at opposing ends

766
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,100
of the Candlestick range

767
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,440
now this is important because it's

768
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,720
teaching you to focus and anticipate

769
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,840
range expansion range expansion on a

770
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840
weekly chart is a gold mine as long as

771
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,820
you know what the most likely probable

772
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,220
Direction is on the weekly candle that

773
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,140
we're forming right now

774
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,500
you can find setups you don't have to

775
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,299
worry about missing anything because

776
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,240
last time I checked there's every new

777
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,520
week There's a new candle forming on a

778
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,140
weekly basis so there's new setups to

779
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,120
form now some weeks are better than

780
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,860
others you're going to be small weeks

781
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,679
there's going to be Wick real high Wick

782
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,539
real low candles and then creating a

783
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,760
small little body those leaks can be

784
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,380
challenging sometimes but there's other

785
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,419
times when the when the candle itself is

786
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,460
rather small and

787
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,320
you're not going to make money every

788
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,659
single week every single day every

789
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,399
single month that is not going to happen

790
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,200
even with my content because you're

791
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,520
going to do something to break the rules

792
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,620
or the markets is simply not going to do

793
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,380
what you hoped it was going to do but on

794
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,860
a large scale probability Spectrum you

795
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,260
have more odds of finding opportunities

796
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,720
using this criteria than in any other

797
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,340
fashion no other discipline out there

798
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,440
gives you this Focus point to work

799
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,799
within

800
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,380
so now looking at this weekly chart

801
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,600
we're going to look at a bullish candle

802
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,340
okay and what we're focusing on

803
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,159
primarily is that the open is usually

804
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,559
near the low of the week

805
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,080
and the close is near the high of the

806
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,159
week now let's think about this in

807
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,500
relative terms it's a weekly candle so

808
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,600
therefore the open is Sunday's opening

809
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,380
or if your data is only providing Monday

810
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,539
not Sunday candles it's going to be the

811
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,700
Monday opening okay so what we're

812
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,020
looking for is that a little bit of

813
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
movement below the opening price when

814
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,860
we're primarily bullish and then we're

815
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,940
going to be looking for expansion

816
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,140
throughout the rest of the week until

817
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,820
Friday's close

818
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,520
all the way between the open and close

819
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,500
that's your range that you're working

820
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,299
within now I know what you're thinking

821
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,279
how do I know how far away the close is

822
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,860
going to be there's calculations and

823
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,760
things I'm going to give you to

824
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,559
determine what the weekly range may be

825
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,820
and there's going to be things you have

826
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,919
to overlap with that in terms of if the

827
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,760
data ranges and PD arrays but between

828
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,200
this lesson and what you learn in later

829
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,480
lessons just for now focus on the

830
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,419
fundamentals of knowing that there's a

831
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,700
large range based on the weekly candle

832
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,100
that ranges between the opening on

833
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,960
Sunday or your data provider only

834
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,840
opening on Monday that opening price to

835
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,059
Friday's close that's your time window

836
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,279
we're looking for day trades throughout

837
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,140
the week Monday through Friday we have

838
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,580
five opportunities and if we're going to

839
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,399
be fair about it we generally have

840
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,740
basically  nine setups that are pretty

841
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,419
much solid we generally don't rush a

842
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,120
London setup on Monday but if you're

843
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,740
absolutely aggressive you can be looking

844
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,299
for setups on Monday especially if you

845
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,220
have a big range starting right out of

846
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,740
the gate on Sunday going into Monday 

847
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Frankfurt so if that happens then that's

848
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,899
pretty much a a sure deal that you

849
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,240
should be paying attention to London on

850
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,980
Monday so you still have to be paying

851
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,480
attention to it so regardless of where

852
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,059
you live in the world around midnight in

853
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,240
NewYork time on Monday you need to be

854
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,380
looking at the charts and see how big

855
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,899
the range was for Asia on Monday's

856
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,240
trading so from Sunday's opening all

857
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,559
into Frankfurt set up you know what that

858
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,260
looks like by looking at midnight and

859
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,659
Monday morning NewYork time and if it's

860
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,640
a big range then you primarily want to

861
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,399
look for the weekly high or low to form

862
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,620
on Monday because it's in a rush to get

863
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,179
somewhere in a hurry if you look at the

864
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,740
daily chart many times it's going to

865
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,840
line up with a premium or a discount

866
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,640
array and you can pretty much know what

867
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,720
they're going to probably do the rest of

868
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
the week

869
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,640
and the same thing in Reverse terms

870
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,340
looking at a down candle for the week

871
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,860
we're looking primarily from the open at

872
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,899
the beginning we get Sunday or again if

873
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,219
you don't have so many candles in your

874
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,540
platform we're looking at the opening

875
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,639
price on your Monday feed

876
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,800
to Friday's close that's the range

877
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,000
you're operating in so you're looking

878
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,580
for shorts in this scenario every day

879
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,260
looking for shorts as long as we're

880
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,899
below that opening price formed at

881
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:25,139
Sunday or Monday that filter gives you

882
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,540
focus to look for now again we don't

883
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,060
just simply go and look at just because

884
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,480
for instance Tuesdays long and open may

885
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,000
be lower okay it may be lower than

886
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,760
Sunday's opening price in Tuesday's

887
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,099
London open so that does not mean simply

888
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,659
go in there and start going short

889
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,300
because I just said something in general

890
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,159
terms like that no we're going to show

891
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,679
you in three examples of what can happen

892
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,139
and why that isn't always that simple

893
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,659
you have to look at again the PD arrays

894
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,280
and The pdra Matrix

895
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,020
okay our first and three examples here

896
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,320
we're looking at the daily chart of the

897
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,040
pound

898
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,339
and this is illustrating a

899
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,160
premium PD array on the daily chart in

900
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,500
the form of a daily rejection block

901
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,599
okay and an old low discount PD array so

902
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,339
we have two reference points framed here

903
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,800
and we're going to look at the week of

904
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,640
this recording

905
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
okay you can see all of the days for

906
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,520
this particular week are noted and our

907
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,740
opening prices forecasted throughout the

908
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,839
week until Thursday Thursday has a

909
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,579
delineation so you can see the

910
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,380
separation amongst all the other days

911
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,660
Monday Tuesday Wednesday and then Friday

912
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,339
you can see that we had that daily

913
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,820
rejection block premium PD array

914
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,640
traded to and above the opening price on

915
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,720
Sunday

916
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,140
and price started trading softer right

917
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,260
away on Monday trading lower now on

918
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,700
Tuesday okay we had Pro sell off right

919
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,400
after the transition from Monday into

920
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,079
Tuesday it sold off then went in

921
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,220
consolidation

922
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,220
in a consolidation continued all the way

923
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,300
into

924
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,140
the London open for Wednesday and then

925
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,300
price rallied again now think about

926
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,579
what's happened here on Wednesday

927
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,839
Tuesday and Wednesday price had traded

928
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,020
down into a fair value Gap so we had Gap

929
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,700
support and you can see that Gap really

930
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,339
being noted here on the previous week

931
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,260
but we'll look at that week after this

932
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,640
one but

933
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,920
price traded down and found support and

934
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,320
couldn't find its way below 124.30

935
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,200
Tuesday and Wednesday finally it rallied

936
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,980
up

937
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,500
creating another consolidation and then

938
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,339
Thursday it trades up intraday

939
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,339
creating a high that's higher than the

940
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,960
consolidation that was formed in

941
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,780
Wednesday then it was rejected and then

942
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,820
we sold off

943
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,700
on non-farm payroll on Friday

944
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
the general consensus is that we were

945
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,099
looking for cells below that opening

946
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,560
price on Sunday because it had traded

947
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,800
into the daily rejection block PD array

948
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,420
in a premium basis

949
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,760
this is the reason why I gave you 

950
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,920
short objectives of 12420

951
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,200
123.75 and then 123.10

952
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,800
12310 didn't get traded to but 123.75

953
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,839
did and we had a low of the week of

954
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,480
123.65

955
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
and that's 10 Pips below the low that

956
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,540
formed for this old low discount PD

957
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,900
array

958
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,060
okay our second scenario or example for

959
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,260
case study

960
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,480
we have a daily rejection block premium

961
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,119
PD array and we have a bullish order

962
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,400
block low discount PD array

963
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,180
okay on the previous week prior to the

964
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,040
week of this recording

965
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,480
okay you can see the opening price on

966
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,760
Sunday and right away price shoots out

967
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,680
the gate on Monday trades up

968
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,560
aggressively trades higher

969
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,079
and then sells off again in

970
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,900
London on Tuesday

971
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,820
and then trades down through that

972
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,880
opening price now watch what happens on

973
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,079
Wednesday

974
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,020
the the Mantra would be okay we're below

975
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,599
the selling point of Sunday's opening

976
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,640
price so therefore I should be looking

977
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,560
to sell short because we're below

978
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,619
Sunday's opening price no the reason why

979
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,180
is because we traded down into a fair

980
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,740
value Gap relative to the daily chart

981
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,619
and we have that daily discount bullish

982
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,420
order block see how it stopped it dead

983
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,640
in its tracks so while we're still below

984
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,140
the opening price

985
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,240
and we hit a PD array in a discount

986
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,760
contrarian scale in order we're looking

987
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,560
at something that would be opposing our

988
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,599
expectations on Lower pricing

989
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,480
if we're at a discount on The Daily

990
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,960
if it hits that we have to look at what

991
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
that PD array is is it premium or or

992
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,460
discount in this case it's discount so

993
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,040
therefore it's going to offer support we

994
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,140
cannot be a seller in this

995
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,780
particular setup we anticipate what

996
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,940
unfolding it's a reversal

997
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,579
so we have Wednesday's profile Wednesday

998
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,859
reversal or low of the week form and

999
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,020
then we can change gears and forget the

1000
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,760
Sunday's opening price and we're going

1001
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
to focus primarily on the weekly profile

1002
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,500
and we transition from that now we're

1003
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,839
going to incorporate the weekly profile

1004
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,060
of Wednesday low of the week so you can

1005
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,099
see the low forming at that PDA rate

1006
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,099
discount on a daily basis with the order

1007
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,400
Block in London on Wednesday it trades

1008
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,380
down and then on Thursday it trades down

1009
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,320
into that fair value a gap

1010
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,839
also a discount PD array and then

1011
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,119
expands up above the opening price

1012
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,040
that's seen on Sunday

1013
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,400
and then on Friday it opens and trades

1014
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,680
down again into

1015
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,599
a bullish order block that was seen on

1016
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,579
Thursdays trading and then it expands up

1017
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,220
against once more closing in the

1018
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,079
liquidity void

1019
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,020
formed on Tuesday's Trading

1020
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,300
so you can see how it's just simply not

1021
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,579
watch a video from ICT and there it is

1022
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:22,619
it's as simple as that you have to blend

1023
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,960
some things and look at what would be

1024
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,060
barriers what are what are the barriers

1025
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,820
or speed bumps to you getting to what

1026
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,680
you think price is going to do because

1027
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,720
we understand if the data ranges looking

1028
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,420
back 20 40 and 60 days we understand the

1029
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,020
PD array Matrix what makes a premium

1030
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,940
array what makes a discount array and

1031
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,000
where we're at in that scheme of the

1032
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,640
Matrix are we above or below equilibrium

1033
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,680
in this case when price traded down

1034
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,300
Wednesday into that daily discount

1035
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,520
bullish order block you can't just

1036
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,839
simply say I'm going to go sell them

1037
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,020
short because it rallied up in London

1038
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,400
it's sold off a little bit but traded

1039
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,780
down to that bullish order block inside

1040
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,119
the fair value Gap these are all daily

1041
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,720
PD arrays in the discount manner so if

1042
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,820
it's discounted it's trading at a daily

1043
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,820
chart it's going to resist going lower

1044
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,220
but it will paint all kinds of scenarios

1045
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,440
that would look like Sell setups in the

1046
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,720
retail Spectrum and then all of a sudden

1047
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,640
you see the market trading higher and it

1048
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,579
goes up into its respective contrary

1049
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,300
discount PD array in this case it's the

1050
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,480
Tuesday liquidity void being closed in a

1051
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,900
fair value Gap up at the 125 50 level

1052
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,400
okay our last example here

1053
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,740
we have the bullish order block low

1054
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,099
discount PD array and we have an old

1055
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,920
high or equal highs premium PD array

1056
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,339
okay and we have the opening price on

1057
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,380
this particular week's Sunday's opening

1058
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,960
and price trades right from the opening

1059
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,780
it goes up a little bit on Monday and

1060
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,020
trades down right away into the bullish

1061
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,780
order block low discount PD array and

1062
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,520
then rallies away from that and then we

1063
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,079
have one more attempt to go lower on

1064
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,780
Tuesday trades down into it

1065
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,420
Tuesday and then expands up so now

1066
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,300
Tuesday we've traded above Sunday's

1067
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,260
opening we are at a discount on The

1068
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,420
Daily so therefore we have our scenario

1069
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,000
expecting the weekly range or candle to

1070
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,579
close higher than it opened on Sunday so

1071
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,400
therefore our Mantra is every day we're

1072
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,339
looking for an open decline low of the

1073
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,500
day buy it in London

1074
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,119
in NewYork we're looking for

1075
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,760
retracement into the range that was

1076
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,220
created from London's low to the high

1077
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,380
formed prior to 8 20 8 30 AM in that in

1078
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,780
that realm  we're looking for that CME

1079
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,440
opening which is 8 20 AM NewYork time

1080
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,060
when that occurs generally that's going

1081
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,220
to be the setup in NewYork and so

1082
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,740
usually a continuation therefore and

1083
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,520
we're going to be looking for an

1084
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,920
expansion continuing on the up move so

1085
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,460
we have the criteria met with a discount

1086
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,040
PD array on The Daily being met will

1087
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,380
Monday's Trading if we trade above

1088
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,720
Sunday's opening price on Tuesday so

1089
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,359
therefore Wednesday Thursday we're

1090
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,359
looking for openings in London to trade

1091
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,480
down by at a logical discount PD array

1092
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,819
in its lower time frame hourly chart

1093
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,619
and

1094
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:34,319
look what happens on Friday the criteria

1095
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,460
says that Friday can be a quiet day and

1096
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,859
the weekly range can be capped by

1097
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,800
Thursday's trading in NewYork and you

1098
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,339
see that happens here

1099
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:49,440
notice also because we did not hit the

1100
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,240
old high or equal High

1101
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,240
premium PD array that particular week on

1102
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
the 24th of

1103
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,220
march on Sunday we opened up

1104
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,380
rallying right away and it makes a run

1105
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,079
for what the daily PD array equal highs

1106
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,020
once it hit those equal highs then on

1107
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,480
Tuesday we see the week that we just

1108
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,220
talked about it creates that failure

1109
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,099
swing around that

1110
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,720
125-90 level creating the high of the

1111
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,520
week on Tuesday so there's that overlap

1112
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,980
of PD arrays that caused the previous

1113
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,619
examples weekly High the form on Monday

1114
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,060
and Tuesday

1115
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,400
so you have to blend some things but

1116
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,079
incorporating the Sunday's opening price

1117
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,200
and blending it with PD arrays from a

1118
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,020
discount and premium basis on a daily

1119
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,500
chart you can frame out what the weekly

1120
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,619
range will be this assists you also with

1121
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,420
one shot one kill

1122
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,640
but more importantly it helps us frame

1123
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,079
whether we're going to be a buyer or

1124
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,599
seller each day as a day trader and if

1125
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,520
that condition is really there if we

1126
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,220
don't get the open and decline

1127
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,500
in London that we're looking for to be a

1128
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,540
buyer and say this rallies we don't do

1129
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,640
anything with it or if it trades down

1130
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,099
later in the day in NewYork we can be a

1131
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,599
buyer in NewYork and then look for that

1132
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,700
expansion on the upside one more bullish

1133
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,260
so hopefully this has been in cycle T

1134
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,520
we're going to build a lot more on this

1135
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,200
information throughout this month and

1136
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,760
give you a lot more details and and

1137
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,099
processes that you go through but this

1138
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,619
is a strong Foundation it helps fill in

1139
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,440
a lot of gaps from my day trading and

1140
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,300
intraday stuff and Power3 and

1141
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,560
especially with the one shot one kill

1142
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,619
setups that you learned  about in the

1143
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,319
previous month in March

1144
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,700
but

1145
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,560
it's important that it's simply you

1146
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,640
don't look at the opening price on

1147
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,619
Sunday and therefore it's above or below

1148
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,240
so I'm going to just do that no you have

1149
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,520
to incorporate the PD arrays and again

1150
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,859
this is the reason why it's not just

1151
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,900
simply watch a video and do it you have

1152
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,300
to study you have to have these things

1153
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,339
on your chart know what they are

1154
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,440
identify them label them on your chart

1155
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,780
and when it's traded to you anticipate

1156
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,359
specific things to unfold IPDA will move

1157
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,000
from one PD array to the next from a

1158
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,339
discount to a premium from a premium to

1159
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,260
a discount and knowing what they are on

1160
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,599
a daily chart will help you build and

1161
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,599
framework for your weekly candle

1162
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,280
forecasting it and if you're trading in

1163
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
the right direction you only need really

1164
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,060
one good day of the week think about it

1165
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,060
if you get 30 to 50 Pips in one trading

1166
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,300
day that is all you need but I already

1167
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,440
know you're going to want to do more

1168
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,359
than that but use the rules that's been

1169
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,099
shown to you thus far this month in this

1170
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,660
first teaching and we're going to build

1171
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,400
on it and

1172
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,500
our understanding about how we can

1173
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,119
incorporate all these rules and more

1174
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,640
rules leading to your complete day

1175
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,900
trading system

1176
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,579
until next lesson wish you good luck and

1177
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,940
good Trading
