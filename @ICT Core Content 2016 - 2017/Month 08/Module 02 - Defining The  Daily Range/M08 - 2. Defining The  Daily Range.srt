1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,200
foreign

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,279
welcome back folks this is lesson two of

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,340
the April 2017 Itt mentorship

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,560
content dealing with ICT day trading

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,580
model

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,580
this lesson is defining the DailyRange

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,200
okay the retail 24-hour trading day

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,780
now I teach through the mt4 platform

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,719
and everyone is aware that if you hold

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
down control when you tap the y letter

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,820
it'll pull up the

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,039
period separators for the respective

13
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,140
time frame you have on your chart

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,399
and the

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
retail version of the 24 hour trading

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,320
day is not what we focus on but I want

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,760
to highlight the contrast between the

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
two because this is what you see

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,740
in a typical mt4 platform

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,320
the interbank 24-hour IPDA trading day

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,580
is very different

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,619
so if it's going to be a high

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,299
probability trade scenario that we're

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,280
going to be looking for it stands the

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,840
reason we have to start with the same

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,540
reference point that IPDA itself the

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,360
interbank price delivery algorithm uses

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,500
in referencing time

29
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,060
so we're going to have to use the same

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,220
thing that IPDA does

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,560
when we view price in the element of

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
time of day

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,860
so when we see these retail delineations

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,400
and folks have these on your charts 

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,140
that's pretty much a classic Telltale

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,280
sign they have no idea what they're

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,860
doing and they'll frame the day based on

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,540
these vertical lines

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,360
what we're going to show now is how a

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,780
interbank Trader views price in relative

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,500
terms to time

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,979
okay the first element we're going to

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,139
break down is the Asian range I get

44
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,700
questions a lot what is the kill zones

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,379
what is the Asian range when does it

46
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,900
begin when's it end all the things

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,360
dealing with time of day so this is the

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,760
definitive teaching so that way we can

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,800
go through the rest of the lessons for

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
April day trading this is the only one

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,900
you'll ever need to refer to so if

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,980
you've seen anything different in the

53
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,560
past this is the real one

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,099
foreign

55
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,660
PM Eastern Standard Time

56
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,220
in NewYork time

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,120
if this Begins the Asian range

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,920
every day at midnight Eastern Standard

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Time NewYork

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,099
ends the Asian range

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,080
we will learn specific things concerning

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,420
this range later in April for now I want

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,280
to give you the beginning endings of all

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,340
the specifics that deals with the IPDA

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,000
trading day

66
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,819
okay the ICT London killZone

67
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,040
every day at 1am Eastern Standard Time

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,680

70
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,659
Time NewYork ends the London Killzone

71
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,500
now we're going to learn specific things

72
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,180
concerning this Killzone later in April

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,340
but for now again

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,920
if you're ever questioning what I'm

75
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,180
referring to in terms of the beginning

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
and endings you have to have a NewYork

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,819
time clock so either on your smartphone

78
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,159
they give you an opportunity to do World

79
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,500
clocks whatever the time is in NewYork

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,200
use the times I'm giving you in this

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,659
specific teaching and set that as your

82
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,940
beginning and ending points for all the

83
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,319
references in time

84
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,400

the skill Zone later in April but again

92
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,740
for now this is the actual times I use

93
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,120
to hunt the setup

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,860

this killZone later in April

102
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,580
but for now

103
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,740
whenever refer to London clothes this is

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,800
the time window again always in whatever

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,419
NewYork time is whether it's daylight

106
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,720
savings time or regular time this is the

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
times I'm using

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,180
foreign

109
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,100
true day definition

110
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,919
every day at 12 AM midnight NewYork

111
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,220
time Begins the IPDA true day this is

112
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,199
the beginning of the 24-hour interbank

113
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,139
trading day

114
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,400
every day at 3 PM NewYork time ends

115
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,340
the IPDA true day 24-hour interbank

116
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,919
trading day

117
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,840
we will learn specific things concerning

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,759
this time range in April

119
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,800
but for now know that this is the

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
beginning and the ending of an interbank

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,860
24-hour cycle

122
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,660
okay so let's take a closer look at what

123
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,180
we've outlined here

124
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,860
what we have is a true day

125
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,660
for a Monday

126
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,060
April 3rd 2017.

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
we classify this as a IPDA true day open

128
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,340
at midnight

129
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,080
and Monday true day close at 3 PM

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,060
NewYork time

131
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,240
you can see that there are very very

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,180
specific time elements being shown here

133
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,720
not only are we blending elements of if

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,600
the data ranges and PD array Matrix

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
we're looking at institutional order

136
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,759
flow but now we have an element of time

137
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,240
that it gets so precise it's hard to

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,720
deny how anyone looking at this chart

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
can see there's an algorithmic pattern

140
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,860
and it's related to time

141
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,800
now we're not going to PDA arrays and

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,960
and all the institutional reference

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,240
points but I want you to focus at the

144
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,620
time Windows here

145
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,840
look at the turning points that we see

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,539
here look at the daily High

147
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,660
and look at the daily low

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,300
look at the swing points throughout the

149
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,740
rest of the day

150
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,800
there's logical reasons for why price

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,259
goes to these levels and why they go

152
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,979
specifically and precisely to a one

153
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,940
particular level or another

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,740
I want to add

155
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,560
the 8 20 AM NewYork time

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,020
this is the CME open

157
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,060
look at this line draw straight up with

158
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,800
your imagination and goes right to that

159
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,860
little short term low and price rallies

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,460
away from that that is not randomness

161
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,319
okay I'm going to teach you a lot about

162
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,620
8 20 AM CME open that I did not give you

163
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,940
and other teachings

164
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,460
this area here between the London and

165
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
NewYork kill zones this is London lunch

166
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,440
this is generally when we're not looking

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
for any major significant price moves

168
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,419
usually the market goes quiet or it

169
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,400
continues in the path it's set for

170
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,180
London open

171
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,039
framing the day like this

172
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,220
you can clearly see using Power3

173
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,500
the open at midnight

174
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,539
small little down move in the Asian

175
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,039
range we would not be concerned with

176
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,280
that the up move on the Asian range

177
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,860
resistance being broken out the high the

178
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,139
day forms right at the beginning of the

179
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,979
ICT London killZone that begins at 1am

180
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,660
NewYork time

181
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,539
folks that are using my free tutorials

182
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,919
they're waiting for two o'clock three

183
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,360
o'clock at four o'clock

184
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,899
this is the actual Killzone I use so the

185
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,679
time window begins at 1am it ends at 5am

186
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,160
look at the high that forms at 5 AM at

187
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,920
the very end of London Killzone

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,800
exactly right there

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,380
now look at the NewYork session

190
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,459
Killzone

191
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,740
we have a short-term High that's framed

192
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,019
inside of that NewYork killZone but

193
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,839
look at the low that forms in the actual

194
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,899
NewYork Hill Zone it forms at 8 20 AM

195
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,760
CME open

196
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,920
I'll tell you what the CME open is later

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
on but for now just keep that as a

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,459
reference point on your own

199
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,800
charts

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,540
the high that forms in the NewYork

201
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,500
session

202
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,480
okay there's a swing High forums and it

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,600
trades down into the London close

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
London close makes the LOD it

205
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,100
goes in consolidation And Trades off the

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,820
low for a close or what I refer to as

207
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,220
the NewYork close when I say NewYork

208
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,120
close

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm referring to epta True day close it

210
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
just saves me the time of saying so true

211
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
day begins at midnight NewYork time and

212
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,440
ends at 3 PM

213
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,560
NewYork time now 3 PM is because bonds

214
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,779
close and the influence that interest

215
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,120
rates have on the currency markets will

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
have ended by then the last hour two

217
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,700
o'clock to 3 PM NewYork time will

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,339
always encapsulate any movement that's

219
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,800
related to FOMC so interest rate

220
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,100
announcements FOMC minutes all those

221
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,420
events that take place around the two

222
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,040
o'clock hour in NewYork time

223
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
that's what encapsulates that last

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,140
portion no matter what happens in FOMC

225
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,560
generally the move has ended or the bulk

226
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,140
of the move has ended by 3 PM NewYork

227
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,980
time

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,080
and that's how you frame the entire

229
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,940
DailyRange

230
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,000
open high low and close and that's the

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,040
delineations of each

232
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,440
so going forward in this month we'll

233
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,300
know exactly what we're referring to in

234
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,080
time

235
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,000
and how to use these elements for

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
precision

237
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
and until next lesson I wish you good

238
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,019
luck and good Trading
