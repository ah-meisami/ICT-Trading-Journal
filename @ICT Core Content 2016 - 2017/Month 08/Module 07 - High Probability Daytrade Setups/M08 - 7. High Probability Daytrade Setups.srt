1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,560
welcome back folks this is lesson seven

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,960
of the ICT day trading model

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,480
high probability day trade setups

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,399
okay what makes day trades high

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
probability

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,840
the highest importance is placed on the

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,520
HTF daily and or four hour

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,739
Direction

9
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,840
when daily and or four hour direction is

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
bullish

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,040
use previous days low to high for

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,960
retracement entries

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,680
use previous days NewYork session low

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,760
to high

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
retracement entries

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,559
use previous days low

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,520
for Sell stop raid to accumulate lungs

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,500
focusing on the anticipated move from

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
HTF discount to premium PD

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,320
arrays

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,740
when daily and or four hour direction is

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,700
bearish

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,340
use previous days high to low for

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,920
retracement entries use previous day's

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,259
NewYork session high to low for

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,240
retracement entries

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
use previous days high for buy stop rate

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,259
accumulate shorts

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,400
focusing on the anticipated move from

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,500
the HTF premium to

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,640
Discount PD arrays

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,820
when we're looking for a high

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,460
probability day trades what we're really

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,820
focusing on is where's the next most

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,340
likely Direction higher or lower

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,740
and off of what level and trading up to

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,619
what level for a profit

38
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,200
there's several swings that you need to

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,780
be aware of obviously the previous day

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,000
is high and low

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,420
the previous days NewYork session

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,640
range from high to low that means the

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,799
sessions highest high and the lowest low

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,660
during the NewYork trading hours

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,360
there's also one that's not listed here

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,879
but I want you to think about

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,739
what's the highest high and the lowest

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,459
low

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,780
during the London session

50
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,040
that means the London

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,980
high in the London low

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
for the Elena Killzone

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,760
then also looking at the London high or

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,020
low

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,080
to the low or high contrary to it in

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,340
other words the total range from the

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,620
London session extreme whether it be

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,120
high or low

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,640
to the lower high prior to the NewYork

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,620
session beginning

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,480
so between

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
NewYork opening

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,680
what's the extreme on the range for that

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,860
day in London is it high or low relative

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,239
to the beginning of NewYork session

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,580
that range also is important

67
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,260
when we look through price and we find

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,360
the opportunities to be a day trader

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,860
you're looking for the similar things

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,420
we've went over on a HTF

71
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,360
charts just on a lower time frame

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,519
nothing that you see in the lower time

73
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,140
frame is going to be any different from

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,239
what we've outlined from what we've seen

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,980
in the daily or weekly or monthly

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
every example

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,159
that's being outlined here for framing a

78
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,840
high probability setup

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,799
this is not the Panacea list okay this

80
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,599
is this is not going to be every

81
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,040
possible scenario

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,400
these are the criterias that I look for

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,379
each trading day when the conditions are

84
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,980
ripe so in other words I've done my

85
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,080
due diligence if you will from the

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,299
HTF and I've arrived at

87
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,980
what I believe is the most probable

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,000
Direction

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
on a HTF chart

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,620
and then what I'll look for is if I'm

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,659
bullish I want to look for the range

92
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,599
from London's extreme high or low to

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,980
that which

94
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,200
the opposite extreme higher low would be

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
prior to NewYork so whatever the range

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
is from London

97
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,220
to right before NewYork opening

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,320
that's important I want to measure that

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,900
range if I'm bearish

100
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,880
that range is going to help me find the

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
next trading day

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,840
retracement up

103
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,300
during that protractionary state that

104
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,979
move up is going to be a retracement

105
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,979
into that London session range from

106
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,660
London going into the beginning of New

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,780
York

108
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll also measure the NewYork session

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
range high and low

110
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,500
that also many times will give me the

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,259
setup that's framed for the next day's

112
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,720
higher low it'll be retracement inside

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,259
that range

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,060
I'll look for the previous days high and

115
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,919
low

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,160
to look for stop rates

117
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,479
generally you're going to see those

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,180
scenarios occur when there is

119
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,900
an end to a most recent move in other

120
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,340
words if we've seen several days go up

121
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,639
it's going to go up into a premium array

122
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,080
and it's probably going to trade above

123
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,759
an old High

124
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll look for a buy stock run there and

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,360
then go short the next day

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,900
vice versa

127
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,880
if the Market's been trading lower and

128
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,860
it trades down to a discount PD array

129
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,600
I'll look for the market to trade down

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
below a previous day's low

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,060
I'll buy the sell stops

132
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,500
and I'll use that as a day trade

133
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,900
daily and four hour when we use those

134
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,419
independently or in concert with one

135
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,460
another to build our bearish or bullish

136
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,600
ideas

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
what we're looking for is the price

138
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,600
analysis of seeing is price supporting

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,580
bullishness are the is it bouncing off

140
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,680
of bull shoulder blocks is it rejecting

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,180
old lows and and showing them

142
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,100
willingness to go higher is it filling

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,620
in gaps below us and then rallying

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,320
those ideas are the first things that we

145
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,259
look for and then are we seeing

146
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,199
short-term premium arrays violating

147
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,560
if that's occurring then it's bullish

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,360
institutional workflows is bullish and

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
the opposite is said in Reverse when

150
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,580
you're bearish

151
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,979
when do I look to buy for day trades

152
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,780
ideally in seasonal periods of the year

153
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,539
but it's not required but ideally it has

154
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,800
to make the list in here because this is

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,759
the high probability series

156
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,660
when the current quarter or new quarter

157
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,800
is expected to be bullish

158
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,639
after the daily chart has reacted

159
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,880
positively on a discount PD array it

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
could be a bull shorter block any of the

161
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,500
discount arrays that's known to You by

162
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
The pdra Matrix

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,919
when price has a clear

164
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,840
unobscured path to an opposing premium

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
array in other words it's very easily

166
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,340
seen what it would reach for above you

167
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,840
presently

168
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,419
if you can't see it very easily

169
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,740
it's probably not going to be a high

170
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,520
probability setup

171
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,639
the ideal days of the week buying are

172
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,900
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday

173
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,680
you will refer to the central bank

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
dealers range and determine if it's less

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,039
than 40 Pips ideally

176
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,940
and we're going to demand that the Asian

177
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,940
range is in a 20 pip range or less ahead

178
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,840
of Frankfurt opening

179
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,900
buying between 2 AM and 4 AM NewYork

180
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,060
time we're going to be seeking the low

181
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,539
of the day

182
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,620
we're going to be buying it one to two

183
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
StandardDeviation of the Central Bank

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,639
dealers range and or Asian range coupled

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,080
with a discount PD array

186
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,639
time frame we're going to execute on is

187
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,220
a 15 and or a five minute chart

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
now where do I look to buy for day

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,740
trades

190
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,380
I like buying Under the Asian range plus

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,319
five Pips for the spread

192
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,240
I like looking for fair value gaps below

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,259
a short-term low from the previous days

194
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,060
NewYork session in other words after

195
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,860
NewYork opens up

196
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm looking for short-term lows that

197
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,699
form going into the close at the start

198
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,860
of a new day Zero GMT I look back in the

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,099
previous day's range in the NewYork

200
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,120
session generally you're going to find a

201
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,260
low

202
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,599
and if we can drop down into that in

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,919
London

204
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,659
I'll look for those Sell stops to be

205
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,580
triggered and then I'll go along from

206
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,100
that but it has to overlap with other

207
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,200
things CentralBankDealersRange Asian

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
range there's ideas

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,399
also has to be in time of day

210
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,519
London open Killzone

211
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,100
little shorter block that resides below

212
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,600
a short term low

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,660
either in the previous day or intraday

214
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,860
today

215
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,360
in other words it could be a short-term

216
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,640
little intraday load it formed and then

217
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,680
it trades lower than that into a bullish

218
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,959
or a block that's a very very strong

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
condition when the overall picture is

220
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,160
bullish

221
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,660
I would be buying in that scenario

222
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,180
during London

223
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,720
if I'm very bullish I'll trade long at

224
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
one StandardDeviation

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,899
below

226
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,600
the CentralBankDealersRange or Asian

227
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
range

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,380
and any discount PD array overlap while

229
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,519
in the London killZone

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,940
inside the protraction lower

231
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,860
post 12 AM to 2 AM with IPDA

232
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,080
in other words it's trading down I'm

233
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,360
going to be looking to go long during

234
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,640
that Judah swing and again it has to be

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,180
an overlap with a discount PD array

236
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
feeling a liquidity void that completes

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
under a short-term low

238
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,700
all right so we saw on the second setup

239
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,220
fair value Gap it could be a larger gap

240
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,080
which would be basically a liquidity

241
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,360
void that would be completed or filled

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
in

243
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,899
below a short-term loan so what we're

244
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:19,920
doing so we're really trying to buy

245
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,959
below lows

246
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,940
looking to accumulate sell stop

247
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,339
liquidity that we can buy from

248
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,720
if after Rally post 12 AM NewYork time

249
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,360
buy the first retracement into a 15 and

250
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
or

251
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,080
five minute bullish order block similar

252
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,180
to what I'm saying here is if we have

253
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,640
rallied right after midnight

254
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
we didn't see any drop down or

255
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,300
protraction a state that would put us

256
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
into a discount

257
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,720
if it's been riding straight up

258
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,060
if you get into the two o'clock to four

259
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,220
o'clock time period today well then kill

260
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,380
zone sweet spot if you will

261
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
I'll buy the first rejection down until

262
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,459
a bullish order block on a 5 or 15

263
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,240
minute basis

264
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,459
one or two StandardDeviation in the

265
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,019
Asian range

266
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,720
coupled with discount PD array in other

267
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
words I'm looking for two for one

268
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,100
StandardDeviation drops of the Asian

269
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,260
range total range damn

270
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
and it's going to be overlapping with a

271
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,260
discount PD array so I'm blending those

272
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,500
two

273
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,440
if a short term low is taken out twice

274
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,740
but there has been no upside

275
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,880
protractionary state in other words we

276
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,740
haven't seen the market go up first and

277
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,019
then go down twice the second time in

278
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,040
that condition it's probably going to

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,019
keep on going lower but if it has not

280
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,640
seen any protractionary move on the

281
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,740
upside or due to swing up

282
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,140
we go down for a low and then one more

283
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,779
time blow out that low I'll buy that as

284
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,339
a turtle suit

285
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,740
now what I've outlined here

286
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,680
are my favorite setups these are the

287
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,800
conditions and you have to find them in

288
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,180
examples

289
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,339
I could show you examples but

290
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,019
nonetheless

291
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,940
that's not going to help you

292
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,700
these are the Frameworks I look for in

293
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,079
other words if I see these types of

294
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,660
scenarios unfold generally these are the

295
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,899
ones that typically get into my thought

296
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,519
process I'm looking for certain things

297
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,760
to line up certain some type of play or

298
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,279
for instance if we were a sports team

299
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,940
okay and the coach has a Playbook and he

300
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,980
likes certain  plays that he makes his

301
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,320
players go through well these are the

302
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
scenarios I love when it comes to

303
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,180
trading the London open

304
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,560
these are my like toolbox or consistency

305
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,279
these types of Trades form several times

306
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,600
a week

307
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,240
if you look for a few of them and

308
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,980
understand what they what they are when

309
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,480
the Market's bullish

310
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
we've shown willingness of respect to

311
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,680
daily discount PD array

312
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,100
one of these criteria are going to meet

313
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,940
every London session out there will have

314
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,100
something in this list that forms now I

315
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,139
already know what you're going to think

316
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,839
wow Michael this is a lot which one do I

317
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,060
pick well if you study them they all

318
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,160
don't have the same characteristics

319
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,540
it depends on what the Market's

320
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,800
providing you

321
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,500
so when you're watching 12 AM NewYork

322
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,959
time we're watching to see which

323
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,720
scenario unfolds

324
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,760
remember we're looking for that initial

325
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,620
drop down ideally

326
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,139
but if it doesn't happen we have one

327
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,639
condition here where it says if it

328
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,980
rallies straight from 12 AM

329
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,440
when we get to 2 AM we're going to buy

330
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
the first retracement into a 15 or five

331
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,639
minute order block boom it's over

332
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,260
so you got every scenario that I would

333
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,779
be looking for for a living open loan

334
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,420
placing stop losses in a buy for day

335
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,839
trades

336
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
whatever you do

337
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,200
and whatever you use for your initial

338
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,220
stop loss do not rush moving it I

339
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,360
already know what you're trying to do

340
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,100
you want to get to break even plus five

341
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,500
plus twenty forget that in day trading

342
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
in London because you can get a double

343
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
pass they can come back and knock you

344
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,820
out and you'll miss the entire move

345
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,639
leave your stop at initial until you get

346
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,459
to at least

347
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,800
40 to 50 of the DailyRange if you can

348
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
get that in London then bring it to

349
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,399
break even but anything prior to that

350
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,399
don't do it

351
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,540
if you're trading in Central Bank

352
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,940
dealers range overlap with a PD array

353
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,120
the stop has to be 30 Pips under your

354
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,420
entry

355
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,699
if you're trading a run under the Asian

356
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,320
range in other words what we're doing is

357
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,420
we're watching price trade down below

358
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,860
the Asian range it might be one Standard

359
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,260
Deviation might go a half a state  one

360
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,060
full StandardDeviation anything below

361
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,800
an H in range low

362
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,740
your stop needs to be 40 Pips below your

363
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,040
entry

364
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,579
if you're trading any sell stop raid

365
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,459
30 Pips under the low

366
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,980
of the entry you're using

367
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,079
all right you're going to use the low

368
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,320
as your primary entry point that low

369
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,880
you're going to try to enter below that

370
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,639
your stop has to be 30 Pips below that

371
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,820
low

372
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,880
if you're trading the first retracement

373
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
into a bull shoulder block

374
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,440
you have to be 10 Pips under the lowest

375
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,040
LOD

376
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,500
if you're trading the second return for

377
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,540
sell stops in other words we've had 

378
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,300
move lower and then it moves lower one

379
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,279
more time takes out the Sell stops your

380
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,120
stuff has to be below that 30 Pips

381
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
again that one is if you don't see any

382
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,560
move right away after midnight if it's

383
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,540
only been a straight down move then it

384
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,860
goes down one more time blows at the

385
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,620
load that's formed initially

386
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,839
your stop has to be 30 Pips below that

387
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
if you're buying that as a turtle suit

388
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,079
if you're trading any other setup not

389
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
described above what you're gonna be

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
using is 50 of the average DailyRange

391
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,440
of the last five days subtracted from

392
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,600
the Asian range low

393
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,820
assume you have a 100 pip average daily

394
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,800
range for the last five days what you're

395
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,459
going to do is take 50 Pips minus

396
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,320
the Asian range low whatever that price

397
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,060
is that's what your stop loss has to be

398
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,500
taking profits in buy day trades

399
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,579
foreign

400
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,019
you're always going to try to take

401
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,779
something off and gain at 20 to 30 Pips

402
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,820
always do this in London

403
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,540
you're gonna look to scale something off

404
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,880
every two StandardDeviation of the

405
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,620
Asian range or Central Bank dealers

406
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,500
range yes I said it requires you to see

407
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,420
two StandardDeviation before you take

408
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,339
the next level profit that means after

409
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,380
your first 20 to 30 Pips

410
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,759
you're going to wait for two Standard

411
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,160
Deviation of the Asian range or Central

412
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,600
Bank dealers range then you take

413
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,399
something off again

414
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,959
foreign

415
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,880
take something off at the previous day's

416
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,000
High plus 5 to 15 Pips

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,260
because you could end up in a turtle

418
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
soup scenario and it could retrace on

419
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,919
you

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,140
take something off at 50 of the price

421
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,020
range you're trading in on a 60 Minute

422
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,699
basis in other words inside the range

423
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,240
where are we at if we rally up

424
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,579
inside that range remember equilibrium

425
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,220
could be an impactful level so you want

426
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,260
to take something off there as well

427
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,700
because it could reverse on you

428
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,380
take or have had taken 60 to 80 percent

429
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,460
off

430
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,260
at five day average DailyRange

431
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,720
projections always do this so in other

432
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,880
words basically if you've not taken off

433
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,799
anything except for the first 20 30 Pips

434
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,539
you didn't do anything for two Standard

435
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,799
Deviation of the Asian range or Central

436
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,179
Bank dealerships because maybe it didn't

437
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,919
do that maybe it hasn't fulfilled that

438
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,500
maybe you haven't done anything with a

439
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,299
previous day's High hasn't traded there

440
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,200
yet

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,400
and maybe you haven't  seen a 50 range

442
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,020
in the last 60 Minutes  price action

443
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,120
then you have to consider average daily

444
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,039
range the last five days you need to be

445
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,980
taking at least 60 to 80 off at that

446
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,940
point

447
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,220
always do this and then you can leave a

448
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,480
little portion on to see if you're going

449
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,700
to get more juice out of that lemon and

450
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,120
hold for a later portion of the day

451
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,679
if trading higher than the previous

452
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,840
trading week take something off there

453
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,340
because you can get a turtle soups in

454
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,919
there in that environment

455
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,840
if trading higher than a previous month

456
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,820
is high take something off there

457
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,980
in time of day scale out

458
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,780
something

459
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,660
at or just above the five o'clock hour

460
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,320
NewYork time

461
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,700
in time of day you want to scale out a

462
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,179
short-term High prior to the 7 AM New

463
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,160
York open knowing let me outline this

464
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,940
again these are time date specific you

465
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,100
want to take some profit

466
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,720
when it's bullish and you've been

467
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,919
rallying

468
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,780
whatever that short-term High that's

469
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,900
forming prior to 7 AM that means

470
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
there's going to be a short-term little

471
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,720
rally going into seven o'clock

472
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,120
whatever that high is as it's rallying

473
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,980
you want to take something off there

474
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,419
because NewYork could be a reversal

475
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,080
in time of day

476
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,179
look to scale out between 10 AM and 11

477
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,720
AM NewYork time during the rally so in

478
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,700
other words whenever price is moving up

479
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,059
at 10 AM that leg in price higher you

480
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,559
want to be exiting and taking something

481
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,600
out as it's rallying up

482
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,679
ideally any of the above scenarios

483
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,559
coupled with a PD array in a premium

484
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
basis

485
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,299
now obviously you're probably saying

486
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,460
well Michael I only did too many so I

487
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,780
can only afford to do that how can I

488
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,919
take this many

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
 portions off you can't

490
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,380
but if you look at it again study it not

491
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,600
all these conditions can be present

492
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
but you want to look for the ones that

493
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,100
may potentially be there for you

494
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,140
you can go through this list

495
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,000
and look at your trade as you get ready

496
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,700
to take it and see right away if any of

497
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,720
these are going to be potential

498
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,980
candidates

499
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,500
but you have to take profits on these

500
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,380
rules that's how I do it this is the

501
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,179
reason why I do it and when you see me

502
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,220
taking positions and scaling them off

503
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,440
these this is the criteria I'm using

504
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,000
When I Look to short day trades

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,280
ideally in seasonal bearish periods of

506
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,020
the year but it's not required

507
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,160
when the current quarter or new quarter

508
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,360
is expected bearish

509
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,980
after the daily chart has reacted

510
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,140
positively on a premium PD array

511
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,780
when price has a clear unobstructed path

512
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,520
to an opposing discount array

513
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,860
the ideal days of the week shorting are

514
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,580
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday

515
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,380
refer to the CentralBankDealersRange

516
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,299
and determine if it's less than 40 Pips

517
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,780
ideally

518
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,220
demand the Asian range to be in a 20-fit

519
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,900
range or less ahead of the Frankfurt

520
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,919
opening

521
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,720
that's basically one o'clock in the

522
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,280
morning NewYork Times

523
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,620
early morning

524
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,440
shorting between 2 AM and 4 AM New

525
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,940
York Times seeking the HOD

526
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,340
generally I'm looking to sell one to two

527
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,600
StandardDeviation of the Central Bank

528
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,120
dealers range and or Asian range coupled

529
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,500
with a premium PD array

530
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,260
time frame to execute on is either 5 or

531
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,340
15 minute time frame

532
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,620
where do I look to short day trades

533
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,340
I like to run above the Asian range at

534
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,159
least five Pips above it I want to be

535
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,880
selling short there

536
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,480
a fair value Gap above a short-term high

537
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,480
from the previous day's NewYork session

538
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,039
there's going to be buy stops above that

539
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,020
I'll look to sell that as it rallies

540
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,159
above that in NewYork session

541
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,820
bearish order block above a short-term

542
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,000
High either previous day or today in

543
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
other words if there's a bullish order

544
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,080
block that resides in price action and

545
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,480
there's a short-term High just below

546
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,940
that we haven't rated yet as soon as we

547
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,440
trade above that short-term high and

548
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,059
into that very shorter block

549
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,340
if it does that during London session

550
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,659
I'll go short there

551
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,860
if I'm very bearish one Standard

552
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,740
Deviation with any premium PD array in

553
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,960
the open killZone I can trade on that

554
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,860
inside the protraction higher post 12 AM

555
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,440
midnight NewYork time to 2 AM NewYork

556
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,159
time

557
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,419
with a PD array or a premium PDA rate

558
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,880
specifically that's enough for me so

559
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,980
basically I'm looking at a Judah swing

560
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,840
that occurs right from Midnight going up

561
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,900
into 2 AM it can happen prior

562
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,120
to 2 AM but generally you want to see

563
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,400
that move right after 12 AM up it

564
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,620
trades into a premium PD array that's

565
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,340
enough to get short

566
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,600
filling a liquidity void that completes

567
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,220
above a short-term High

568
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,380
if after

569
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,039
the drop post 12 AM

570
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,840
going to sell the first retracement into

571
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,419
a 15 or 5 minute bearish order block

572
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,640
one to two StandardDeviation in the

573
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,559
Asian range coupled with a premium PD

574
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,799
array I can sell that

575
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,440
and if short-term high is taken out

576
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,860
twice with no initial downside

577
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,360
I'll sell that as a turtle soup

578
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,280
placing stop losses in short day trades

579
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
whenever you use the initial stop loss

580
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,179
obviously don't be in a rush to move

581
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,580
that we've said that in the buy sides

582
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,100
the same thing here for shorting

583
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,539
if you're trading the Central Bank

584
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,880
dealers range overlap with a PDA

585
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,520
stop must be 30 Pips above

586
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,299
your entry

587
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,260
if you're trading a run above the Asian

588
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,740
Range High the stop has to be 40 Pips if

589
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,260
you're trading any buy stock rate

590
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,840
your stop has to be 30 Pips above the

591
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,100
high or your entry

592
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,640
if you're trading the first retracement

593
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,919
into a bearish order block your stop has

594
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,539
to be 10 Pips above the highest high of

595
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,780
the day

596
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,480
if you're trading the second return for

597
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
buy stops or basically a turtle suit and

598
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,419
we have not seen an immediate rally

599
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,960
lower in price after midnight

600
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,820
your stuff has to be 30 Pips above the

601
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,600
highest HOD

602
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,000
if you're trading any other setup not

603
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,520
described above use 50 of the average

604
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,860
DailyRange of the last five days added

605
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,000
to the Asian Range High

606
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,539
taking profits in short day trades

607
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,460
always try to take something off and

608
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,320
gain at 20 to 30 Pips always

609
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,820
look to scale something off every two

610
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,039
StandardDeviation in the Asian range

611
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,480
or CentralBankDealersRange

612
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,559
take something off at the previous day's

613
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,659
low minus 5 to 15 Pips

614
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,000
take something off at the 50 range or

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
equilibrium of the price range you are

616
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,820
trading inside of on a 60 Minute chart

617
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,220
take or have taken sixty to eighty

618
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,900
percent off at the average DailyRange

619
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,179
of the last five days do this always

620
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,440
if trading lower than the previous

621
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,600
trading week's low take something off

622
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
there you could have a reversal or

623
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,260
rejection

624
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,880
if trading lower than the previous

625
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,400
month's low again this could be a

626
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,840
potential reversal so you want to take

627
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,059
something off there

628
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,799
in time of day

629
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,100
scale out something at or prior to 5 AM

630
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,740
NewYork time

631
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,380
in time of day scale out a short-term

632
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,840
low prior to 7 AM NewYork open in

633
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,220
other words NewYork open could be

634
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,260
reversal or generally a retracement into

635
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,520
the 820 CME opening so you want to be

636
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,380
seeing profit taking some measure

637
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,900
portion come off as profit as it's

638
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,419
accelerating lower ahead of 7 AM

639
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,480
in time of day scale out at 10 AM to 11

640
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,520
AM NewYork time while price is still

641
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,059
declining

642
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,620
ideally any of the above scenarios

643
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,440
coupled with a premium PD array now

644
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,419
obviously I've given you

645
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,720
several instances and circumstances and

646
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,179
and outlines for

647
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,059
the probable

648
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,740
plan of action

649
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,600
whether you're entering whether you're

650
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,460
taking profit where you're using your

651
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,419
stop at these are my general rules of

652
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,400
operation this is what I generally look

653
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,860
for these are the things I do how I

654
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,779
manage position what I'm doing initially

655
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,059
with the with the stops where I'm

656
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,520
looking to take profits at the ones that

657
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,140
I did not incorporate here were

658
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,720
obviously  been taught in other places

659
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,580
so I didn't have to rehash or put in

660
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,840
filler

661
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,580
any projection on the FIB 127 168 and

662
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,900
the

663
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,520
100 percent

664
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,980
symmetrical price swing or 100 move

665
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,679
measured move those ideas couple with

666
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,539
any of these as well really amplifies

667
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,980
for profit taking

668
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,380
this lesson obviously

669
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,900
I don't want to see it on YouTube and if

670
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,100
it ends up on YouTube I'll have it

671
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,539
pulled down but

672
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,039
the

673
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,559
the lesson itself I could pretty much

674
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,840
show this on

675
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,360
baby Pips and nobody would understand

676
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,299
what it's talking about so  that's the

677
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,679
reason why I went through a great deal

678
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,320
of information in January and all the

679
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,539
way up to now because you know all the

680
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,400
elements that's being described here or

681
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,659
you should know them because you've

682
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,760
studied all the previous months

683
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,520
the criteria and the Rules of Engagement

684
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,100
that's being explained and outlined for

685
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,200
both sides of buying and selling

686
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,480
not every single one of these are going

687
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,940
to be

688
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,500
usable you can't use every single one of

689
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,000
them they're not going to be applicable

690
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,580
to every trade that you're in so don't

691
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,260
think because there's a laundry list of

692
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,720
things and scenarios here not all of

693
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,400
them are going to be able to be applied

694
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,039
to your trade but knowing what they are

695
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,740
in advance and outline form here you can

696
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,960
already see how you can look to see if

697
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,480
it's going to be a probable scenario for

698
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,059
your particular trade idea

699
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,159
you may not be trading anywhere near a

700
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,720
weekly low

701
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,460
you may not be trading anywhere near a

702
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,679
monthly low so they may not even be any

703
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,740
consideration at all

704
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,480
you probably already took something off

705
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,880
at 20 to 30 Pips and it hasn't much

706
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
moved beyond that going into 5 AM your

707
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,080
time so you wouldn't consider that

708
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,159
either

709
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,820
the scaling out ahead of 7 AM

710
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,299
maybe you have taken 20 or 30 Pips

711
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,940
already in London and then it went

712
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,140
you know

713
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,820
the whole full average DailyRange all

714
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,080
during London

715
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,580
you you're not going to take something

716
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,100
ahead of 7am on that because you've

717
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,320
already taken something based on average

718
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,380
daily ratings being fulfilled

719
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,000
looking at

720
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,580
the scenarios that would potentially

721
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,240
paint out here and also for the entries

722
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,159
again not all of them will be applicable

723
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,559
so don't freak out because it seems like

724
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,360
a whole lot and yes you're being

725
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,460
challenged I promised you in the latter

726
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,600
lessons you're going to have to think

727
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,880
you have to think for yourself you have

728
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,380
to have rules you have to look for these

729
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,539
types of things yourself in the charts

730
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,120
they all won't be there

731
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,159
so you're not having to look through all

732
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,679
these things to to whittle down to what

733
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,179
you should be doing for your trade

734
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,460
all of the criteria that's been listed

735
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,720
here for the setups the buys the sells

736
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,700
where your stop loss is there are

737
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,399
specific rules for all of that I have

738
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,399
specific outlined scenarios in this

739
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,440
teaching that if you stick to them

740
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,440
you'll do everything that I do on a week

741
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,419
by week basis when I'm Trading

742
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,860
