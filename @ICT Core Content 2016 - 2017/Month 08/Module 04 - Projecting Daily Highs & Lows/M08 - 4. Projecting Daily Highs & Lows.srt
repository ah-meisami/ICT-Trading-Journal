00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,700
welcome back folks to the April 2017 ICT

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,699
mentorship content

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,400
for teaching ICT day trading model this

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
is Lesson Four

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,180
specifically teaching projecting daily

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,960
highs and lows

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,660
okay as we just mentioned in the

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,440
previous teaching lesson number three

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,780
potential Bank dealers range

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,840
when we talk about the most likely Sell

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,800
days

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,320
moving up as high as three Standard

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,579
Deviation

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,579
and most buy days moving down making the

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,039
LOD as low as three Standard

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,600
Deviation from the CentralBankDealersRange

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,980
we can take this one step further

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,120
the range at which price Works Within

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,060
the protractionary state away from the

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,200
CentralBankDealersRange in other

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,140
words are we moving higher away from the

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,760
CentralBankDealersRange for a sell-off

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
or a Sell day

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,680
how much of that range are we moving

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,020
now this is not Fibonacci extensions or

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,340
projections or anything like that we're

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,040
looking specifically at the range that

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,860
IPDA will go into protractionary State

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,420
and move

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,880
counter the direction of the intended

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,619
direction of the day

33
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,479
in other words it's the Judas swing

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,240
we don't necessarily have to know

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,900
beforehand to the PIP what the extension

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,759
is going to be away from

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,460
the CentralBankDealersRange we just

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,780
need to know

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,299
what it is after the move has already

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,159
ensued so even if we get it wrong okay

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm gonna play double tap against for a

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,700
moment say you don't get it right in

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,920
London but you're able to capitalize on

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,860
a continuation in NewYork

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,899
how far in

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,540
the future will price reach based on

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,520
IPDA and using the CentralBankDealersRange that's what this teaching will

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,860
give us

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,599
and just like we showed with the

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
previous slide

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
ideal scenarios are going to be seen

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,720
with no more than two Standard

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,000
Deviation usually that's about the the

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
bulk of buy and sell days you'll see

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
price go down many times just one

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,500
StandardDeviation but two is generally

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,900
the general rule of thumb but across the

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,879
board as a general thumb they generally

60
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,099
don't like to go beyond three Standard

61
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,239
Deviation

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,840
and we already assumed

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,720
the role for the use of four Standard

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,340
Deviation in the previous teaching

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,400
okay just a quick Brief Review because I

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,019
don't know when you're gonna watch

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,720
the lesson three in review so I'm going

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,580
to use these slides again because it's

69
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,680
Salient for this topic

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,180
when we look at the CentralBankDealersRange again

72
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
the range between two o'clock and eight

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,500
PM

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,900
that range is ideally best suited for

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,780
our use less than 40 Pips and again

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,239
preferably 20 to 30 Pips

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,220
we move to the sidelines and we do not

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,620
look to trade with the CentralBankDealersRange in our repertoire

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,440
when the range is greater than 40 Pips

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,540
and again we're focusing on

82
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,640
nailing down where the high or the day

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
on the low of the date may be formed

84
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,879
okay and we always look at the CentralBankDealersRange in terms of using

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
the spread of the wick to Wick high to

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,040
low range between 2 PM and 8 PM New

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,200
York time

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,680
and I like to look at the bodies

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,099
highest high in the form of open or

91
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,319
close and the lowest low in the form of

92
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,080
an open or close not the Wicks so I get

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
the range in the bodies but then I also

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,080
do it on the Wicks as well because you

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,299
want to do everything you see in this

96
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,500
teaching here you're going to do the

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,720
same thing using the Wicks but I'm

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
teaching it through the use of the

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
bodies because that's predominantly what

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,880
I go to first I get the ranges and

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
projections and measurements based on

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,519
the bodies of the candles

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,180
okay so now

104
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,940
now we get to the part where most of you

105
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,280
have been waiting for a long time to

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,360
learn this

107
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
and to be quite honest with you I'm not

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,620
sure why I'm doing it

109
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,419
it's one of those things that I've kept

110
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,300
for a long long time and I promised that

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,479
you would learn it in this mentorship so

112
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,400
if you are ever

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
in the sharing Spirit if you're ever in

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
the Robin Hood Mentality you know you

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
want to give to everyone else that

116
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,080
aren't a part of this mentorship

117
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
um this is one of those things you just

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,620
really really really want to keep to

119
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,380
yourself it's not common knowledge it's

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,540
not out there anywhere else believe me

121
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,699
when you start looking at it and seeing

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,340
it you'll it's

123
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,600
mind-boggling it really is mind-boggling

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
how precise you can get

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,380
but

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,139
we we showed the StandardDeviation and

127
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,660
the application of thereof okay and

128
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,520
obviously it looks like just grabbing

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,400
the best ones and doing that and there

130
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,320
it is it's as simple as that and it's

131
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,539
all pure hindsight but if you look at

132
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,520
what I want to show you in this teaching

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,919
and go back to the analysis during the

134
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,660
time when we are looking at the market

135
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,940
like this you'll see the levels that I

136
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,460
had given on the chart index they're all

137
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,380
there okay

138
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,000
so we're going to take a look at every

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
one of these examples with the exception

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,139
of the 58 pip CentralBankDealersRange because that's a NYX we don't do

142
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,000
anything for that particular day

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,039
but we will comment on that

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,240
when we get to that second example

145
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
okay so let's go out to a daily chart

146
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,199
and I'm going to ask you what do you see

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,320
here

148
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,680
okay I'm drawing your attention to a

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
specific level with that little trend

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
line Blue Line

151
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
and that's the segment of price action

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,940
that we're looking at in terms of those

153
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220
examples

154
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,139
and highlight that little area in this

155
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,100
white box

156
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,139
okay so we're looking at this whole

157
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,479
entire reference point here

158
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,800
and again I'm going to count you to go

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,060
back to the time

160
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,460
when we were talking about the cable and

161
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,680
Analysis and all of the charts that were

162
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,639
shared

163
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,440
okay go back and look at that so none of

164
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,919
this stuff is cherry picking okay

165
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,780
so what we're doing is we're looking at

166
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
the marketplace using the PD array

167
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,699
Matrix and we're blending it with time

168
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,800
and price Theory so we're looking at if

169
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,500
the data ranges we're looking at PD

170
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,060
array Matrix are we in a premium

171
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,699
discount the market trades down in the

172
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,400
lower range of that white rectangle

173
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,460
until it hits a bullish order block

174
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,080
what I've done there is I've taken the

175
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,419
Sunday candle and the Monday candle

176
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,120
blending that small little Sunday candle

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,220
and Monday candle

178
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,759
into one candle blending the two bodies

179
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,740
together and I got a measurement of that

180
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,560
and I projected it across the chart and

181
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,759
you can actually go back and look at

182
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,759
your notes and look at the Forum and I

183
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,500
counsel you to download the charts every

184
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,660
day I do them because you can keep track

185
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,880
and see that I don't make any changes I

186
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,740
don't go back and re-edit them you get

187
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,599
them as I see it so that way you can

188
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,099
compare what I'm explaining to you here

189
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,560
was exactly outlined in terms of the PD

190
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,259
arrays specifically I even tell you

191
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,819
that's a mean threshold of a bull

192
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,319
shoulder block there

193
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,639
so

194
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,500
price hits that level

195
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,819
creates the first of three up candles

196
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:57,840
and now we're going to go into those

197
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,460
examples and break it down

198
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,479
okay folks

199
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,520
okay here we are we're at that point

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
where

201
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,220
this stuff starts to get really really

202
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,539
interesting

203
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,039
so

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,860
when we look at these examples okay this

205
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,960
is where the price has traded up into a

206
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,599
premium on the daily chart

207
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,759
and we did our

208
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,740
StandardDeviation

209
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,199
okay and

210
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
we see price that was on a daily chart

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,660
in a premium at this time

212
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,299
we have a

213
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,860
bullish candle right for the download

214
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,179
here that gives us a bearish order block

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,859
that low comes in at

216
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,800
125.93

217
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,360
the high comes in at

218
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,060
125.97 so it trades up into the body of

219
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,620
the bear shoulder block

220
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,220
StandardDeviation of two

221
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,440
price extends up to the Standard

222
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Deviation

223
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,500
right to the PIP

224
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,180
and starts to trade off for the rest of

225
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,420
the day

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,760
when we have the StandardDeviation

227
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
arrived at

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,420
based on a PD array in other words we're

229
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,339
looking at a

230
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,120
premium PD array they are shorter block

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,360
price in a daily premium

232
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,940
hits it in London have a protractionary

233
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,040
state in the marketplace due to swing in

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
London

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,420
goes right to the PIP And Trades lower

236
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,380
the question is is how low will it go

237
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,000
well you have to look at the range that

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,620
is created by the CentralBankDealersRange protractionary state in other

240
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
words how much of a StandardDeviation

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,220
did we see

242
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,220
because that becomes the known range to

243
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,120
work with

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,640
and it becomes our multiplier as well

245
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,320
so when the market looks to fill the

246
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,820
numbers and I'll tell you what that

247
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,260
means when we get to it

248
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,839
we use this reference point here so it

249
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,640
has to actually the actual Standard

250
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,080
Deviation range

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,660
that we use for the CentralBankDealersRange and all the StandardDeviation it

253
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,760
uses to make the high or LOD

254
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
in London that becomes your measurement

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay so

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,240
what we have here is the market showing

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,640
us a midnight

258
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
in NewYork candle vertical line and

259
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,120
then 1800 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon

260
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
NewYork time and again each day

261
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,660
midnight NewYork two o'clock in the

262
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,040
afternoon midnight NewYork two o'clock

263
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,080
in the afternoon midnight NewYork two

264
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,279
o'clock in the afternoon

265
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,519
okay and I'm going to give you the

266
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,560
London killZone

267
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,820
reference point now

268
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
and this is that Weekly I'm sorry daily

269
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,800
premium PD array here

270
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,600
so price trades up into it

271
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,480
and starts to sell off so in this time

272
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,399
element here this gives us our London

273
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,160
close time of the day so

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,620
this candle here starts it

275
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,260
this is the middle of the London Kill

276
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,660
Zone close

277
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,019
and we have this candle here right there

278
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,440
that creates the  the projected London

279
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,700
close

280
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,800
time window but then we have ultimately

281
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,779
two o'clock where we actually see the

282
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,360
close of

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,640
our highest point in other words usually

284
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,620
the higher low even when a really long

285
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
winded trending day two o'clock usually

286
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,360
caps the

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,220
higher LOD if we if we

288
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,920
continue through London close Killzone

289
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,019
or basically if we go past noon NewYork

290
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,000
time  we look forward to go to two

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,579
o'clock and dribble down or run up until

292
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,860
that that specific time of the day

293
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,240
so all of these days we don't have

294
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
anything on this day here because the

295
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,980
CentralBankDealersRange was 58 Pips

296
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,800
regardless if we used to Wix as a high

297
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,959
and low or if we use the body's high and

298
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,519
low it doesn't make a difference the

299
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,560
point is it's still too much of a

300
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,300
CentralBankDealersRange to use for

301
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
our projections in here so we have to

302
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,019
skip on this day here but we use other

303
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,720
tools which we'll explain in a moment

304
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,820
 the daily bullish order block price

305
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,620
trades down into that on this big

306
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,959
CentralBankDealersRange day trades

307
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,700
down into the bullish order block here

308
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,940
and finds momentum to trade higher and

309
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,680
we have the scenario we would expect to

310
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,740
see price move higher on a bullish

311
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,320
discount PD array

312
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,180
and the same thing here continuing up

313
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,339
looking to close in

314
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,200
our gaps over here which we'll look at

315
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,279
in a moment

316
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
so when we have this range here price

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
point moves into a projectionary state

318
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,480
about two StandardDeviation what you

319
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,200
do is you take that range

320
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,620
and yes I do all this by hand okay so we

321
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,420
have our range

322
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,060
and just lay that on the bottom

323
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,040
of the CentralBankDealersRange and

324
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,700
you start layering layering them down

325
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,519
hold down control drag your

326
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,800
image away click on it and drag away

327
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,139
with the control button held down

328
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
right there

329
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,260
okay so we have

330
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,180
to blend two things now time and price

331
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,760
Theory so we're looking for this whole

332
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,139
range of two StandardDeviation

333
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,060
projected from the CentralBankDealersRange low but it's going to be a bearish

335
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,500
day so we have one StandardDeviation of

336
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
the total StandardDeviation used for

337
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,459
the CentralBankDealersRange to call

338
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,779
the HOD

339
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,820
so we have one of those Standard

340
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,680
Deviation to their StandardDeviation

341
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,720
three of their StandardDeviation why

342
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,700
AM I doing three is because price kept

343
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,160
going lower lower lower until we get to

344
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,100
the time of day right in here okay so

345
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm going to draw

346
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,860
a vertical line

347
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,980
delineating the beginning and the end

348
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,380
of the killZone

349
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,779
we'll put it on the close rather so this

350
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,139
candle closes it at noon this is 11 and

351
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,940
it starts as early as 10 o'clock in New

352
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,320
York time

353
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,160
okay and we have this projected low

354
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,700
so I'm going to use this line here

355
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,200
and yes the charts will look a little

356
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,220
bit busy for a moment

357
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,500
and we'll project this out in time

358
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,720
Okay so

359
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
we could take profit here on this day

360
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,480
the low comes in at

361
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
124.76

362
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,060
with the close on that candle it stops

363
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,519
right at two StandardDeviation of the

364
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,139
CentralBankDealersRange right there

365
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,279
you see that

366
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,459
boom hits it okay yes it Wicks down a

367
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,800
little bit more and let you see it

368
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
a little bit more than that but not by

369
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,560
much

370
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,940
okay and now we're going to look at the

371
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,860
1800 which is the cap of the day

372
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,220
there's the low and there's our

373
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,660
projected low right here

374
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,519
124.40

375
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,620
we called 124 41 so I was off by one pit

376
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,839
okay so time wise we looked for it to

377
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
occur here

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,660
it just fell a little bit short but had

379
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,800
to go one more StandardDeviation

380
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,480
because it kept drifting lower so

381
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
there's nothing wrong with just taking

382
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,139
profits here and leaving something on

383
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,060
for the rest of the day because there's

384
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,339
a discount PD array of a bullish order

385
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,019
block down here that we saw on the

386
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,459
previous slide

387
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,440
that would be your objective but you can

388
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,079
take profits time of day wise here with

389
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,839
two StandardDeviation of the CentralBankDealersRange two Standard

391
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,440
Deviation used to make the high of the

392
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,300
day so again in summary we're taking the

393
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,180
total range used of all the Standard

394
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,860
Deviation one

395
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,079
two three accounting CentralBankDealersRange always

397
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,279
so we have three of them so we get a

398
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,959
mock-up of that range and then project

399
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,959
it from the low on Sell days is one two

400
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,300
three it gives you the  if the

401
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,800
projected DailyRange low

402
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,579
okay I'm going to take this off

403
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,120
okay and we can't do anything with this

404
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,440
one here

405
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
um we'll have to wait get new

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,339
information and the next day here we

407
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,540
have our criteria here where it's a

408
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,100
small enough range of CentralBankDealersRange we do one Standard

410
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,760
Deviation down

411
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,440
why are we going down one Standard

412
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,540
Deviation because we have the bullish

413
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,760
order blocks in here and an old bullet

414
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,800
order block back here

415
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,019
price trades down into it clears out

416
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,820
even the rejection block which would be

417
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,620
the bodies of the candle sweeps through

418
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,139
that in London one StandardDeviation

419
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,620
misses it by two Pips okay so this is

420
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,880
going to be a time where you just don't

421
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,040
get it exactly but it's still calm one

422
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,259
StandardDeviation so we get a range

423
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,220
okay of these two together

424
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,560
so what you do

425
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,759
I'll borrow this

426
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,220
okay I'm getting a measurement of that

427
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,540
total range

428
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,099
it's almost the same thing actually it's

429
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,559
pretty interesting

430
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,579
okay so we have one

431
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,780
two

432
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,020
okay two projected StandardDeviation

433
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,939
up

434
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,040
that gives us a projected High

435
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,540
and I'm going to tell you why I stopped

436
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,559
here

437
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,120
before you start thinking oh you're

438
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,780
cherry picking

439
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,940
okay so we have the projected High

440
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,020
called here notice that this Wick right

441
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,419
here goes through our projected idea of

442
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,980
where price should go

443
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,820
but this one stops right to the pit

444
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,440
here's our time when and when it starts

445
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
on this candle so it's a little bit

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,820
early one hour early making the

447
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,799
well not one hour early but in the nine

448
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,299
o'clock hour of NewYork time it made

449
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,220
the HOD then 10 o'clock it

450
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,780
made this candle's High

451
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,720
11 and then noon here

452
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
why did it go up to this level here

453
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,980
forget the time element because you're

454
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,120
never going to have that perfectly but

455
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,160
it just gives us a ballpark figure time

456
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,600
wise when they anticipate the move to

457
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,820
unfold but I want you to look back over

458
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,580
here we have a candle it makes a low and

459
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,559
the close comes off that low

460
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,660
by a little bit then this candle opens

461
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,120
trades up a little bit so all this buy

462
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,020
side delivery vacancy okay or void of

463
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,940
buy side delivery it's only sell side

464
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,120
delivery begins at this candle's low

465
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,000
okay at 125.26

466
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,940
so from this candle's High here

467
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,419
at

468
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,460
2503 to this candle's low

469
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,400
at 25.26

470
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,419
we have 23 Pips of range to close in

471
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,460
right out to this point here

472
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,400
so we can look at that

473
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,780
like this

474
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,780
here is the fair value Gap that needs to

475
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,760
be closed in it does it right there and

476
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
goes Just A fifth or two above it

477
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
closing in this fair value Gap from this

478
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
high

479
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,000
to this low so it closes that in

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,220
so there's a reasonable expectation for

481
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,480
us to take profit there because we want

482
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,280
to get out early anyway but that's why

483
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,740
it went to that price point using the PD

484
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,900
arrays okay so nothing's changed there's

485
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
no

486
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,740
home you know new Hocus Pocus it's all

487
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
stuff that you've learned but now we're

488
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,700
applying it with great deal of precision

489
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,580
and using time elements okay so we went

490
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,340
two StandardDeviation up if we were to

491
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,120
go three

492
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,100
if we went 3 up that would took us up to

493
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,960
the bear shoulder block but we were

494
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,580
getting close to the time window so

495
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,140
while we could have expected this to

496
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,100
occur

497
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,780
two is about right because we're going

498
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
to close in the fair value Gap as we

499
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,840
were running up here

500
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,140
and it came late in the day on NewYork

501
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,419
for London close overlap so that's why

502
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,700
we'd expect to see price Peter out at

503
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,720
that point

504
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,220
again here we have

505
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,440
two StandardDeviation down

506
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,539
it goes right to the PIP

507
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,220
so we get a measurement of this tire

508
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,720
range of two StandardDeviation for

509
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
that particular day

510
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,220
okay so we have our range defined

511
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,120
so you have that one

512
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
and two

513
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,100
okay so we have two potential Standard

514
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,419
Deviation up

515
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,240
and also when price trades down two

516
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,620
StandardDeviation what we're actually

517
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,179
seeing is it trades down to another

518
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,919
discount PD array

519
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,500
which is these three consecutive Down

520
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,299
Candles

521
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,740
all we're going to do is extend this

522
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,380
over and you'll see the overlap

523
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,900
boom

524
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,320
okay so price trades down hits it

525
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,220
the opening on this candle is 124.36 the

526
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,340
low on this candle is

527
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,440
124.36 precision

528
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
two StandardDeviation okay and as a

529
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,039
general rule of thumb I like to always

530
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,900
throw two on just to see what would line

531
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,660
up so on the first one we see price

532
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,080
could reach up to

533
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,020
this fair value Gap in here so this

534
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,980
candle

535
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,200
hi and this candle low we left a little

536
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
bit of

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,520
sell side delivery only so as a buy side

538
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,159
liquidity void that we can see it trade

539
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,659
up into it's more specifically this

540
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,400
candle not this one I'm sorry this

541
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,659
candle here

542
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,240
so we can look at that

543
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,980
frame that out

544
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,600
here

545
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,460
okay so in this day price trades up

546
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,559
here's the noon

547
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,039
close of London this candle right here

548
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,799
trades up closes in

549
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,260
to the bearish order block it goes

550
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,480
inside of the second Deviation so while

551
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
there still may be some range permitted

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,820
based on the projections it's the PD

553
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,039
arrays that call the shot okay just it's

554
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,620
not the magic of these projections these

555
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,020
projections will lead you to

556
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,080
an overlap of time and price so we're

557
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,820
looking at the extension of the range

558
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,740
two StandardDeviation measure that

559
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,320
projected above from the eight 

560
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,000
consolidation of the CentralBankDealersRange High

562
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,020
we place that on there one Standard

563
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,880
Deviation that one alone would have been

564
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
enough and you could have took profits

565
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,340
right there

566
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,020
and that would be fine and just left

567
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,340
that little piece on there for the fair

568
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,900
value got The Fill in and let the rest

569
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,700
of the people chase that

570
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,039
the second one you can have a little

571
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,720
piece of one still

572
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,340
once it closes in the fair value Gap

573
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,659
again you would take another portion of

574
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,340
your trade-off and then see if it has

575
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,799
any room to trade higher

576
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,799
ultimately it never does but that's the

577
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,659
that's the way you'd use it in order to

578
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,059
read from the London close

579
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,280
Killzone when they cut lows Killzone

580
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,740
that includes killZone the Standard

581
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,960
Deviation range from the Central Bank

582
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,940
range per tractionary state in other

583
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,919
words how many StandardDeviation go up

584
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,799
that's your key okay that's the thing

585
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,039
that makes IPDA reach for it now it will

586
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,460
go those many blocks down until it

587
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,280
reaches the time of day where

588
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
we expect the range to cap that means

589
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,299
it's if it's a NewYork  session

590
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,100
reversal like we see here now we're not

591
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,539
using the range here because the Central

592
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,780
Bank dealer's range is too too extended

593
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,360
but price trades down into a NewYork

594
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,520
session reversal because it hits a daily

595
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
bullish order block

596
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,780
and then that's our weekly low and price

597
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,299
has a slightly bullish day intraday on

598
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,820
the next day and then we have our setup

599
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,240
going into the

600
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,700
rally on March 30th

601
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,320
trading down into a rejection blockable

602
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
shoulder block overlap and then two

603
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,580
StandardDeviation up Nails it now we

604
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,080
didn't get the exact

605
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,500
Range High in here but using the

606
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,900
fair value Gap in here and we've got you

607
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,400
real close two Pips away from it so you

608
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,960
can't argue about that that's sometimes

609
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,460
you're going to be right to the PIP

610
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,020
sometimes you'll be just short one or

611
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,760
two Pips and other times it'll be just

612
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,980
maybe five or six Pips above and there's

613
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,059
nothing wrong with leaving a little bit

614
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,320
of that on the table and if you're

615
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,419
looking for that always I'm not going to

616
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,620
be able to help you with that measure of

617
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,480
precision

618
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,940
so by blending these things like this

619
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,400
it gives us an overlap of Central Bank

620
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,299
dealers range projections okay and let

621
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,980
me remind you that the Precision really

622
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,640
is on the entry side of the low on the

623
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
BuyDays and the high on the Sell days

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,260
that's the StandardDeviation  tactic

625
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,900
now where this will get you in trouble

626
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,520
is you're going to try to apply the

627
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,320
StandardDeviation based on the range

628
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,120
between two o'clock in the afternoon and

629
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,799
8 PM NewYork time you're going to try

630
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,179
to do it every single day and you're

631
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,679
going to forget about the importance of

632
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,360
having a range between 20 and 30 Pips

633
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,400
for the CentralBankDealersRange it

634
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,679
has to be less than 40. and you have to

635
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,960
have a DirectionalBias remember we were

636
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
in a premium up here we saw a price

637
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,980
coming down to a discount PD array which

638
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,600
is the bullish order block recently

639
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
expected to bounce bounce it does okay

640
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,740
so to get into buy side

641
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,020
boom one StandardDeviation now I could

642
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,059
have done two StandardDeviation okay

643
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,280
and trade down below these Wicks could

644
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,380
have done that but it already hit this

645
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,900
order block and we found this low in

646
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,020
here the body's equal in here we swept

647
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,880
it didn't get quite down there no

648
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,179
problem big deal even if you missed this

649
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,400
move look at this one here you make up

650
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,840
for it the next day

651
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,080
is it a trade every single day no

652
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,240
that's what I'm trying to show you by

653
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,039
sitting down with you every single

654
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,779
trading day and using the things that

655
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,640
you've learned thus far in the order

656
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,140
that you've been learning them you can

657
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,539
see that it doesn't equate to getting

658
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,640
money every single day now some of you

659
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,159
are in here using other tools and using

660
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,260
things of your own  in your own

661
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,360
discovery of my tools and such and

662
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,919
you'll be able to find some setups

663
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,559
that's fine that's great but when we do

664
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,480
live sessions I don't want folks trying

665
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,980
to call out what they think is going to

666
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,480
happen unless I'm specifically asking

667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,279
you because I'm trying to keep the

668
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,100
learning curve basically everyone in the

669
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,600
same mindset

670
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,580
because if I can hold you all

671
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,679
collectively as long as I can in that

672
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,679
mindset you'll hopefully learn in its

673
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,260
closest way possible step by step with

674
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,279
each other

675
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,480
and some of you are a little bit more

676
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,860
advanced because you've been using my

677
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,760
stuff a little bit longer than the

678
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,039
mentorship started but a lot of us are

679
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,620
in here are talking for the first time

680
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,799
and we're using the content you know in

681
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,440
a graduate modular State and this is the

682
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,260
way you learn it so by blending these

683
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,539
things again this has nothing to do with

684
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,919
Elliott wave it doesn't have anything of

685
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,919
supply and demand it's all interpanc

686
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,580
delivery okay so this is the science if

687
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,440
you will behind IPDA calling the daily

688
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,200
high and low please

689
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,080
please understand that this is something

690
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,820
that should not be out there on YouTube

691
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,520
if you see this on YouTube send me an

692
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,220
email at Inner Circle Trader gmail.com

693
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,140
tell me that's on there send me the link

694
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,419
and I will flag it and have YouTube take

695
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,279
it down none of you would have

696
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,659
permission none of you have permission

697
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,580
to post this anywhere and I certainly

698
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,679
don't want to post it on online video

699
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,840
hosting mediums or meet available to

700
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,640
other people so

701
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
it's just too good to be out there in

702
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,380
the public I debated whether or not I

703
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,940
wasn't even going to include this if

704
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,080
y'all would have kept it out you never

705
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
would have known it anyway but

706
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,000
you would have you would have missed how

707
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm pretty much calling the highs and

708
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,900
lows when there's specific times of the

709
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,760
day and Times of the week and Times of

710
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,159
the month where it lines up this is how

711
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,220
I do it so hopefully you found this 

712
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,600
insightful I'm sure some of you are

713
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,159
going to be nuts about it go through all

714
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,380
your charts and  this weekend will

715
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,419
probably be a very  light sleeping

716
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,760
week but I can assure you that this

717
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,320
isn't all there is we get a lot more

718
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,299
precise than this but there's some

719
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,679
things that you have to take in

720
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,440
consideration obviously if I gave this

721
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
on a YouTube video and mentioned  you

722
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,980
know all the things that we've learned

723
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,039
so far in the mentorship it still

724
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,720
wouldn't serve many people because they

725
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,580
would try to over use it they would try

726
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,260
to use it every single day they wouldn't

727
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,539
understand the PDA rate Matrix they

728
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,460
wouldn't understand the if the data

729
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,440
ranges they would just not have all the

730
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,020
insights that you have so

731
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,179
again this gets back to why it can't be

732
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,799
done in a video it can't be just one

733
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,299
video does it you have to have all the

734
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,039
stuff that's been taught thus far and

735
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,960
now you can see how they start to draw

736
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,000
together and there's some symmetry here

737
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,919
so now because we are understanding

738
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,980
these ranges we can take our Precision a

739
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,980
little bit more further and now start to

740
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,659
understand when we don't really want to

741
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,760
be taking specific day trades so now

742
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,799
instead of trading every single trading

743
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
day while I will be forced to try to do

744
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,940
it I will remind you based on these

745
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,520
rules that there is or is not the high

746
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,860
probability setup based on the Central

747
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,900
Bank dealers range being in an area of

748
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,380
discount or premium and

749
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,720
we're not in a Range that is conducive

750
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,120
in other words 2030 is ideal in terms of

751
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,500
Pips for the CentralBankDealersRange

752
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,140
if it's bigger than that we have a

753
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,000
harder time getting these measurements

754
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,799
okay so remember it goes back to Power

755
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,419
Three average DailyRange is about 100

756
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,580
Pips not always but generally and we

757
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,620
look for an average about 33 Pips for a

758
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,240
protractionary state in London it

759
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,799
doesn't have to do that it can be just

760
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,440
six Pips okay but generally we allow up

761
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,620
to 33 but if we have a central bank

762
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,299
deals range that's greater than 40 Pips

763
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,580
it usually messes up the synchronization

764
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,340
for the London open killZone so

765
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,659
hopefully you found this insightful

766
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,000
please do not share it please don't be

767
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,980
your best friend to somebody else and

768
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,559
give this out to someone keep it to your

769
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,020
close to your vest don't share it trust

there for everyone else to know you paid

772

for it be greedy with it there's nothing

773
