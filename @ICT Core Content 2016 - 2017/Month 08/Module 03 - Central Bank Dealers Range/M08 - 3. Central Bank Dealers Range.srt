1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,880
okay folks welcome back this is lesson

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,359
three of the April 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,420
content this month we're teaching ICT

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,800
day trading model

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,779
and this teaching is specifically

6
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,420
teaching CentralBankDealersRange

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,019
foreign

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,260
okay for CentralBankDealersRange I'm

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,820
going to assume

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,700
you've already went through my YouTube

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,320
tutorial dealing with the essential Bank

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
dealers range

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
but

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,059
if you haven't gone through it this

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,200
one's going to pretty much teach you

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,000
everything you should have gleaned from

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,460
that lesson anyway but

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
we're going to assume for a moment that

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,280
you have an understanding of

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,860
StandardDeviation

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,280
now first we have to have a

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,799
range or a

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,200
number or a level in terms of a central

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,720
focal point and then it has to deviate

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,580
above it or below it to give us our

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900
Deviation

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,479
well essential Bank dealers range is a

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,860
specific time of the day we're going to

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,740
teach in this lesson but for now I want

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,400
you to think about ranges in terms of a

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,380
predefined higher low

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,680
foreign

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,180
box here represents the Central Bank

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,439
dealer's range and I'll get into the

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,579
specifics and show you what it looks

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,159
like in the chart but for now we have to

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,420
know

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,119
conceptually if there's a range that we

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,780
have deemed a specific important range

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,920
in price

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,500
once we determine that

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,640
that range height from high to low based

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,200
on two different types of parameters

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,540
which we'll go over

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,320
that measurement of price range in terms

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,160
of Pips can be reproduced or replicated

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,139
if you will in the form of a Standard

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,940
Deviation

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,160
one StandardDeviation above and below

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
would be the same range

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,540
added to

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,640
the high the Central Bank dealer's range

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,860
and one StandardDeviation is the same

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,840
range that makes the Central Bank

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,959
dealer's range and total range in terms

56
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,840
of Pips and we subtract that range

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,060
from the Central Bank dealer's range low

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,920
and that would give us one Standard

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,959
Deviation above it and one Standard

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,520
Deviation below it

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,840
that range would be added to the high of

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,000
the first StandardDeviation

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,519
and subtract it from the low of the

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,099
first StandardDeviation below

65
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,640
giving us the second StandardDeviation

66
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,920
and this would go one

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
replicating that Central Bank dealer's

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,680
range with StandardDeviation one two

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,580
three and four

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,819
typically most Sell days will create the

71
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,739
HOD

72
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,900
from the CentralBankDealersRange up

73
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,860
to

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,340
three StandardDeviation

75
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,220
most buy days will create the low of the

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,319
day from the CentralBankDealersRange

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,239
down to the third StandardDeviation

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,780
ideally sell dates create the high of a

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,840
day no more than two StandardDeviation

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
above the CentralBankDealersRange

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
many times just one StandardDeviation

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,400
ideal BuyDays

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,640
will create the LOD no less

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,739
than two StandardDeviation below the

85
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,920
central thing deals range and ideally

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,900
many times you'll see it just go one

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,099
StandardDeviation below the Central

88
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,840
Bank dealer's range creating the low of

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,760
the day

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,940
four StandardDeviation above for a

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,400
high today is going to be on the heels

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,360
of a very high impact news event for the

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,340
session in London

94
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,739
same thing is said on BuyDays if it

95
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,540
trades down to four StandardDeviation

96
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,340
usually it's going to be very high

97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,880
impactful news or price can come down or

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,978
go up to the fourth StandardDeviation

99
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,520
to create a NewYork session Market

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
reversal profile

101
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,580
okay dealing specifics with the Central

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,320
Bank dealers range

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,900
the time period that frames the Central

104
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,820
Bank dealers range is

105
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,800
2 PM to 8 PM NewYork time

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,400
the ideal range is less than 40 Pips

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
preferably the range should be no more

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,660
than 20 to 30 Pips in total range highly

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,440
low

110
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
so what are we saying here

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
between 2 PM

112
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,919
and 8 PM NewYork time regardless of

113
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,620
where you live globally you need to find

114
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,979
where your price charts indicate what

115
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,320
would be seen as the candle that starts

116
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,880
the 2PM

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,860
and 8 PM times in NewYork time

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,220
so for completeness sake and the sake of

119
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,199
avoiding all confusion

120
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,080
like everything else I always teach find

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
out what NewYork time is

122
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
where you're at geographically

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,919
and then find out what that looks like

124
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,380
in your platform for your charts and

125
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,900
delineate that with a vertical line

126
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,060
with 2 PM NewYork

127
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,240
and 8 PM NewYork

128
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,479
between those two time windows

129
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,580
the highest high and the lowest low

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,060
ideally should be less than 40 Pips

131
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,220
preferably 20 to 30 Pips total

132
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,680
range is larger than 30 Pips

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,300
can tend to be unfruitful for

134
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,960
projections

135
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,740
foreign

136
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,320
the range in Pips

137
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,620
by calibration from high to low or using

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,699
the wicks

139
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,400
or alternatively we can use the range in

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
the highest body and the lowest body as

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,780
well whatever the highest closing or

142
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,280
open price is

143
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,500
and we have the lowest close or open is

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,259
in between 8 PM and 2 PM NewYork time

145
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,000
now obviously we need to know

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,580
DirectionalBias for this to be any of

147
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,919
any assistance to us so it has to be

148
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,240
used in conjunction

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,340
for our projections to work the Central

150
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,680
Bank dealer's range strength is aiding

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,840
in the LOD or HOD

152
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,259
selection

153
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,240
that's the most important thing as a day

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,340
trader we can focus on if we can look

155
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,919
for the highest probable high or low of

156
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,360
the data form

157
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,120
or in terms of when markets are bullish

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,740
we're looking for the low of the data

159
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,919
form predominantly in the London session

160
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,199
so where is that low most likely going

161
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,080
to occur and is it going to be on a day

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,300
that's highly favorable for that event

163
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,639
to unfold remember I said many times

164
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,520
over the last seven years teaching Forex

165
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,639
online that I don't trade every single

166
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,380
day and even in this mentorship you've

167
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,840
seen that it's not productive to try to

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
trade every single trading day

169
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,639
but there are times we're going to learn

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,819
that there are highest probabilities for

171
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,160
a condition to be met for that higher

172
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,199
load of form in London when we have

173
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,699
these conditions

174
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,099
we can go in with reasonable expectation

175
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,120
that we have a good chance more than

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,520
most days that the high or low

177
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,680
will form in London and we can get a

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,319
ballpark idea where that lower high

179
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,460
should form

180
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,740
using the CentralBankDealersRange so

181
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,680
the CentralBankDealersRange

182
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,440
main focus is to help you

183
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,860
find the high or LOD

184
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,039
in respective bullish repair stays in

185
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,960
other words if we're bullish on the

186
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,680
market

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,539
as a whole or if we're looking for one

188
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,400
shot one kill for the week that's

189
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,740
predominantly expected to go up for the

190
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,539
for a Friday close higher than where it

191
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,120
opened up on Sunday

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,500
for instance if we're looking for one

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,780
shot one kill in a bullish week we're

194
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,879
going to be looking primarily for low of

195
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,039
the day in London each day Tuesday

196
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,560
Wednesday and Thursday preferably those

197
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,080
days but it could occur on Monday as

198
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,279
well

199
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,958
but we're looking for the LOD

200
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,659
to form in London in that criteria but

201
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,979
just because we're looking for the low

202
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,958
of the form and be a bullish close every

203
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,059
single day doesn't mean this highest

204
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,339
probability setup and we can use the

205
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,839
CentralBankDealersRange to help frame

206
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,399
that context

207
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,240
as we'll teach in this lesson here

208
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,820
but we're using Wix in this example here

209
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,980
so every one of these blue boxes

210
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,660
represents the Central Bank dealers

211
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,160
range for that respective day

212
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
now this chart represents the Central

213
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Bank dealer's range with using the

214
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,940
bodies now I will have to admit to you I

215
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,680
like to use the bodies predominantly

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,320
because the Wicks are always going to

217
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,080
show erroneous price because of your

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
dealing spread through your broker

219
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,339
everyone's going to have a disparity

220
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,440
between their high and their low on

221
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,300
every candle it's never going to agree

222
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,440
so what I use is the bulk of the trading

223
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,860
which is the body that in my opinion and

224
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,480
there's no real Tennessee of y'all

225
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,700
end-all answer for this but my

226
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,120
 studies over the last two decades is

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
if we focus primarily on the bodies of

228
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,260
the candles we're going to get more

229
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,200
closer to what smart money is doing in

230
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,240
relative terms than if we use just the

231
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
Wix now we can get a lot of feedback in

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
terms of what retail is doing if we

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,019
study Wix but if we study the bodies of

234
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,120
the candles and we frame our ranges with

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
that we'll get more clear pictures about

236
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,100
what the institutional accumulation

237
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,959
distribution ranges are going to be when

238
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,240
we use the CentralBankDealersRange

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,220
so as you can see here each one of these

240
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,580
ranges has its respective ranges in

241
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,180
terms of Pips the first is 13 Pips the

242
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,040
next is 58 Pips

243
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,800
the Nexus 19 and the last in this

244
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,660
example is 16 Pips in range

245
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,880
so using the bodies we're going to focus

246
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
primarily on that now

247
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,019
before I go into greater detail I want

248
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,420
you to think about

249
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,220
just because I like using the bodies and

250
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,680
I think it's got the most Advantage we

251
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,540
still have to look at the ranges with

252
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,240
the Wicks included okay so let's take a

253
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,339
closer look at each example here

254
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,980
for this first one we have replicated

255
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,880
that

256
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,800
CentralBankDealersRange the little

257
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,860
blue shaded area and we duplicate that

258
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,320
range and projected up one Standard

259
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,940
Deviation that was that's what the one

260
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,839
SD stands for so one StandardDeviation

261
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,000
and

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,760
second StandardDeviation which is just

263
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
basically CentralBankDealersRange

264
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,440
total pip range or in that case 13 Pips

265
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,200
we added 13 Pips more and then added 13

266
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,899
Pips Morse for a total Standard

267
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,860
Deviation of two

268
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,660
notice how it takes your rate to

269
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,000
the HOD formed in London

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,459
that particular session immediately

271
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,579
after the CentralBankDealersRange

272
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:31,380
closes so in other words at 8 PM

273
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,600
starting the Asian range

274
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,100
project that

275
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,660
range that we created for Central Bank

276
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,720
dealers range two StandardDeviation up

277
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,880
that gives us the projected London high

278
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,740
now it does not mean it's going to call

279
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,300
it to the PIP it might go a little bit

280
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,279
above it it might fall a little short of

281
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
it but it gives us a range to look for

282
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,860
the next one in our example here the

283
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,839
range is 58 Pips

284
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,000
now this is too large our rules state

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,279
that we want to have 40 Pips or less

286
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,700
ideally 20 to 30 Pips so this particular

287
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
trading day we have to allow the market

288
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
to do whatever it wants to do if we're

289
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
going to scalp that's another thing but

290
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,820
for day trading we can't use this

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,800
criteria because it's too large of a

292
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
central bank dealer's range and this is

293
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,220
not what I taught in the free teaching

294
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,200
on my YouTube channel but when you're

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,579
using CentralBankDealersRange

296
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,920
projections highs and lows the criteria

297
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,459
is 2030 is ideal in terms of Pips it has

298
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,519
to be less than 40 generally but ideal

299
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,880
ranges are 20 to 30 Pips High and

300
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,860
the reason why is if the average daily

301
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,720
range of the candle for the daily chart

302
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
that you're trading is typically around

303
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,220
100 Pips a site now they're not always

304
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,260
100 Pips but I like to use as a ballpark

305
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,380
figure general rule of thumb if we have

306
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,260
a hundred Pips one third of that is

307
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,720
around 33 Pips so that's why I give

308
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,899
about 20 to 30 Pips ideal scenario  it

309
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,579
won't you want to be less than 40 Pips

310
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,220
for that reason so for Power3 

311
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,380
concept to unfold if we're bullish we're

312
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,300
looking for the opening price and then

313
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,459
the market to trade down 20 to 30 Pips

314
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,519
ideally no more than 33 Pips

315
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,760
if it trades beyond that we don't want

316
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,779
to

317
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,940
see it trade more than 40 Pips it

318
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,680
doesn't mean it can't but ideal

319
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,380
scenarios the the drop down from the

320
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,660
opening price on accumulation days where

321
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,579
the low the day is formed and we have a

322
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,440
higher close bullish

323
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,139
we're looking for that 20 to 30 pip drop

324
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,880
down and we can use the Central Bank

325
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,920
dealers range to confirm that with other

326
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,060
things that we'll teach in the next

327
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,480
lesson

328
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,200
the next

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,820
example here we have one Standard

330
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,000
Deviation projected below it

331
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
and

332
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,320
you can see we just about hit that but

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,639
it was definitely inside the first

334
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,800
StandardDeviation creating the low of

335
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,260
the day and price trades up aggressively

336
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,220
next example we have one Standard

337
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,300
Deviation

338
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,940
projected below

339
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,240
and a second StandardDeviation

340
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,519
projected below so now we have two

341
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,320
StandardDeviation below the Central

342
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,760
Bank dealers range for this particular

343
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
day

344
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,060
and it takes us right down to the low of

345
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,220
the day it was only off by one pivot

346
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,740
went below one pip and then we saw the

347
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,079
low that they formed in London

348
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,760
looking at this

349
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,279
obviously you know it looks like cherry

350
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,320
picking hindsight and all that business

351
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,300
but I want you to take in consideration

352
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,820
when we look at price

353
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,500
we have to have a bias what do we think

354
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,420
price is going to do is price going to

355
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,040
go higher or lower

356
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,500
over the next two or three days

357
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,060
what's the price most likely going to do

358
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,860
over the course of this present week or

359
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,600
next week is going to go higher is it

360
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,279
going to go lower

361
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,100
where are we at seasonally

362
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,019
are we looking for bullish prices or

363
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,279
lower prices

364
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,320
where are we at quarterly are we in a

365
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,180
quarterly shift that is underway that's

366
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,699
still unfolding with bullish prices with

367
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,560
premium PD arrays that haven't been met

368
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
yet

369
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
if that's the case then we could be

370
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,980
looking for scenarios to look for

371
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,839
Buys so we're looking at discount PD

372
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,699
arrays we're looking at reasons to

373
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,160
suggest buying in a discount range so

374
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,500
our PDA array Matrix is going to help us

375
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,079
look for reasons to build ideas that are

376
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,980
bullish

377
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,519
if we look for those ideas with the

378
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,720
CentralBankDealersRange in

379
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,639
conjunction with those it'll help us

380
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,800
narrow down with time of day London and

381
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,740
open it'll help us frame ideal entry

382
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,920
point

383
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,500
so if we look at the daily chart and we

384
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,480
see price trading up at a premium PD

385
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
array and markets are bearish we're

386
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,620
looking for lower prices for one shot

387
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,180
one kill scenario looking for a lower

388
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,440
close week

389
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,860
we could be looking for one two or three

390
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,339
StandardDeviation moved higher

391
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,019
when the CentralBankDealersRange is

392
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,660
around 20 to 30 Pips ideally

393
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,240
and if we get that projection up into

394
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,360
London we have a great deal of advantage

395
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,279
on our side that we're probably going to

396
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,079
get the HOD in the London

397
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,040
session

398
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,459
now you add that also with your

399
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,399
expectation of

400
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,560
seasonal Tendencies all of those things

401
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,720
start coming together and draw a closer

402
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,519
picture to what institutional order flow

403
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,820
is and how IPDA moves price in the next

404
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,959
lesson we're going to go into greater

405
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,639
detail about how we can pick the high

406
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,839
and the LOD with this

407
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,120
information and with the Asian range
