1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,420
okay folks welcome back to lesson six

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,140
of the April 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,779
this month is ICT day trading model this

4
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,340
lesson is when to avoid the London

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,580
session

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,000
okay this lesson is going to be

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,239
completely void of any charts any kind

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,579
of examples any kind of distractions

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,800
because I want you to think about

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
the characteristics that I'm outlining

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
here it's not a long lesson but it's

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,379
very very important I want to make it

13
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,760
separate apart from everything else

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,100
because many of you look at the charts

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,899
and you try to question why I'm drawing

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,820
a line here or I'm highlighting this or

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,860
why is this time feeling either there

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,020
and why is it not this I want you to

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,300
think about the things I'm outlining in

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,040
this lesson

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
from a conceptual or characteristic

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,900
Viewpoint because they're not ambiguous

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,000
they're very specific things I look for

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,740
and these are the types of things I want

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,119
you to think about when you're going

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,920
into trading the London session for day

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
trades

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,680
so when is the London session not ideal

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
well typically after a large range day

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,240
which is greater than two times the

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,340
average five day range in other words if

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,299
you look at

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,759
the average DailyRange of a particular

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,659
pair

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,420
if you ever have a day prior to the day

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
you're wanting to day trade or trade it

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,400
on the session If the previous day or

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,759
previous trading day had a huge or large

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,979
range day that went greater than two

40
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,380
times its five day average DailyRange

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,700
on the day that it had the large range

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,299
day okay that is a day that you do not

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,240
want to trade immediately the day after

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,000
typically there'll be a consolidation or

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,960
it could go choppy

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,199
after a series of three consecutive up

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,080
closes on a daily chart you want to

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,300
avoid trading longs

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,640
at least in the London session because

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,620
typically you can get a retracement that

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,120
could be rather deep

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,180
creating a down close day on a candle on

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,360
the daily chart or a really long Wick

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
intraday and then maybe continuing in

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
the direction of the three consecutive

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,900
closes but generally after three up

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,920
closes

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,020
you're going to either get a pause or a

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,739
retracement lower

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
after a series of three consecutive down

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,980
closes on a daily chart

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,080
you want to be avoiding London shorts

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,879
and again just the same thing we just

64
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,379
mentioned with three consecutive up

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,200
closes as a daily chart would indicate

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
many times when you see three

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,980
consecutive down closes on a daily

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,739
trading short in London the next day or

69
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,840
the fourth trading day in a row many

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,060
times you can get caught up in a deep

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,640
retracement or it can go sideways

72
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,160
and it makes it not ideal for London

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,019
session

74
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,640
now with both of these conditions

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,620
outlined here three consecutive up

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,420
closes and three consecutive down closes

77
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,459
again that's relative to a daily time

78
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,300
frame

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,360
so if we see that criteria what that

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,420
will do is help filter out

81
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,220
when we have that situation generally

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,140
you won't see a big range day now it

83
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,819
doesn't mean it can't happen but it's

84
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,519
highly unlikely to occur on the fourth

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,000
trading day

86
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,959
after a FOMC event that produces extreme

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,099
whipsaw

88
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,140
now this could be

89
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,940
linked to the very first one I said as

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,680
well after a large range day greater

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,180
than two times its average DailyRange

92
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,340
on the five day basis

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,260
that can be

94
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,239
the factor that puts you on the

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,700
sidelines not trading London or if

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,500
there's an FOMC event that produces

97
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,200
extreme whipsaw it means that if there's

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
an interest rate announcement that comes

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,239
out

100
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,159
if they don't change his trades or if

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,480
they do change interest rates or it

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,980
wasn't just what they as high as they

103
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,420
thought it was going to go or low as it

104
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,819
thought whatever that

105
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,360
um

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
release is I don't care I don't care so

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
much about that what I want to say is

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,418
what was the action in The Marketplace

109
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,238
so if the FOMC event creates and

110
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,100
produces an extreme whipsaw up and down

111
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,560
generally FOMC comes out two o'clock in

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,060
the afternoon in NewYork time

113
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,979
so if we see that big whipsaw price

114
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,780
action that's going to mess up London

115
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,220
okay it's going to screw up the Central

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,080
Bank dealers range and possibly roll

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,340
right on into

118
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,620
the Asian session so just

119
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,560
avoid trading London open after FOMC

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,639
events that create whipsaw

121
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,300
ahead of non-farm payroll numbers

122
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,040
typically  the first Friday not always

123
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,419
but generally the first Friday of every

124
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,120
trading month we expect to see non-farm

125
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,080
payroll

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,940
if

127
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,919
we are looking for non-farm apparel to

128
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,919
occur we are not trading London session

129
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,300
at all on that Friday

130
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,120
now the same trading day

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,340
that's heading into a long weekend or a

132
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,580
holiday that day we avoid trading London

133
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,720
as well because it could be an early

134
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,300
leave a lot of Trades are going to go on

135
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,699
an early Escape From The Marketplace

136
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,900
and a lot of money is going to be

137
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,160
sitting on the sidelines now this is

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
going to be a hit and miss type thing

139
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,680
invariably you're going to be able to go

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,259
back and find instances where ICT look

141
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,900
at this it went 300 Pips okay going into

142
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,419
the holiday and it was a short day is it

143
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,860
going to happen possibly yeah sure it

144
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,139
was I mean anything can happen but we

145
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,360
trade in a world of probabilities and

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
statistical Edge so if we know that

147
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,720
historically the normal event is if

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
there's a day leading into a holiday

149
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
usually it's a Friday it could be a

150
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,660
Thursday generally you want to avoid

151
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,880
trading your London session because it's

152
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,139
going to probably be a quiet session

153
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,940
it's not worth taking on the risk

154
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,820
multiple High to medium impact news

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,860
drivers for that particular market so if

156
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,600
we look on the economic calendar you can

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
use Forex Factor you can use any other

158
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,979
reputable

159
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,900
economic calendar that tracks what news

160
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,880
releases or Market drivers that are

161
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
going to be released throughout the week

162
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,539
in each particular trading session for

163
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,160
every major pair

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
if we're looking at that for the London

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
session and we see multiple

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,699
high impact or medium impact events for

167
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,300
a particular currency that can spell a

168
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,120
pretty tricky London session not all the

169
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,460
time again there's always a caveat there

170
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,699
where it can happen but generally if we

171
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,620
see multiple drivers like for instance

172
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,180
maybe it's a two o'clock event that's

173
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,280
coming out and then at three o'clock

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,660
there's another one or maybe there's a

175
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,460
three o'clock event coming out and then

176
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,900
there's a five o'clock in that at five

177
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,940
o'clock in the morning event as well one

178
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,539
may be medium impact or one maybe a high

179
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,660
impact or they most they both may be 

180
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,220
one or the other in terms of medium or

181
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,919
high impact news if we see multiple

182
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,900
events due out on the economic calendar

183
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,120
for that particular pair it could be

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,500
problematic for your London session

185
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,860
trade okay so what we ideally look for

186
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,660
like we learned in the first portion of

187
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,639
this mentorship is we want to see

188
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,919
generally one high impact or medium

189
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,020
impact news event and that way we know

190
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,340
there's going to be probably one stage

191
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,139
of manipulation for that particular day

192
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,060
and then the profit release portion of

193
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,500
the day or the expansion of the daily

194
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,000
range will unfold going into NewYork

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,680
an absence of any news during London can

196
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
be a wild card day that means it could

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,060
go either way it could be a real easy

198
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,240
technical day where your profiles unfold

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,699
exactly as you expect or as we just

200
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,099
recently seen in the time of this

201
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,400
mentorship the UK prime minister came

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
out with a snap election decision right

203
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,120
on the heels of the holiday break and it

204
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,780
took the cable by storm so we had a 400

205
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,479
pip move in one trading day

206
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,419
for  the British pound USD

207
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,699
so and there was an absence completely

208
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,580
of any London time-based news events so

209
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,560
it was sprung on the market last minute

210
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,039
and then that was the result so there's

211
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,139
always some kind of a Black Swan

212
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,360
unexpected

213
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,520
didn't see it coming curveball and that

214
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,080
was when we just seen while we were

215
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,740
doing the mentorship

216
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,419
now what characteristics do I look for

217
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,640
to look for an avoidance of London

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
session the first one is the Central

219
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,719
Bank dealers range if it's greater than

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,540
50 Pips I'm already knowing first hand

221
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,580
i'm possibly going to pass on a London

222
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,899
session it doesn't mean it's a

223
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,899
guaranteed set in stone but if I have

224
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,459
plans the next day

225
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,459
if I have  you know plans with my

226
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,700
family and I want to be rested I'll just

227
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
not Pat I'll just pass on a London

228
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,899
session and even if it moves well I

229
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,640
won't even get up at midnight to see how

230
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,320
it sets up I'll just avoid the London

231
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,940
session altogether get a good night's

232
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,040
rest if I can and be rested and spend my

233
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,839
time with my family

234
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,839
if I don't have any plans the next day

235
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,300
going into the NewYork hours then I

236
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,339
will still wake up around midnight time

237
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,560
to see what the Asian range did and

238
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
that'll set up my decision factors like

239
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,100
we just learned in lesson five

240
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,300
if the agent range is greater than 40

241
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,060
Pips I'm going to consider the delayed

242
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,339
protraction profile

243
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,320
but it has to meet every one of those

244
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,440
criteria for it to unfold otherwise I'll

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,300
move to the sidelines and avoid trading

246
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,540
London

247
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,640
if the market starts to sustain Rally or

248
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,279
decline from 8 PM NewYork

249
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,380
that's usually a poor indication of a

250
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,899
London session that means that the real

251
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,380
event is started at zero DMT and they're

252
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,519
probably going to keep a sustained move

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,540
going through and very little

254
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,279
retracement usually the retracement will

255
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,320
occur if at all during a NewYork

256
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,620
session

257
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,600
if CentralBankDealersRange and or

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,540
Asian range is not visually and it means

259
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,120
obviously consolidating I'm going to

260
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,820
look to avoid the London session

261
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,160
so that means there has to be a

262
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
completely different Market profile from

263
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,440
that what we saw of the intraday price

264
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,060
action between the London open and

265
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,240
London close of the previous day so it

266
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
after 2 PM the previous day going into

267
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
8 PM if it isn't a quiet small little

268
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
consolidation range

269
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,779
that's not an ideal scenario it means

270
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,120
it's going to be a poor setup going into

271
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,000
London same thing with Asian range if

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
the Asian range gets really wild or

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,540
widens up

274
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,200
that again lessens the statistical Edge

275
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,079
that IPDA will give us by moving into a

276
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,579
protractionary state

277
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,760
right after midnight so

278
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,380
bottom line CentralBankDealersRange

279
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,279
and or Asian range must trade down into

280
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,980
small tight consolidation range if we

281
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
don't see that if it's trending in both

282
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,380
or either or it makes the London session

283
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,720
highly suspect and you'll know clearly

284
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,519
by looking at the time window that

285
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,839
creates the CentralBankDealersRange

286
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,060
and the Asian range if it's not in

287
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,260
consolidation or if it is in

288
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,880
consolidation

289
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,160
very clear obvious you'll see what I

290
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
mean by going through your charts and

291
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
going back over a 15 minute time frame

292
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,440
you'll see it clearly when it creates a

293
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
consolidation it looks very very

294
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,360
distinct small little narrow range in

295
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,700
contrast to all the previous days into

296
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,320
the action

297
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
if it's wide or erratic or trending in

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,300
either one of those ranges Central Bank

299
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,579
deals range are Asian it makes London

300
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,980
highly suspect and I don't want to trade

301
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,620
in those conditions

302
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,680
now we as Traders as a day trader we're

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,180
going to be aiming for days when the

304
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,640
banks will hold the market to build open

305
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,440
float and again that builds on the the

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,540
idea of the previous point

307
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,899
when we anticipate the banks holding the

308
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
market in a small tight consolidation

309
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,320
what they're doing is they're allowing

310
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,800
orders to build above and below to

311
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,980
intraday height is being formed between

312
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,800
the Asian range open and the Asian Range

313
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,680
close at midnight so we're looking for

314
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,560
that building up of orders we don't need

315
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,940
to know what the orders are how much

316
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,959
they are because we're never going to

317
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,000
know what that is but we can see it

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,279
indicated in how they maintain a very

319
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,440
narrow price range through Central Bank

320
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,540
dealers range time window and the Asian

321
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,600
range again if it's not clear if it's

322
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,540
not obvious in a small tight range

323
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,519
it's probably going to be an ugly London

324
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,139
session and you're not going to see a

325
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,639
clear manipulation cycle or

326
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,480
protractionary state

327
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
if the market is trending from 8 PM New

328
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,380
York

329
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,720
generally this is going to create London

330
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,139
sloppiness that means the move is most

331
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,120
likely occurred at the beginning of zero

332
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,200
GMT

333
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,480
8 PM NewYork time and it's going to

334
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,899
keep on rolling through until we see the

335
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,100
NewYork session

336
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
so again we don't want to see an Asian

337
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
session trending environment for an

338
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,579
ideal London entry

339
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,620
when the market is conditioned for

340
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,600
London slop as we just described in the

341
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,920
previous point

342
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,139
sleep in trade NewYork

343
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,420
that means if any of these things that

344
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,180
we've mentioned so far are there that

345
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,800
means that the London session is going

346
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,880
to be sloppy

347
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,380
if it's going to be sloppy does that

348
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,079
mean it's a high probability condition

349
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,600
absolutely not we want it to be so

350
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,380
slanted in our favor and that means not

351
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,700
trading every day

352
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
every single trading day will not have

353
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,339
the recipe for a clear profile as we

354
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,740
described in lesson five

355
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,839
but when we see these characteristics

356
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
here it lends very well for us to weigh

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,339
whether or not we're going to be

358
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,560
participating in London or if we do

359
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
participate in London and we just second

360
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,980
guess it and we have to see it for

361
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,480
ourselves by experience

362
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,060
trade with very very very little risk

363
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,380
because you're probably going to regret

364
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,860
knowing it

365
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
accumulation manipulation and

366
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,959
distribution is the business of intraday

367
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,620
trading that's all it is intraday is the

368
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,260
short-term Horizon where Banks can

369
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,160
manipulate and knock people out push in

370
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
orders

371
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,300
you know facilitate  false sentiment

372
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,260
ideas

373
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
so what we're looking for is these

374
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,540
orders to accumulate in the marketplace

375
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,000
we don't necessarily know how many

376
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,279
orders are above and below these

377
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,139
consolidations that we look for in the

378
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,399
CentralBankDealersRange in agent

379
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,920
range but we know based on our

380
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,660
DirectionalBias from the daily chart in

381
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,600
four hour with using the pdra Matrix and

382
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
if the data ranges where price will most

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,480
likely draw to on the HTFs

384
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,180
so if we know that and we're bullish we

385
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,560
can anticipate the next stage which is

386
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,000
manipulation

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,060
taking the price lower down into an area

388
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,660
where Traders will be induced to sell or

389
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,180
get knocked out of premature entries

390
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,339
that are already long they're going to

391
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,800
unseat those positions then they

392
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,779
distribute those positions they've

393
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,060
accumulated going long near the low of

394
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,160
the day near the high today at London

395
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,220
close or late NewYork

396
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,959
that's the model we're trading off of

397
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,579
that's we're looking for so if we don't

398
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,180
have clues or fingerprints if you will

399
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,480
to lend to these ideas being in price

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,000
it's not ambiguous it's not a guessing

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,740
game it's not well I wonder if it's

402
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,699
going to do this or what if it's going

403
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,860
to do that no we know exactly what we're

404
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,639
looking for there's Hallmark trademark

405
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,860
characteristics that make these London

406
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,220
session entries perfect and ideal and

407
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,260
it's based on the criteria we've given

408
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,120
you from the CentralBankDealersRange

409
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,100
and the Asian range

410
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,560
there are specific things that you look

411
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,040
for if they're not present you do not

412
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
have high probability conditions to

413
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,800
trade in

414
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,620
if they are as we were describing here

415
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,320
and you take the trade and you take a

416
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,000
supposed bullish order block or a

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,300
supposed turtle soup or something okay

418
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,160
and you lose money

419
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,800
now you know why because you don't have

420
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
IPDA in your favor where they're clearly

421
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
going to draw a price One Direction or

422
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
the other based on the criteria we've

423
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
given you in lesson five

424
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,060
if the conditions were selling you here

425
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,980
in lesson six are there

426
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,160
you have a great deal of odds in your

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,139
favor of losing money

428
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,000
so pay attention to these points because

429
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,579
it will keep you

430
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,860
at least in my opinion it's kept me from

431
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,019
doing a lot of trading where I was

432
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,880
that are off sitting

433
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
on the sidelines than there of getting

434
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,500
in their Marketplace if you look at 

435
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,820
some of the conditions that we've

436
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,559
outlined over the course of this

437
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,520
mentorship some of the days are ideal

438
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,559
for these events right here

439
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,199
then other days there are

440
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,900
instances where they're not so prevalent

441
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,419
and the conditions were probably in our

442
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,640
favor to trade but you still can be

443
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,419
wrong

444
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,319
so again this helps you avoid the ugly

445
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,359
periods but you're still going to get

446
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,940
these once in a while moves where it

447
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,200
would have been better had you taken a

448
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
trade

449
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,280
and all this is doing is help you know

450
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
when the odds are less in your favor and

451
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,919
believe me if you avoid this lesson if

452
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,900
you discount it if you think well you

453
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
know I'm just going to look for the

454
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,260
signals you're going to look for the

455
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,720
signals in this kind of mess and you're

456
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,980
not going to see the results you're

457
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,720
hoping for and you're going to attribute

458
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,360
to the stuff doesn't work ICT doesn't

459
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,640
have an edge there's no benefit to

460
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,840
knowing these types of things and it's

461
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
all fluff wrong you've seen enough

462
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,220
instances where Precision is there the

463
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,900
Precision won't come into the

464
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,059
marketplace or be evident in price

465
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,080
action when these elements are present

466
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
so I know what you're probably saying

467
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,700
what's going on in the marketplace when

468
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,960
these events are happening what are the

469
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,220
central banks doing

470
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,960
ready for this

471
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,539
I don't know

472
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:22,919
I don't know

473
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,160
and if I don't know or have a belief in

474
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
what they're doing

475
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,580
then that's certainly not a time where I

476
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,260
want to put money at risk and neither

477
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,000
should it be for you

478
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,520
we know what they're doing or most

479
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,080
likely doing

480
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
when we have these narrow consolidation

481
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,500
ranges between central bank dealers

482
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,299
range and Asian range when we have a

483
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,039
daily bias when we know where the draw

484
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,380
is on a daily chart where is the price

485
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,360
going to be drawn to what is it going to

486
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
be moving up to a premium or is it going

487
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,960
to be moving down to a discount

488
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,419
we knew that for a DirectionalBias

489
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,460
having that

490
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,820
applying it to our London session if we

491
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,500
can find the Standard normal protraction

492
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,200
profile or the delayed profile

493
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,660
in that direction of the day

494
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,840
we got it linked but you still can have

495
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
losses

496
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,260
if we see these conditions here

497
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,880
regardless of what we have as a daily

498
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,059
bias whatever we think it is doing it

499
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,220
doesn't matter all those things fall

500
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,600
second

501
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,820
to this criteria here because we're

502
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,440
specifically dealing with intraday

503
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,520
action

504
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,400
we have to have rule-based ideas we have

505
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
to have filters these are our filters

506
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,700
you do not trade every single trading

507
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,840
day

508
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,220
these

509
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,559
conditions will prevent you from taking

510
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,419
positions in London

511
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,700
and you have to accept it you got to

512
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,740
submit to it you have to be subordinate

513
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,020
to some level rules if you don't have

514
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,700
them you're going to over trade you're

515
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
going to trade every single day and yes

516
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,000
you might catch some amazing moves that

517
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,039
may appear when these conditions are

518
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,480
there and you'll be able to show me an

519
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,820
email I didn't do that and I still I

520
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,980
made 120 Pips here Michael look at this

521
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,780
and I'm gonna say you didn't follow the

522
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,880
rules you're gonna get mad you're gonna

523
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,679
be offended but I'm telling you up front

524
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,080
if it looks like this and you traded in

525
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,820
London you make money

526
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,200
I don't want to know about it because

527
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,940
all you're doing is just saying you did

528
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,780
not follow the rules

529
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,720
okay when is London open Killzone ideal

530
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,179
and we obviously we've talked about what

531
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,880
makes the avoidance of London session

532
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,500
most apt to be the best choice but what

533
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,520
do we do

534
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,160
to help formulate an ideal scenario

535
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,419
going to London

536
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,799
well the daily chart is going to be

537
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,860
clearly respecting PD arrays so are we

538
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,940
in an environment where the Market's

539
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,580
clearly respecting a

540
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,980
obvious clear

541
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,620
um non-ambiguous PD arrays where the

542
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,840
market just clearly is going to a an

543
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,059
order block or it's closing in a gap and

544
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,260
it's responding as you would

545
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,900
realistically expect it to when we have

546
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,880
those in here and find a high odds

547
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,700
probability trade in my favor as a day

548
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,380
trade I'm just going to get in here and

549
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,780
you know get lucky and learn that's

550
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,700
gambling we don't do that

551
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
so we have to have a discernible

552
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,580
Direction in the marketplace on the

553
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,380
daily chart and it has to be respecting

554
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,020
a PD array Matrix in that way we know

555
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,000
what our daily bias is is it going to be

556
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,900
reaching higher it's going to be

557
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,580
reaching lower it's just that simple

558
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,780
now when the market is poised to trade

559
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
higher on the daily to a premium array

560
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,500
we're going to be looking for London

561
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Longs because they're going to be ideal

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,919
entry points because we know that on the

563
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,960
HTF daily it's respecting

564
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,440
The pdra Matrix and the most likely

565
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,760
outcome is it's going to be reaching for

566
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,500
a premium PD array

567
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,659
the range at which it is trading at

568
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,000
right now at market price to the next

569
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,679
premium PD array

570
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,419
that is going to be indicative of how

571
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,220
much we can anticipate for the next

572
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,740
price move higher it may not fulfill

573
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,380
that entirely in the day trade day that

574
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,240
you're trading that in other words it

575
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,039
won't fulfill that entire range in one

576
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,280
day it can take several days and that's

577
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,919
going to also facilitate the

578
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,500
um continuation of the next trading day

579
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,820
are you going to be trading in London as

580
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,799
well because he may have that ring still

581
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,780
to fulfill and if it's still there on

582
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,400
the daily chart to reach up into that

583
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,539
premium

584
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,940
you have still reins to work with and

585
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,340
you may end up getting another set up in

586
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,200
the following consecutive trading day in

587
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,480
London and do the very same thing he did

588
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
in the day before buying

589
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,500
when the market is poised to trade lower

590
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,780
on The Daily to a discount array London

591
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,340
shorts are ideal

592
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,020
same scenario just reversed in the

593
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,240
previous point if we have just recently

594
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,980
traded off of a

595
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,440
premium array

596
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,940
and we're going to be reaching down into

597
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,500
a discount array that means a bullish

598
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,539
order block closing a fair value got the

599
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,340
below market price closing a liquidity

600
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,740
void below market price  trade down

601
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,900
below an old low Market deploys to make

602
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,419
a low resistance liquidity run to a

603
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,500
discount

604
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,960
if we see that scenario in the daily

605
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
London shorts are ideal it doesn't mean

606
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,900
circumvent all the previous slides that

607
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,880
I just mentioned those conditions have

608
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
to be eliminated in other words they

609
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,140
can't be present even in this condition

610
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,360
here in the previous Point as well

611
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,700
as it relates to premium arrays

612
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,039
either one of these conditions can be

613
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,559
canceled out if we've seen the

614
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,880
conditions that we just shown in the

615
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,659
previous two slides

616
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,179
when the DailyRange has not recently

617
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,880
exceeded its five-day average daily

618
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,840
range

619
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,539
an expansion day is due to form

620
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,000
so in other words if you study average

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,220
DailyRange you can do several 

622
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,100
studies like this you can look at every

623
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,840
single day what's the expected average

624
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
DailyRange from a five-day basis

625
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,059
and what is the actual five-day average

626
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,640
DailyRange at the close of the day

627
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,799
and keep a running log of that of the

628
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,600
pairs that you trade this is the reason

629
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,620
why you don't want to be trading 20

630
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,679
pairs because you can get really tuned

631
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
in to your payer or pairs if it's just

632
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,000
two by doing these types of things

633
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
because when the average DailyRange of

634
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,740
the last five days is factored not every

635
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,419
single day will the average DailyRange

636
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,179
be met many times it'll be

637
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,880
just below it or not even much more than

638
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,260
half the average DailyRange if we're in

639
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,960
a quiet period but if we have traded

640
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,900
several days and the previous day has

641
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,480
not seen or exceeded it doesn't mean it

642
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,799
has to go two times the average daily

643
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,260
range of a five-day basis but it has yet

644
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,940
to trade above the average DailyRange

645
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,280
on a five-day basis the previous day and

646
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,440
you're bullish you have a really good

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,539
chance of having a large range day the

648
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,419
day of your trade and we don't have the

649
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,799
commissions in the previous two slides

650
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,600
that will cancel out woman

651
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
if we have all those things present and

652
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
we can see the profile unfolding that we

653
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,020
learned in lesson five

654
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,320
you have the highest probability of a

655
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,080
big expansion day because the five-day

656
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,820
average DailyRange has not been traded

657
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,320
to or exceeded

658
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,419
in the previous day so we have a

659
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,600
condition of volatility it's low

660
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,840
and the average DailyRange many times

661
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,120
will be either one and a half or maybe

662
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,039
even two times the five day average

663
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,840
DailyRange in instances where we can

664
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,539
get a big range day you don't need very

665
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,039
many of those over the course of a month

666
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,659
to erase a lot of the screw-ups that

667
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,220
you'll make if you try to trade every

668
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,480
single day

669
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,520
you don't want to take your big winning

670
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,700
day and use that to remove all the

671
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,159
stupid trading days in order avoiding

672
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,960
the previous two slides conditions and

673
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,279
still trying to force a trade and trying

674
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,440
to show you know the community and

675
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,779
mentorship or show the internet that

676
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,460
you're you know you're smart or you

677
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,919
outdone what was necessarily  the ICT

678
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,440
rules you were able to find a setup

679
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,320
don't do that okay you're not going to

680
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
impress anyone you're not going to

681
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,020
impress me and it may not be important

682
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,600
to you but I can tell you if you stick

683
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,919
with these rules you're going to do

684
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,500
better than if you don't

685
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
but know that when we have these big

686
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,880
range days

687
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,820
we that's that's the cream

688
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,400
that's the that's the bonus for the

689
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,679
month okay when we catch these big range

690
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,059
days

691
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,919
you don't want to be trading every

692
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,659
single day because you're going to get

693
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,880
small little singles

694
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,340
draw down days draw down days draw down

695
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,740
days and then when you get a good win it

696
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,480
doesn't really show as a win because you

697
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,700
have all these small little singles

698
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,340
small little singles that erased by a

699
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,860
loss a loss a loss so you're treading

700
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,600
water and then all of a sudden you have

701
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,360
a normal trading win and it won't

702
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,740
register that much in terms of your

703
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,120
Equity growth

704
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,159
it will require you to use the big rain

705
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,200
stays to show all your profit and if you

706
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,760
look at a 20-day

707
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,919
study of every train every trading month

708
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,679
if you trade it every single day you're

709
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,240
going to see that your results are

710
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,940
skewed in such a way that if you're

711
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,460
profitable if you take out your largest

712
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,080
profitable day you probably aren't

713
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,460
making money

714
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,200
you don't want conditions like that in

715
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,320
your Equity growth okay you want to show

716
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,520
a smooth Equity growth line by ferreting

717
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,559
out the times when you don't want to be

718
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,059
trading because if you can take the

719
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,120
periods of drawdown probability out of

720
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,620
the equation or at least do your best to

721
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,700
remove it

722
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,320
then you stand a better chance of

723
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,779
trading when it's in ideal scenarios so

724
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,360
you really slant yourself to high

725
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,700
probability conditions so while you

726
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,140
still may suffer losses and you still

727
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,340
absolutely will

728
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,919
the larger losses will hopefully be

729
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,500
avoided because you're forcing yourself

730
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,200
in a role-based idea that way you'll

731
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,140
have singles singles doubles

732
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,760
three to one wins and then when you get

733
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,880
these really big huge Runners and you're

734
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,200
able to position yourself in London and

735
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,320
you let them go that will push your

736
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,380
Equity return for the month way over

737
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,720
your average you know if your average is

738
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,460
like eight to ten percent for the month

739
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,580
you catch a big average DailyRange big

740
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,200
move and you hold on to it for the whole

741
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
day many times that'll push you 10 15

742
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
more for the month than your normal

743
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,260
return

744
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,580
and

745
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,679
there's a way of standardizing your

746
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,760
monthly return

747
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,559
but you have to start with these

748
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,080
rule-based ideas so

749
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,539
as we learn more things we are we start

750
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,640
applying them to our live sessions we

751
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,400
start applying them to our

752
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,020
exercises and drills and

753
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,240
when we practice so when we have these

754
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,940
things we go through a specific criteria

755
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,240
a list of rules and eliminate certain

756
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,580
trading days and you'll know why we're

757
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,679
not trading those days versus if I say

758
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm not trading today and you're you're

759
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,400
less scratching your head saying why is

760
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,080
he not trading today what makes this day

761
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,640
any different from the other now you're

762
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
going to know so if I say I'm not

763
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,059
trading today you'll know why I'm not

764
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,440
trading it and you won't get upset you

765
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,940
won't be offended you won't think I'm

766
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,260
trying to go to the beach the next

767
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,760
morning and I'm just trying to get some

768
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,620
sleep you'll know why there's a real

769
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,919
reason why and it's consistent

770
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,500
it's not something that takes a great

771
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,140
deal of you know mental acrobatics to

772
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,760
understand these are very simple things

773
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
to understand when you look at the price

774
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
study it go back and look at several

775
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,100
months of data

776
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,140
I don't care what pair you look at if

777
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,840
you see these things in the marketplace

778
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,820
it's highly unlikely they're going to

779
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,980
get a clean London session and that's

780
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,779
what we want we want to trade when the

781
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,620
market has a clear squeeze on volatility

782
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,539
they're holding in the consolidation and

783
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,340
they're letting the order stack up we

784
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,659
know where the Market's going to want to

785
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,580
go on a daily chart how many times have

786
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,260
you seen over the course of the last six

787
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,480
seven months where I'm calling the

788
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,760
market on the daily chart it's almost 98

789
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,419
accurate it's ridiculous okay so when we

790
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,020
apply these ideas and we fare it out all

791
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,059
the times when the conditions we showed

792
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,799
in the two previous slides are there

793
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,600
we're going to miss some moves and

794
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
that's fine we don't care about that but

795
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
we're leaning ourselves heavily in the

796
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,360
basically the salad days the easy

797
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,419
trading days okay and we're moving now

798
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,580
into a framework where I actually trade

799
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,860
with these types of things so I don't

800
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,480
trade every single day and there's gonna

801
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,860
be times now going forward in our

802
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,899
mentorship when we have these conditions

803
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,299
there I'll let you know in the Forum

804
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:24,059
this is not a high probability day we

805
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,559
will be sitting on the sidelines waiting

806
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,659
for new events or waiting for the New

807
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,559
York session

808
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,500
so now you have a clear reason why

809
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,960
I won't be taking certain participation

810
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,559
in in trading days and you'll know what

811
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,580
you're going to be learning from not

812
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,740
doing it and we'll see many instances

813
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,740
where it will protect us from taking

814
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,200
what would otherwise be a losing trade

815
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,460
in London

816
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
so hopefully you found this lesson

817
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,419
insightful I know it's not exciting it's

818
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,860
not sexy it doesn't have all kinds of

819
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,500
charts but it's one of those ones that

820
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,159
require you to think it's one of those

821
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,080
why 

822
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,419
it's one of those lessons that helps you

823
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,460
build a Winner's mindset you have to

824
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,360
have

825
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,480
rules you have to and the best rules are

826
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,799
the ones that help you stay out of the

827
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,600
marketplace because everybody can get in

828
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,880
the marketplace there's no there's no

829
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,520
shortage on reasons to get into a trade

830
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
because everybody can come up with one

831
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,700
they make books about it all day long

832
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,220
every bookshelf in the bookstores have

833
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,539
some reason why you need to be a buyer

834
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,220
or seller based on something

835
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,940
but very little is written about how do

836
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,200
you know when to stay out of the

837
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,159
marketplace

838
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,380
that's what this lesson has given you

839
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,960
so here's one of the beautiful elements

840
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,700
to it

841
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,799
I don't care if you're a position Trader

842
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,760
at heart

843
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,740
a swing Trader at heart

844
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,080
I don't care if you're a One-Shot one

845
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,700
kill Trader

846
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,620
I don't care if you're just gonna be a

847
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,000
day trader or if you're going to be a

848
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,320
scalper like we're going to learn next

849
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,940
month

850
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,880
the criteria I just gave you here will

851
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,760
save your backside regardless of what

852
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
trading discipline you have

853
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,179
because if you're going to be executing

854
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,100
and trying to trade with the London

855
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,120
session

856
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,600
as your means of Entry if it looks like

857
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
these two previous slides you want to

858
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,940
wait just wait until a better technical

859
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,460
picture and when you get it you'll have

860
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,960
no problem taking your entry and you'll

861
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
be much more

862
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,960
fortified in knowing that you have the

863
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,399
all the odds that you could possibly

864
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,059
have reasonably you know in your favor

865
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,380
and that's where you want to live as a

866
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,059
Trader you want to be in the market when

867
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,940
it's highly favored on your side of the

868
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,679
marketplace you want to be on side not

869
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,820
offside

870
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,340
and the way I've learned over a long

871
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,140
period and these are lessons that I had

872
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,299
to learn painfully very painfully

873
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,240
because I'm stubborn I want to do things

874
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,340
the way I want to do things and if

875
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,720
someone tells me I shouldn't do this I'm

876
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,820
going in doing that very thing you know

877
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,100
what it's like the sign says on the lawn

878
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,140
don't step on the grass I'm doing The

879
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,520
Jig on it I'm dancing all over it

880
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,899
moonwalking on it not because I'm

881
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,940
ignorant I'm trying to be rude it's just

882
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,100
that's my nature it's human nature to do

883
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,120
the very things you know you're not

884
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,580
supposed to do so you have to have these

885
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,500
rule-based ideas so that's why there's

886
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,960
no charts in this there's no let me show

887
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,419
you examples of this okay it's rules

888
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,019
it's 100 rules and I'm going to leave it

889
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,720
up to you to have this created as a

890
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,039
checklist

891
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,779
I'm not going to give you a checklist

892
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,279
that has this stuff because I want you

893
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,440
to write it in your own handwriting once

894
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
you write it out subconsciously you're

895
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,220
going to retain that and then every day

896
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,840
you're going to refer to it when you

897
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,640
look at the marketplace and in the

898
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,620
previous two slides if those conditions

899
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,720
are there you already know probability

900
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,580
has fallen off the table and it's not

901
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,740
likely to be a easy trading session for

902
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,760
London

903
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,380
now think about that

904
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,200
very very empowering

905
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
it also gives you context

906
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,399
yet you might still be bullish on that

907
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,120
pair

908
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,940
you might be bearish on that pair

909
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,340
but when you don't have the conditions

910
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,539
in favor for technical symmetry

911
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,279
where you can expect and clearly

912
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,440
anticipate the manipulation on the

913
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,780
central banks when they reprice higher

914
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,699
and go in a perfectionary state we're

915
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,320
entering in that

916
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,879
if we don't have the framework to

917
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,440
clearly see when they're going to do

918
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,339
that

919
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,899
what are we doing in the marketplace

920
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,280
then

921
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,339
what everybody else does Gamble and

922
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,440
gamblers sometimes make money

923
