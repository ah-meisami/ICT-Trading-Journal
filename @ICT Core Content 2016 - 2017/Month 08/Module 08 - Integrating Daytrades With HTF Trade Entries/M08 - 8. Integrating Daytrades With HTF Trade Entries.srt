1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,599
hey folks welcome back to lesson eight

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,139
the final of April 2017's content for

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,240
ICT day trading model

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,440
this lesson is going to be teaching

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
integrating day trades with higher time

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,859
frame trade entries

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,539
okay folks we're gonna be revisiting

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,119
Power3

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,679
and we'll be talking specifically with

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,480
day trade entries and hard time frame

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,899
setups

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,280
now we can use day trading entries to

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,500
position ourselves in our longer term

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000
HTF trades

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,860
and a method that employs very little

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
time and Analysis

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,579
we do not need to use the London Kill

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,980
Zone if you're not able to trade it some

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
of you aren't able to get up aren't able

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,719
to stay awake can't do it because a

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,180
business family work I get it trust me

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,620
I've been there

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,500
we don't need that to London killZone

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
to be a day trader you don't need to

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,659
learn the Killzone to be entering with

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,479
your hard time frame setups as a day

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,939
trader either there's a way of using day

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,920
trading Concepts to facilitate an entry

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,780
on a longer term HTF sets

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,860
there are two essential times of the day

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,299
IPDA refers to reset

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,659
the daily candle can point the ideal

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,320
entries for all styles of trade

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,640
and when we look at a daily candle

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,320
obviously I've taught this in the past

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,740
Power3 refers to the open

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,700
the rally or decline and then close

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,979
obviously for an up close day or bullish

39
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,020
day we would see the open near the low

40
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,479
of the day a small little Wick below the

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,420
opening price an expansion move or range

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,799
expansion

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,979
up then a close that typically closes

44
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,500
just a little bit off the high today

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,960
for a down close or a bearish day we see

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,180
the open near the HOD with a

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
very small little Wick above the opening

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
price then an expansion move lower

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,500
with the clothes coming off the low with

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,879
a small little Wick making the low of

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,640
the day in respect to the close

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,879
that's Power3 it's the open rally

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,739
up close or open decline down close

54
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,200
the open is near one extreme of the

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
DailyRange and the close is near one

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,540
end of the DailyRange

57
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,700
so they're going to be opposite extremes

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,500
now obviously it goes without saying

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
typically you know we've mentioned this

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,720
in many times before in the free stuff

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,700
but there is

62
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,940
a vacuum of concern when we look at

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,379
Price action like this as a retail

64
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,840
Trader we're not even aware these

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
phenomenons have any significance

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
so when we look at price on a daily

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,420
chart

68
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,640
okay I just think from a say for

69
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,220
instance that you are not

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,400
able to  have any difficulty getting

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,560
up in London okay just imagine for a

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,519
moment if you did how could you enter as

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,000
a day trader or how could you day trade

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,459
and you have to avoid the London session

75
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,739
that was one of the

76
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,140
things I had to come up with to fill in

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,480
the  the void where there was a short

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,819
period in time where I could not do

79
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,920
anything in London I had to help take

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,440
care of the kids my wife was just unable

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,800
to do anything she was  nursing and

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
healing up from having a child

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,140
I wanted to trade but I couldn't do it

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,120
because I had to take care of three kids

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,640
and one of them being a newborn so I had

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,340
to really figure out a way to overcome

87
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,400
that and this was my answer or my

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,659
solution to it now obviously there's

89
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,640
this isn't the last and be all end-all

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,959
but for me it worked

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,220
okay the open or openings

92
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,140
now there's two session openings that I

93
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,659
monitored daily it's the zero GMT this

94
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,780
is your Standard platform on Forex LTD

95
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,640
demo you see me teaching with in my

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,760
tutorials you can use that time for

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,120
calibration wherever you are globally

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,918
and then obviously everyone knows about

99
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,260
the midnight NewYork time that opening

100
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,500
price as it relates to NewYork time

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,620
whatever that time is on your platform

102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,080
that opening price on an hourly chart

103
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,540
that's what we're looking for

104
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,880
well this teaching

105
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,500
okay we're gonna go a little bit beyond

106
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,699
that

107
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,820
and there are very refined entry points

108
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,680
that can be had in London open obviously

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,440
that goes without saying

110
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,860
but here's the here's the Rub With It

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,900
you don't need it

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,880
if you understand the DailyRange and

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,220
you understand what IPDA is going to do

114
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,259
or most likely to do let's say it that

115
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,540
way and you understand where you're at

116
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,699
in the PD array Matrix where are we

117
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,139
moving from

118
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,600
are we moving from a discount up into a

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,340
premium are we moving from a premium

120
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,259
down into a discount

121
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,300
knowing that gives us DirectionalBias

122
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,180
it gives us an understanding of what we

123
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
should be looking for being a buyer or

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,759
seller

125
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,740
and

126
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,500
it's not required to position day

127
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,419
trading Concepts on

128
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,580
HTF setups by using the

129
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,740
London open you're not limited to that

130
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,960
there's other ways of doing it

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
so I want you to think for a second

132
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,500
imagine being able to trade to daily

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,380
range for a single day or hold for a

134
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,600
much longer duration of trade harvesting

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
a larger number of Pips how could you do

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,940
that

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
well we're gonna be looking at IPDA true

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,020
day open and this is reset

139
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,360
the daily candle

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,580
um at zero GMT

141
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,199
that's our beginning reference point for

142
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,539
IPDA that's treaty opening but then

143
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,880
there's true day as I refer to it when

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm trading London using the midnight

145
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,840
candle in NewYork that's my opening

146
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
price there

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,620
because I'm able to be awake and I'm

148
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,900
able to trade London and I'm wanting to

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,280
be there because I want to be able to

150
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,160
capture that really small tiny little

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,979
move of protraction up on down days or

152
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,919
down moves right before the up close I

153
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,419
want to be able to capture that little

154
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,419
movement or at least get in there and

155
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,280
fade that move so that way I can have a

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,860
very tight Ultra small stop in

157
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,900
relationship to what I may be doing on a

158
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,460
HTF setup

159
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,380
but when we look at the Power3 what

160
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,240
we're really doing is we're looking at

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,400
the opening price and we're waiting for

162
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,419
the opposite to occur in the DailyRange

163
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,160
when we're bullish we're going to be

164
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
buying near the LOD or near

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,900
the opening

166
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,240
the main question is

167
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,180
how much lower from the opening will it

168
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,900
go

169
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,360
if it's going to be an up close

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,919
and if it's going to be a down close how

171
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,080
much higher than the opening will it go

172
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,180
before it makes a lower close

173
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,300
I get this question so many times and

174
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,280
I'm just going to tell you this

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,759
it's been staring at you all this time

176
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,520
it's been in your charts every day and

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,740
you don't pay any attention to it

178
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,800
I have also LED everybody away from this

179
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
because it's just one of those things I

180
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,940
wasn't willing to share but because

181
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,500
you're in the mentorship you get to

182
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,599
learn it

183
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,539
this little hyphenated little Dash that

184
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,000
appears on all the daily candles

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,520
or not candles but open high low close

186
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,280
bar if you set that for your platform

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
that little opening hashtag tick to the

188
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,620
left of your  daily candles or bars

189
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,080
that opening

190
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,479
is all you need to know

191
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,340
that occurs

192
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,340
very very early in the evening in New

193
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,560
York time so I'm on the East Coast I'm

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
basically the same time as in NewYork

195
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,560
residing in Maryland I have East Coast

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,860
time

197
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
wherever that is in terms of zero GMT

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,340
using the Forex LTD platform the demo

199
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,620
you need to calibrate your local time

200
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,300
and know what that time is where you

201
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,259
live

202
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,300
all you need to know is that opening

203
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,199
price

204
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,940
that's it

205
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,960
what we're going to do with that

206
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,479
information is frame it in such a way

207
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,520
where we can use it knowing when we're

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,580
going to be buying or selling

209
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm going to up close we're trying to

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,719
capture that big lines portion move up

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,458
and when it's down close we're trying to

212
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,620
capture that big

213
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,860
range going lower for a day trade but

214
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,440
this is the same concept we'll use this

215
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,140
in the same vein by trading with higher

216
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,959
time frame setups the key is you have to

217
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,060
know where you're at on the hard time

218
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,640
frame pdra Matrix

219
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,500
obviously if we're looking for up close

220
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,880
we need to be seeing the daily moving

221
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,060
away from a discount array

222
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,279
it has to have already respected a

223
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,320
discount array so that way the next

224
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
trading day we should see no movement at

225
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,380
all if very little below the opening

226
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,260
price at zero GMT

227
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,680
if we are looking at a bear scenario

228
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,480
on the daily chart we have to have

229
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
recently traded at a premium array and

230
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,880
price has to have shown a respect of

231
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,620
that in other words it's repelled or

232
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,260
failed to go higher the next trading day

233
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,480
at zero GMT

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,980
we're gonna be using that opening price

235
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,180
to facilitate trade

236
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,680
so let's assume for a moment we have

237
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,200
watched our daily chart trade down into

238
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,660
a discount PD array

239
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,420
and we're expecting bullish prices now

240
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,100
institutional order flow has been

241
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
bullish we've come down into a level

242
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,660
that would be expected to be bullish on

243
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,120
a daily time frame we've hit a bullish

244
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,220
order block and price has shown a

245
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,019
willingness to Rally away from that the

246
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,779
very next day at zero GMT we're going to

247
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,459
look at that opening price now I've

248
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,620
trained and conditioned all of you to

249
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,940
look for that opening price and then

250
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,740
expect that down move

251
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,860
that's your classic London setup

252
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,680
but what if you can't be up during that

253
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,820
time

254
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,220
the London protraction you may not be

255
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,440
able to be able to see it you can't be

256
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,180
there to watch it you can't participate

257
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,500
if you will

258
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,260
well is that entirely true

259
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,080
not necessarily just because you're not

260
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,580
awake doesn't mean you can't take

261
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,200
advantage of it

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
what we look for is yes the opening

263
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,779
price but we have already arrived at

264
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,420
what if we were awake at London we would

265
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,060
expect that move down anyway

266
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,680
that's what we're looking for that Judas

267
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,180
swing that protractionary state in the

268
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,880
market where price goes lower to seek

269
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,420
liquidity to make a move higher with an

270
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,820
up close

271
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,000
all we need to know is Are we more

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,980
likely to go higher or more more likely

273
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,260
to go lower so if we set our daily bias

274
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,959
based on the daily

275
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,920
PD arrays and if the data ranges and the

276
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
quarterly shift is still bullish

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
everything that's significantly pointed

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,399
higher if we're in a seasonal tendency

279
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,920
for bullish prices if it's a Monday

280
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,220
Tuesday or Wednesday it's a loaded deal

281
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,560
the main thing is we have to see price

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,540
having already respected a daily

283
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,000
discount PD array

284
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,820
you have to see it do that and then the

285
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,560
very next trading day you're looking at

286
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,940
zero GMT

287
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,440
opening price

288
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,019
so that means that in local time in

289
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,320
America that's pretty easy regardless of

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
where you're at in the North American

291
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,740
continent real real easy to get that

292
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,060
price

293
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,500
where you're at in the world where it

294
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,200
makes it difficult for you I can't

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,820
answer for that so you'll have to work

296
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,260
in the London session

297
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,459
but

298
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,200
for those individuals that want to trade

299
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,920
Asia but have the effects of London open

300
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,000
this is how you do it

301
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,140
we don't know how much of a

302
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,579
projectionary state there's going to be

303
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,620
not always but we can have a reasonable

304
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,120
expectation

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,820
so why zero Jam T well you already have

306
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,100
CentralBankDealersRange closing right

307
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,240
now

308
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,459
at zerojmt you know what the Central

309
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,140
Bank dealers range is most likely going

310
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,459
to provide you in terms of Standard

311
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,980
Deviation

312
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,180
but what if you don't want to use

313
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,519
CentralBankDealersRange why you would

314
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,200
think that I don't know but does it say

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,839
you don't even want to consider it

316
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,720
I think it's Advantage  to knowing it

317
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
so you can expect how much of a

318
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
projectionary phase and  price will go

319
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
higher or lower in this case going lower

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,160
below the opening price for a bullish up

321
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,620
close during London

322
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
but what we're going to be doing is

323
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,360
focusing primarily on being a buyer at

324
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,579
zero GMT

325
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,620
wait a minute I'm just going to buy it

326
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,200
at zero GMT yeah you're just gonna buy

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
it at zero GMT

328
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,639
you're going to use a five day average

329
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,500
DailyRange

330
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,120
as you stop

331
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,980
whoa Michael wait a minute what you're

332
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,019
saying is

333
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,420
this could potentially be a

334
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,639
90 pip stop

335
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,160
what if it's a hundred pip stop

336
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
then that's what it is

337
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,820
remember we're not day trading with

338
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,680
minute risk trying to capture 20R okay

339
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,139
we're not trying to do that here this

340
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,480
topic and teaching is how to integrate

341
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,240
day trading and Concepts to get into

342
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,300
your hard time frame trade entries

343
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,860
since you're looking for higher time

344
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,240
frame setups

345
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,940
but 90 to 100 pip stop is relatively

346
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,680
insignificant because you're looking for

347
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,940
moves that are going to be paying

348
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,040
several hundred Pips or you should be

349
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,959
that's what you should be looking for

350
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,820
those types of moves so if you want to

351
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,339
frame those ideas and use day trading

352
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,459
Concepts you would be buying at zero GMT

353
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,200
using a five day average DailyRange as

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,300
your stop loss you would take whatever

355
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,459
the average DailyRange is subtract it

356
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,320
from the opening price at zero GMT

357
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,480
there's your stop loss and you just let

358
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,220
it rip you just trade it accordingly

359
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,839
based on your HTFs until

360
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,440
it trades to a premium PD array

361
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,139
now what if you want to use this concept

362
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,139
as a day trade you just want to do it as

363
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,899
a single one day event you think it's

364
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,519
going to be a big range everything's

365
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,399
pointing to a larger update close and

366
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,740
it's been small ranges recently and we

367
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,720
respected a discount PD array on the

368
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,760
daily chart it's institutional overflow

369
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,380
has been bullish anyway it's quarterly

370
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,360
effect is underway and it's still

371
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
bullish

372
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,899
everything is expected to go higher it's

373
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,279
a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday

374
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
what can we do with that in regards to

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,600
intraday

376
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,639
well you're going to take the same thing

377
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,839
and reverse it for cells

378
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,339
we don't know how much of a

379
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,860
projectionary state we will have without

380
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,440
being awake so

381
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,120
we don't need to know exactly how much

382
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
that is we can have Central Bank dealers

383
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,860
range hint at that but again we don't

384
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
know how much of that London

385
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,060
protractionary phase in price is going

386
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,079
to move up above that zero GMT

387
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,420
the key is we have already seen price

388
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,880
move away from a premium PD array on a

389
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,279
daily chart it has to have to happen the

390
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,040
day before the trade day so the previous

391
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
session we want to see price having

392
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,380
respected a premium PD array and it's

393
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,540
not wanting to Rally or obviously hit it

394
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,079
and start to sell off so we're near

395
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,740
the high end of the range

396
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,019
it's at a premium it's already shown a

397
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,240
willingness to respect some measure of a

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
premium PD array some bear shoulder

399
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,260
block or it's rejected an old high

400
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,420
Turtle suit the very next trading day

401
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,699
well zero GMT

402
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,519
on Forex ltd's demo platform you're

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,740
going to be looking to sell short

404
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,000
rate zero GMT

405
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,079
or you can sell it 0 GMT

406
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,880
plus 20 Pips

407
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,639
and again using the five day average

408
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,339
DailyRange I just stopped

409
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,560
what are we accomplishing here

410
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,620
well we can anticipate obviously a

411
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,540
little bit of movement or projectionary

412
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,459
phase in the marketplace where the Judas

413
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,199
swing occurs right before that down

414
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,459
close

415
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,880
adding 20 Pips to the zero GMT opening

416
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,139
price

417
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,199
that would be your sell limit order and

418
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,519
then adding the average five-day range

419
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,060
ADR to your limit entry so let's give an

420
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,459
example say it was  you were getting

421
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,600
it and at 1.50

422
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,199
and the average DailyRange is at

423
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,880
50. you would get in at

424
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,380
105.00 and your stock would be at 105.50

425
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,160
now that's a relatively small stop but

426
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,859
that would be an example so what you're

427
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,079
doing is you're protecting yourself

428
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,459
and

429
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,939
building in enough of a filter or or a

430
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,459
barrier if you will that the likelihood

431
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,439
of price rallying from the open at zero

432
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,380
GMT 70 Pips before going down with a

433
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,179
down close highly unlikely especially if

434
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,360
we've seen a previous day or yesterday

435
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
it trading from a premium PD array from

436
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
a daily chart

437
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,419
so long and short is

438
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,640
we already know there's going to be very

439
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,380
little upside about the opening price

440
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,360
because we are in a bearish cycle

441
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,820
so if that's the case we can just look

442
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,799
at the opening price at 20 Pips To it

443
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,840
there's your limit order your stop is

444
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,940
the five-day average DailyRange added

445
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,880
to that entry and then you use your 

446
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,460
hard time frame

447
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,340
objectives for your time of your profit

448
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,320
and you need to go to sleep just let it

449
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
go

450
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,260
now there's for me sometimes you might

451
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,320
have a 20 pip limit and it doesn't go up

452
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
20 Pips and just runs away

453
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,179
how can you accomplish  the same thing

454
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,580
and not be afraid of missing the move

455
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,120
well if you take your total position

456
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,620
okay and you divide it in half what was

457
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,840
your total lot size that you were going

458
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,179
to trade and or percentage risk that you

459
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,039
were going to trade at plus 20 Pips

460
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
above zero gmt's opening

461
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,500
take half of that risk and just simply

462
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,880
add it

463
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,400
at the zero GMT

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,039
there's your first portion put it in

465
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,620
there right away at zero GMT and then

466
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,020
you can do a second portion

467
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,419
at 20 Pips above the opening price it

468
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,460
may not fill you there but at least you

469
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,980
have something in so that way with a

470
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,240
five-day average DailyRange does it

471
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,340
should stop there you go you're

472
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,059
positioned

473
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,340
I'm going you could just sell at zero

474
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,080
GMT opening

475
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,539
and use the last five days average daily

476
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,760
range as your protective stop you can

477
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,840
take the Sell

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,580
at zero GMT

479
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,240
or add 10 to 20 Pips above the opening

480
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,620
price

481
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,240
for your Sell

482
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,039
so that way you're going to anticipate

483
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,799
some measure protractionary phase in

484
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
price in London

485
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,240
when price rallies up it might rally up

486
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,120
30 points it might rally up 40. it might

487
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,740
even rally 50.

488
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,380
but you already have several Pips above

489
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,419
the zero GMT opening price

490
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,120
to get you in as a limit to sell

491
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,220
then by having a five-day average daily

492
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,919
range above your entry you're building

493
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,400
in as much as 60 to 70 Pips

494
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,740
and again that's highly unlikely if

495
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,539
you're trading on the heels of the

496
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,480
previous day having respect of a daily

497
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,340
premium pdra

498
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,160
you can buy days simply buy at zero GMT

499
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
or

500
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,059
buy it with 10 to 20 Pips below the

501
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,980
opening price at zero GMT

502
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,600
there's your limit order of the buy so

503
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,679
that way you're going to catch some

504
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,120
Judas swing if it occurs

505
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,500
if it goes down a few Pips and fills you

506
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,539
and say it goes down 30 more the

507
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,919
likelihood of the five-day average daily

508
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,000
range

509
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,100
being subtracted from the opening price

510
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,020
is your GMT

511
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,200
and your 10 or 20 Pips below that

512
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
opening price as your entry again the

513
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
likelihood is 70 Pips 60 70 Pips going

514
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
down from the opening price just to have

515
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,220
it up close it doesn't usually happen if

516
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,320
price is already respected a daily

517
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
discount pdra now

518
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,660
you have homework

519
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,760
I want you to find three examples and

520
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,039
yes you have to do this go through your

521
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,059
charts and find in recent weeks where

522
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,980
you'll have three examples of this

523
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,799
concept in price action using only the

524
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,320
opening price at zero GMT when you're

525
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,240
bullish

526
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,179
or where price rallied up or using it as

527
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,860
the opening price and then a limit order

528
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,539
above or below relative to what you

529
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,160
think in terms of the the close if it's

530
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,140
going to be bullish or expected to see

531
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,419
bullish prices based on the analysis

532
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:22,740
that you would see around that time

533
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,760
obviously you have the benefit of the

534
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,500
hindsight but this is how you learn it

535
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,179
you look for it in price and you show

536
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,340
you show yourself many examples I can

537
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,400
give you 20 of them in this but it's not

538
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
as good as if you go through the price

539
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,940
action yourself I'm forcing you to go

540
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,659
through

541
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,600
the cycle of looking for PD arrays

542
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,179
the HTF looking at

543
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,039
institutional order flow and framing

544
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,940
that on clear cut discount or premium

545
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,380
arrays

546
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,299
when price is wanting to go higher

547
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,580
you'll see it obviously in hindsight but

548
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,140
I want you to focus on the Zero GMT

549
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,400
opening price

550
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,039
and how much that goes down relative to

551
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,039
the five-day average DailyRange

552
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,900
the

553
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,880
a five-day average DailyRange if you

554
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,299
don't have my ICT indicator

555
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,220
just about everybody has that but if you

556
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,960
don't have it

557
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,780
um you can use the simple indicators on

558
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,240
most of the platforms the ATR average

559
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,580
true range do it on a five day and

560
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,200
that'll give you your your your number

561
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,240
okay for each day it's going to get real

562
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,980
close to what the ICT average daily

563
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,120
range indicator is the only thing that

564
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,919
makes that one good is it gives you a

565
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,539
line when it hits it it turns blue it

566
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,280
gives the impression that you're you're

567
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,740
a lot more fancier than you really are

568
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,620
you don't need it but it's just  a way

569
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,640
of

570
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,500
building our stop loss we'll know what

571
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,120
our stop is based on whatever the

572
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,320
average DailyRange in the last five

573
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,880
days

574
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,039
doesn't mean you won't get stopped out

575
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,220
sometimes it doesn't mean that  the

576
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,799
market won't stop you out and still go

577
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
where you thought that still can happen

578
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
but this was what my solution was to not

579
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,179
being awake during London but still

580
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,740
looking for the setups based on what I

581
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,299
understood in price

582
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,860
so I look forward to seeing your example

583
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,840
shared on the Forum it'll be shared

584
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,000
hopefully by majority of you if not all

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,039
of you but three examples do it in one

586
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,659
post

587
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,059
what pair it was where it was how much

588
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,400
of a movement down or up from your

589
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,500
opening price relative to

590
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,419
um being a buyer seller

591
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,360
and I want you in these three examples I

592
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,000
want to see one that worked as a buy

593
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,700
one worked as a Sell and then one where

594
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,140
it did not work and I don't care if it

595
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,900
failed as a buy or so but find one of

596
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,700
each share that in your post on the

597
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,919
Forum in the April content thread

598
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,200
until next time I wish you good luck and

599
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,679
good Trading
