00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,799
welcome back folks this is Lesson Four

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,179
short-term Trading

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,420
blending Gupta data ranges and PD arrays

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,680
for liquidity runs

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,859
okay when we're looking at if the data

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,960
ranges

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,840
we're referring to specifically time

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,260
and PD arrays are dealing specifically

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,579
with price

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,520
so blending the two elements together

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
you're blending time and price

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,379
theoretically

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,379
if the data ranges provide you a context

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,879
to look back

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,579
the last 20 days the last 40 days in the

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,420
last 60 days

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,739
As you move forward

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,680
you're casting forward for a new set of

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
20 40 and 60 each new day you shift that

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,560
range forward

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,260
the look back period gives you the

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,000
context of frame

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,240
the PD arrays with a reference point in

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,479
time

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
the enter Bank price delivery algorithm

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
will reach back in to data arrays

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,500
between the last 20 days the last 40

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,780
days and the last 60 days

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,759
which

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,780
data array they use or refer to is

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,259
respective to the PD array in reference

32
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,060
to price

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,640
if price is in a premium Market

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,220
obviously working for the market price

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,299
up

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,799
we would be looking for a bearish

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,360
mitigation block

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,180
a bearish breaker

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,399
liquidity void

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,799
fair value Gap

41
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,320
a bearish order block

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,600
a rejection block

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,520
an old high or an old low

44
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,160
for the market price and below for a

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,419
discount Market

46
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,038
we would be looking for a bullish

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,660
mitigation block

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,319
a bullish breaker liquidity void

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,360
fair value Gap

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
bullish order block

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,959
rejection block

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,200
old low or old High

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,260
moving from the market price up in the

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
order that's listed in the premium data

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,400
arrays that's the

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
order in which the algorithm will seek

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,060
those respective price reference points

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,280
they're not in any different order this

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
is the order for the hierarchy in the

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,480
way that they're set up

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,620
there is not always a void or Gap or

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,260
mitigation block it may just simply need

63
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,180
to go all the way up to a bearish order

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,819
block or a rejection block and the same

65
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,160
thing is said in opposite terms for when

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,000
the Market's in a discount

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,660
it's not ambiguous when we look at price

68
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,220
in the form of the PD array Matrix

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,440
a good practice this is always to Simply

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,780
go through your price charts and just

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,940
look for where price is right now at the

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,459
market price and above you

73
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,099
okay looking back last

74
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,860
20 days and 40 days and 60 days

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,940
which PD arrays in the form of a premium

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,019
Market exist again not all of these

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,260
bearish or premium arrays will exist in

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,060
your price

79
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,700
there may be a selection of three or

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,060
four or maybe as little as two

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,000
rarely we have all of them

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
to choose from

83
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
so what you're doing is you're looking

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,060
back over the last 20 days

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,519
and you're looking to see above us in

86
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,799
terms of the market price what would be

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
deemed as a premium Market

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,440
the last 20 days which PD array exists

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,420
in price action

90
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,879
looking back 20 days

91
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,360
which discount PD array exists below us

92
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,940
there may be a PD array above and or

93
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,519
below us that's already been used by

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,740
Price action for instance you know maybe

95
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,419
a bullish order block

96
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,759
price is already traded down into and

97
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,280
responded and reacted accordingly and

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
had higher prices

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
that PD array has now been exhausted so

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,300
you'd have to look for another discount

101
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,199
PD array

102
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,600
when we refer to time and price what

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,880
we're doing is we're blending both the

104
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
components just like the algorithm does

105
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,460
the algorithm has to go back a specific

106
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,860
number of time

107
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,040
so what we do is we break it into 20

108
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
trading days which is essentially one

109
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,620
month

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,900
40 trading days which is essentially two

111
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,479
months and 60 trading days which is

112
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,979
essentially three trading months

113
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,460
by combining both time and price we get

114
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,500
the closest thing we can arrive at in

115
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,419
terms of what the algorithm will seek to

116
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,060
do in terms of trading to the next level

117
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,979
liquidity

118
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,620
when the markets are bearish

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,960
we work from a premium Market down to a

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
discount

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,220
based on whatever premium PD array

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,160
discount PD array exist in your current

123
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
market action

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
when it's bearish those premium PD

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,800
arrays will be your resistance points or

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,139
where cell signals or sell-offs will

127
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,039
occur

128
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,460
or new cell setups

129
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,979
the objective for price to reach down

130
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,880
into will be the discount PD arrays that

131
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,280
exist in your price action

132
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,860
we don't force the idea of any of these

133
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,240
PD arrays

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,759
they're either in the chart or they're

135
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,500
not

136
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,780
if there's an absence of any one of them

137
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,860
it doesn't negate or increase or lessen

138
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,340
the validity of a ideal setup

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,800
it just means that you have far less to

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
choose from in terms of targets

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,580
or setups

142
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,060
all right let's take a look at an

143
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,860
example we're going to use the

144
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,360
Australian dollar this is the daily

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,660
chart

146
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,199
and the first thing you want to do is

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,720
you want to break your market up in

148
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,039
reference to time

149
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,620
so now we have the look back of 20

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,000
trading days

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,120
40 trading days and 60 trading days

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,940
we can go back all the way to the 60

153
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,380
trading days

154
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,080
and you can see that the lowest point

155
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,539
with the old load noted

156
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,000
and the highest high formed in the last

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,120
20 trading days that is our total 60-day

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,199
trading range

159
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,060
splitting that market in half in

160
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,280
reference to its old High

161
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,560
and it's old low we can see where the

162
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,560
premium and discount Market ranges exist

163
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,620
if this old Woe Is violated

164
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,080
we would have to go back

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,500
and look at the old low

166
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,160
formed in the 60-day look back period

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,860
the arrow delineating the the lowest low

168
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,560
in the last 20 trading days if that is

169
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,020
violated and traded below

170
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,419
we would go back not to the 40 trading

171
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,120
days because there's no lower low

172
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,740
the next lower low or discount PD array

173
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,720
exists in the 60-day look back

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
and those levels are noted respectively

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
the last 40 trading days you can see the

176
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,819
range is defined by the highest high and

177
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,340
the lowest low in the last 20 trading

178
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,520
days

179
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,240
so when we look at the last 20 trading

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,800
days

181
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,199
what we do is we think in terms of the

182
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,539
PD array Matrix

183
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,819
now what I've done here is I've overlaid

184
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,620
the actual

185
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,000
Matrix

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,740
now you don't need to have this much

187
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,559
information or try to have this in your

188
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,020
price action but I'm giving you a

189
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,479
graphic depiction on how I internalize

190
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,299
and I interpret price action

191
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,240
so if we see where price is right now at

192
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,399
Friday's close of the week of this

193
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,019
recording

194
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,140
market price is defined as Friday's

195
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,200
close and we would be looking at the

196
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,839
highest high and the lowest low in the

197
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,640
last 20 trading days

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,680
that's our first look back period of 20

199
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,720
trading days

200
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,000
we start looking for bearish mitigation

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
blocks in the premium range a bearish

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,360
breaker liquidity void fair value Gap

203
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,120
bearish order block rejection blocks and

204
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,600
or on Old high or old low

205
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,420
the low market price we identify any

206
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,399
bullish mitigation blocks

207
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,080
a bullish breaker

208
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,820
liquidity void

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,519
a fair value Gap bullish order block

210
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,320
rejection block

211
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,540
or an old low and or high

212
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,339
with that in mind

213
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,200
what I've noted is in the last 20

214
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,140
trading days these are the respective

215
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,839
premium and discount PD arrays in the

216
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,740
last 20 trading days

217
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,660
working our way from the top down we

218
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,459
have an old High

219
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,860
a rejection block

220
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,519
a bearish order block mean threshold

221
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,060
that's the three of candles the ranges

222
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,300
of their bodies highs high and lowest

223
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
low in terms of the bodies not the wicks

224
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,279
that's the mean threshold or Midway

225
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,660
point

226
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,779
then we have the bearish order block

227
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,080
and then we trade down into the discount

228
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,620
area we see a bullish order block

229
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,440
bullish order box mean threshold

230
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,080
the rejection block and then finally the

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,620
old blow

232
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,480
if we move down into a four hour chart

233
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,940
you can see how these PD arrays give you

234
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,459
much more detail you can start to see

235
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,220
how price moves from one PD array to the

236
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,339
next

237
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,160
the market for the Australian dollar

238
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,920
made a higher high on Tuesday

239
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,860
failed to make a higher high and trade

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,880
higher into a monthly range as I had

241
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,700
expected in my analysis

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,680
you're going to learn that having these

243
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
understandings of short-term Trading

244
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,320
it's not required for you to know all

245
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,300
the time exactly where the Market's

246
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,600
going to go if you fail in your analysis

247
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,260
it'll give you an immediate reason to

248
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,779
maybe reverse your analysis and take the

249
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,120
trades in the opposite direction

250
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,220
this was the case this week in our

251
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,600
mentorship

252
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
originally I was long or bullish on the

253
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,220
Australian dollar but the expectation of

254
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,140
a larger price move

255
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,140
it failed to do so on Tuesday

256
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,959
once Tuesday broke down

257
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,180
as you'll see in the later slides in

258
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,459
this presentation we have a lot more

259
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,740
analysis to suggest the price was going

260
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,360
to trade down and close the liquidity

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,260
void

262
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,240
now again this is a four hour chart so

263
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,380
if we saw price fail on Tuesday

264
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,880
and break down lower during Tuesday

265
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,420
we start looking for bearish ideas

266
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,360
inside of the premium range so we look

267
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,660
for all the premium PD arrays to start

268
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,560
keying off all potential cell scenarios

269
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,839
when we sell short

270
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,779
on The Daily PD arrays in the premium

271
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,120
range we would be looking for a lesser

272
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,500
time frame to Target our exit

273
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,360
that would be in the form of a four hour

274
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,000
or one hour chart

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,940
the four hour here shows a clear

276
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,500
liquidity void as outlined here

277
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
price also trades back up into a

278
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,959
mitigation and breaker

279
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,760
trades up to an Institutional price

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,459
level 76.80

281
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,220
and while we're not necessarily needing

282
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,680
the actual high of the week we can still

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,899
take participation in the market move

284
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,839
because we understand that the shift in

285
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,800
order flow has now been moved to bearish

286
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
so we were looking for

287
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,260
discount PD arrays

288
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,600
the low Market action

289
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,720
at 76.80 we were in the premium range

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,180
the void closes and takes us into the

291
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,940
discount range notice that in the Shaded

292
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,420
green area

293
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,279
if we further refine this into the days

294
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,500
of the week on a four hour chart you can

295
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,720
see how this clearly came down and

296
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
closed in the liquidity void

297
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,100
right to the PIP

298
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,220
if we add our Market maker manipulation

299
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,339
template forming the high of the week on

300
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,220
Tuesday trading at an old monthly weekly

301
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,700
and or daily High liquidity pool

302
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,519
that's what we saw on Tuesday it traded

303
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,680
slightly above Monday's high

304
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,220
rejected it once Tuesday broke down

305
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,779
the likelihood that we would see lower

306
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,019
prices was in effect why I said we could

307
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,620
start looking for shorts at 76.80 with

308
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,860
the objective of 7605 as our downside

309
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,240
objective

310
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,300
that was framed as we see on our Market

311
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,740
maker

312
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,320
manipulation template the discount

313
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
Market PD array is going to be used on a

314
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,380
time frame lesser than the premium

315
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,320
liquidity pool that was used so the

316
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,459
daily

317
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,420
high on Monday was violated on Tuesday

318
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,940
that's a liquidity pool raid

319
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
on a daily High

320
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,839
if that's the context we're going to

321
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,000
drop down to a four hour and or a one

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
hour chart

323
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,820
to look for a discount PD array

324
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,360
it comes in the form of liquidity void

325
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,120
taking us down into 7605 was our

326
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
objective

327
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
everything tied together we get a

328
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,199
combination of

329
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,839
elements of time and price

330
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,760
blending

331
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,399
and using the market maker manipulation

332
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,220
templates in accordance to our market

333
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,040
profiles that we used and learned in

334
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,480
lesson two

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
we get a symmetry in the marketplace

336
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,720
that would otherwise probably Escape

337
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,060
everyone else

338
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,100
so hopefully this is

339
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,079
an example

340
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
and understanding and using an example

341
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,620
we used

342
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,260
in live analysis this week

343
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,079
while we were initially wrong and our

344
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,320
expectation of a higher breakout on

345
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,760
Aussie dollar

346
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,880
that failure swing on Tuesday

347
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
gave us Insight on how we can change

348
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,380
gears and get short on Aussie dollar

349
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,440
even while it traded in sympathy with

350
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,480
the weaker dollar which isn't typical

351
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,660
blending the two time and price it gives

352
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,420
us the ability to work within the same

353
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,420
parameters that the algorithm will at

354
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,000
the interbank level

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
hopefully this has been insightful to

356
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,019
you we'll build more on these ideas as

357
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,600
we go through and trade with more

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,079
insights using the ifta data ranges and

359
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,160
PD array Matrix
