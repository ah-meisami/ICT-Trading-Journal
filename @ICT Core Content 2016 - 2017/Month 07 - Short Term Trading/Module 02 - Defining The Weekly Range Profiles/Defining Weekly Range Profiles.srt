00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,500
welcome back to lesson two of short-term

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,780
trading March 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,920
content

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,380
this lesson is defining the weekly range

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,980
profiles

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,119
okay before we get into this let me

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,300
preface it by saying this is one of the

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,700
lessons that if you just look through it

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,340
quickly and not paying much attention to

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,440
it it's going to look rather uh

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
ambiguous it's going to seem unfruitful

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,460
but its impact is shown and solidified

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,219
really by you going through price data

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,340
and seeing these profiles unfold in

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,500
hindsight seeing how they operate how

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,719
they unfold and the conditions that I'm

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,000
giving you how they are always generally

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,420
precursors to them performing

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,340
so the classic Tuesday low of the week

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,159
okay this is a market profile that is

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,540
generally bullish so you're already

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,760
looking for bullish prices anyway

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
and what you're looking for is

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,420
manipulation in the form of price

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,100
hovering above a higher time frame

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,439
discount array on Monday then drops into

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,540
a higher time frame discount array on

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,920
Tuesday to form the low of the week

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,840
how to anticipate this you have to know

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,700
the higher time frame discount arrays

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,380
and when the market fails to drop into

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,080
that array odds are Tuesday we'll likely

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,180
see the drive lower Tuesday London open

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,799
and or

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,060
New York session

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,439
okay the next one is the classic Tuesday

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,420
high of the week

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,540
this Market profile for the week is

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,040
generally bearish you're already

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
expecting lower prices

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
and the manipulation You're Expecting is

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,979
when price is hovering below a higher

43
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,799
time frame premium array Monday then

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,540
Rises into a higher time frame premium

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,460
array on Tuesday to form the high of the

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,579
week

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,899
and you anticipate this forming by

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,818
knowing the higher time frame premium

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,280
arrays and when the market fails to rise

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,379
into that array odds are Tuesday we'll

51
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,360
likely see the drive higher Tuesday's

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,060
London open and or New York session

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,120
just like the classic Tuesday low of the

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
week well the classic high of the week

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,720
there can be another run higher to make

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,640
a higher high in the week for this

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,800
profile than the highest formed in the

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
London session Tuesday so in other words

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
they can come back and run the London

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,560
High out and still form this for the

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,660
classic Tuesday low of the week it can

62
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,760
come back and make a lower low in the

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,319
New York sessions there's one caveat

64
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,700
that has to be applied to both of them

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,780
so have that in your notes

66
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,379
okay the next one is the Wednesday low

67
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,599
of week

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,700
this is when you're generally bullish on

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,480
the marketplace already

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
and the manipulation you're looking for

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,800
is when price is hovering above a higher

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,080
time frame discount array Monday and

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,420
Tuesday then drops into the higher time

74
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,340
frame discount array on Wednesday to

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,180
form the low of the week

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,200
you anticipate this by knowing the

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,120
higher time frame discount arrays and

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,739
when the market fails to drop into that

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,500
array odds are Wednesday will likely see

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,540
the drive lower Wednesday's London open

81
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,000
and or New York session

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,819
Monday and Tuesday can also be down days

83
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,099
as well to form this profile Wednesday

84
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,959
London session low can be ran out on the

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
Wednesday New York session and then it

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,099
can create the low of the week so be be

87
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,540
aware that that can possibly happen as

88
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,720
well

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
okay the next one is the Wednesday high

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,280
of week

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,500
this profile is generally bearish you're

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,519
already looking for lower prices

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,239
and the manipulation You're Expecting is

94
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,920
when price is hovering below a higher

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,019
time frame premium array Monday and

96
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,060
Tuesday then Rises into that higher time

97
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,640
frame premium array on Wednesday to form

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,099
the high of the week

99
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,739
you anticipate this by knowing the

100
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,840
higher time frame premium arrays and

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,459
when the market fails to rise into that

102
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,440
array odds are Wednesday we'll likely

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,180
see the drive higher Wednesdays long and

104
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,180
open and or New York session Monday and

105
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,040
Tuesday can be up days as well to form

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,479
this profile

107
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,280
just like we mentioned for Wednesday low

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,000
of week the London open high on

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Wednesday can be ran out on Wednesday's

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
New York session and still create the

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,340
high of the week so have that in your

112
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,639
notes

113
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,520
okay the next one we have is

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,759
consolidation Thursday reversal

115
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,979
this is a generally bullish Market

116
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,300
condition

117
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,620
so what you're looking for in

118
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,000
manipulation is we're going to be

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
looking for consolidation Monday through

120
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,360
Wednesday

121
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,660
then price runs the entry week low and

122
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,560
rejects it forming a market reversal

123
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,540
the key is it's consolidating it's not

124
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,160
only going higher or lower Monday

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,639
through Wednesday

126
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,220
okay to anticipate this as you have to

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,660
know the higher time frame discount to

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,340
raise and when the market fails to drop

129
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,919
into that array odds are Thursday we'll

130
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,860
likely see the drive lower Thursday on a

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
market driver news and or rate release

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,259
late New York session this is typically

133
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,180
around the two o'clock Eastern Standard

134
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,020
Time

135
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,820
or 2 p.m New York time

136
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,100
okay consolidation Thursday reversal for

137
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,460
a bearish market profile

138
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,979
the manipulation you're looking for is

139
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,820
consolidation Monday through Wednesday

140
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,100
then it runs to enter week high and

141
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,600
rejects it forming a market reversal

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
you anticipate this by knowing the

143
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,500
higher time frame premium arrays and

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,060
when the market fails to rise into that

145
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,460
array odds are Thursday we'll likely see

146
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,320
a drive higher Thursday on a market

147
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,979
driver news or rate release late New

148
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,960
York session around 2 p.m New York time

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,960
now just like we saw for the bullish

150
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,360
consolidation Thursday reversal

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,120
this is generally on rate announcements

152
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,060
fomc or interest rate uh adjustments

153
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,080
okay consolidation midweek rally

154
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,300
this is a bullish Market profile already

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,500
expecting higher prices when you're

156
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,120
looking for this

157
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,340
the manipulation You're Expecting is the

158
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,259
consolidation Monday through Wednesday

159
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,479
then runs the inch week high and then

160
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,520
expands higher into Friday

161
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,800
how to anticipate when the market is

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
bullish and has yet to run to the

163
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,979
premium array on the higher time frames

164
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,039
it has recently rallied from a discount

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
array and simply paused without any

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,720
bearish reversal price action

167
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,580
indicating price is about to expand

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,199
higher for the premium array

169
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,900
consolidation midweek decline

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,479
this is a bearish market profile

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,819
You're Expecting bearish prices and the

172
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,199
manipulation you're looking for is when

173
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,520
price is consolidating Monday through

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,319
Wednesday then runs to enter week low

175
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,120
and expands lower into Friday

176
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,580
you anticipate this profile forming when

177
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,199
the market is bearish and has yet to run

178
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,180
the discount array on the higher time

179
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,940
frames and it has recently declined from

180
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,680
a premium array and simply paused

181
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,259
without any bullish

182
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,940
reversal price action indicating price

183
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,800
is about to expand lower for the

184
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
discount array

185
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,160
Seek and Destroy bullish Friday

186
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,419
this is a neutral or low probability

187
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,800
Market profile

188
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,120
the telltale signs the manipulation is

189
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,120
taking part in this profile is where

190
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,099

246
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,420
simplistic to go through this

247
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,420
squiggly line and a few comments but the

248
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,880
impact is going to be really appreciated

249
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,380
in your understanding when you go

any segment of time go back as far as

254
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,680
you want okay and I want you to break

Moves In what you're seeing in price and

258
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,100
is going on prior to these market

259
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,660
profiles forming

260
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,920
and you're going to see a recurring

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,959
theme that generally the characteristics

262
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,700
that we have outlined here are

263
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,860
precursors to these Market model

264
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560

PD arrays and

271
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,839
