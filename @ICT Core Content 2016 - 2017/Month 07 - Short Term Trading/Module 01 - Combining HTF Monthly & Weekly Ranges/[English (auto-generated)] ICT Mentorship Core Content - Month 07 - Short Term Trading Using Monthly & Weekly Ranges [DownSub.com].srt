00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,019
welcome to March 2017 content for the

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,960
ICT mentorship this month we're teaching

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,320
short-term trading this is lesson one

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
combining higher time frame monthly and

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,060
weekly ranges

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,019
okay folks short-term trading this is my

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,480
cup of tea if you will my go to

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
discipline trading Style

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,960
um in this month we're going to be

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,940
teaching in great detail my one shot one

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,820
kill approach to trading not just the 4X

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,800
Market but all the other uh asset

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
classes will be touched on in scope as

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
we get to those later discussions uh in

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,180
the middle of the summer we will be

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,719
teaching bond trading uh index trading

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,360
stock trading and commodity trading and

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,760
I'll touch on this specific trading

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,160
model in higher detail when I go into

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,820
those respective discussions

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,559
and just so you know it's uh the month

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,020
of June we go through that that Gambit

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,600
if you will of those four different

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,619
asset classes

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,020
all right so what is short-term trading

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,820
it's the practice of trading a duration

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,159
of one week or a few days

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,119
we use both the monthly and weekly

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,180
charts to frame the setups

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,860
we trade in the direction of the present

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,200
or next week's probable range

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,000
it's essential that you understand that

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
the weekly range is going to be the

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,220
backbone to your success in short-term

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,320
trading and I'm going to go through a

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,140
lot of teaching and Concepts as it

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,740
relates to producing consistent results

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,740
when you're looking for forecasting the

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,840
next week or current week's range

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,659
a short-term model can be both Trend or

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,220
range-bound Trading

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
trades that are clear to see forming are

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,660
the goal again specifically with this

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,260
trading model try your best to keep from

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,360
forcing yourself to take a trade if it's

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,060
not obvious it's simply just

47
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,280
you know not clear enough on on your

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,440
charts just simply sit on your hands and

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,080
wait these types of setups form every

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,360
single week there's absolutely no reason

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,120
for you to rush if you do believe me you

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,739
will have psychological tug of war going

53
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,660
on you're gonna have emotional issues

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,640
and the bottom line is your ultimately

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,540
probably going to lose some money

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,459
short-term trading in my opinion is the

57
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,780
highest probability discipline

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
it offers frequent setups and with

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,739
consistency it provides a plethora of

60
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:50,760
Trades

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,379
now before we get into this discussion

62
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,060
about short-term trading let me preface

63
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,620
it by saying

64
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,080
it's important you go through your notes

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
from the January long-term trading model

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
and from February with the swing trading

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
model notes because those notes will

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,459
complement this specific

69
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,340
whole entire month it'd be very easy for

70
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,580
me to load you down with rehash of

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,500
everything that was discussed in January

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,480
and February but what I want to do is I

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
want to keep things moving along number

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,220
one I want the lessons to be fresh and I

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,920
also want you to be

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,480
forced if you will to go back to your

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,940
notes it's simply me giving you the PF

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,080
File is not enough you need to be

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,879
referring to them every single month you

80
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,500
get something new when you finish that

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,420
new month go back from the previous

82
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,159
months and go through all those lessons

83
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,720
again and yes it takes a lot of time

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,580
that's why we're doing a 12-month

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,680
mentorship it takes a great deal of time

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,780
to go through this information to digest

87
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,879
it to retain it and then to be able to

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
use it it's simply not enough to give me

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,540
this and then I'll know what to do it's

90
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,680
not it doesn't work like that and

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,940
obviously some of you already realize

92
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,799
that and it's requiring you a great deal

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,659
more work but the ones that are doing it

94
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,400
guess what you already see the fruits of

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,120
that so while many of the folks on the

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,620
internet think they understand how I do

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,239
one shot one kill

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,860
believe me there's a whole lot of things

99
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,680
that I did not reveal in the first four

100
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,200
lessons of this month will look somewhat

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,939
like you have already seen it already

102
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,918
but there's subtle nuances especially

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,459
with one specific uh component that I'm

104
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,839
going to release at the very last slide

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
in this presentation I want you to be

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,020
really focused on because it really is

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,880
in my opinion one of the telltale signs

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
that you got a tiger by the tail in

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,780
other words you have a big move still

110
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,880
and I'll get to that when we get to the

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,259
last slide in this presentation but I

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,259
want you to know that when we go through

113
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,280
short-term trading this is my favorite

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,979
form of trading if I can't find a setup

115
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,320
for one shot one kill the next thing I'm

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,940
doing is day trading and guess what we

117
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,280
teach that next month but this month and

118
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,620
next this is where I excel as a Trader

119
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,400
because of my personal unique uh makeup

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,259
as a Trader and as a person my

121
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,380
psychology about things in nature is

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,940
very short term I can change my mind

123
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,360
very quick I can make a decision rather

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,060
quickly so that means that I can do very

125
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,759
well in this specific discipline of

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
trading and with intraday day trading so

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,740
while this may not be your particular

128
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,840
style Trading

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,699
trust me I'm going to teach you things

130
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,560
in this month and next month that will

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,039
help you really really Excel as a

132
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,080
long-term Trader or a swing Trader

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,180
everything Blends together that's why we

134
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,440
have to do these things from a higher

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,479
time frame down and we go back to the

136
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,400
higher time frame and fill in gaps that

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,740
were left there intentionally some of

138
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,539
you have scratched your head saying well

139
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,740
wait a minute I feel like there's some

140
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,120
things missing from the swing trading

141
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,800
model the things that are missing will

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
be helped by filling in with the short

143
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
term because everything is modular

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,180
everything is complementary as we go

145
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,039
through deeper study on this mentorship

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,600
so as we get down to the smaller time

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,699
frames everything fills in and then

148
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,080
you'll go back in the higher time frames

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,580
and say okay now I know what I'm doing I

150
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,840
know what I'm looking for and everything

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,000
fit together like a dovetail perfectly

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,000
okay as a reminder every discipline we

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,580
will always be re referring to the PD

154
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,460
array Matrix and I want to not just go

155
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,020
over everything that you've seen here so

156
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,199
far and I'm not trying to you belaborate

157
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
but it's important we understand that

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,699
as a short-term Trader especially for

159
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,800
one shot one kill which is the like the

160
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,440
flagship of this month's content

161
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,479
that's what I'm that's my Hallmark as a

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,280
Trader I mean that that's what makes ICT

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,800
Woody is you know I I can trade the

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,840
weekly range and get pretty close to

165
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,460
what the high and low is for the week

166
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,259
and you've already seen many examples of

167
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,880
me called the intraday highs and lows

168
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
before the fact within one or two Pips

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
and sometimes rate on the PIP

170
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
those same components are applicable to

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,460
the weekly range which if you really

172
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,840
stop and think about that

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,539
think about the Sunday open to Friday's

174
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,240
close how many Pips is offered over that

175
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,660
time period a lot tons so if you can

176
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,340
really focus in on what we're teaching

177
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,380
this month even if it's not going to be

178
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,780
your discipline of choice or style of

179
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,800
trading

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,660
it will give you a greater Insight on

181
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,460
how you can reduce your risk trading as

182
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,520
a swing Trader and or a long-term Trader

183
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,960
but

184
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,660
as it relates to PD array Matrix this is

185
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,340
again the backbone to what we look for

186
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,039
and how we frame our trades okay so it

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,840
ends up in every one of our teachings as

188
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,400
we go forward in each new discipline

189
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,860
this slide will always be there because

190
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,840
I want to ingrained in your brain okay

191
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,880
because this is what I do from an

192
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,860
Institutional mindset I look for how the

193
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,319
institutions will move from a premium to

194
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,419
a discount array or from a discount

195
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,759
array to a premium array you have to

196
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,080
understand that and just an example

197
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
let's just take a look at one real quick

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
it's saying we looked at the market and

199
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,720
it just recently filled in a fair value

200
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
Gap okay and we think the Market's

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,400
bearish well we go through this uh

202
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,780
process of looking for potential future

203
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,599
discount PD arrays and we look and we

204
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,039
can't see anything in terms of the

205
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,840
bullish mitigation block we don't see

206
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,819
any bullish Breakers there's no

207
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,419
liquidity void but there is no fair

208
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,979
value gift either

209
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,560
all of a sudden it reduces us down to a

210
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,780
bullish order block so if we're looking

211
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,060
at a monthly higher time frame premium

212
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,979
array we're looking for a

213
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,000
opposing weekly discount array

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,039
so in this case we'd be looking for the

215
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,539
movement from a fair value Gap that has

216
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,339
filled in at a premium level we're

217
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,620
dropping down and looking for a weekly

218
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,399
discount array and if our analysis leads

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
us to only a bullish order block below

220
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,140
us in the weekly format or time frame

221
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,120
that's the range that we're going to be

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,459
looking for that's your potential range

223
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,800
that's how much you can frame your risk

224
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,140
to reward model that's the range you're

225
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,660
trading that's not

226
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,940
um to be broken up and looked at as okay

227
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,880
well if this range is 300 Pips I'm just

228
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,140
going to take 20 Pips and be done with

229
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,540
it no you're going to look to frame your

230
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,640
trades as you scale out you're holding

231
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,959
for these longer term objectives

232
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
throughout the week you're going to be

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,260
learning to take some profits along the

234
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,060
way but you're holding out ultimately

235
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,100
with that last portion of your trade to

236
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,420
get down to that bullish order block

237
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,459
this is just one example it could be any

238
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,940
combination of how a premium moved to a

239
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,580
discount array or a discount array moves

240
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,620
up to a premium terms of reaching for

241
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,720
how the market May reach in terms of

242
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,339
moving higher or lower

243
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,459
and I'll say this in simple terms

244
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,420
all we're doing is looking for a monthly

245
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,260
PD array whether it's discount or

246
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,320
premium based on our next logical price

247
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
move has it gone most likely higher or

248
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,519
lower from where we're right now and we

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,240
move from a monthly PD array now if it's

250
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
bullish obviously we're gonna be

251
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,899
focusing on a monthly discount array if

252
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,880
it's bearish we're looking for a premium

253
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
monthly array

254
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,140
from that monthly array

255
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,060
you're going to look for an opposing

256
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,300
weekly array so if we're starting from a

257
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,100
premium and a monthly basis you're gonna

258
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,620
be looking for a weekly discount that's

259
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,120
your target you're looking for that

260
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,040
range to close in or the market to be

261
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,660
drawn to that level

262
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,800
now

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,420
if you're not really paying attention if

264
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,640
that didn't hit you hard believe me when

265
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,959
you go through all your charts go back

266
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,760
and look at every major move that's

267
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,220
what's been going on that's what makes

268
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,440
my ability to call the markets from one

269
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,140
level to the next and be pretty solid in

270
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,339
terms of why I think the Market's going

271
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,959
to go One Direction over the other when

272
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,519
I'm not confident about that it's

273
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,320
because I don't I don't know which

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,779
PD array is going to be used next so I'm

275
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,360
waiting for more information or the PD

276
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
arrays have been expired they've already

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
been traded to so you have to look for

278
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
something new and that means you have to

279
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
wait but guess what that does it gives

280
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,040
you context and also gives you patience

281
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
it gives you the ability to wait now you

282
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,920
know what you're waiting for because

283
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,540
right now I can't do anything

284
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,940
so when we go through this process of

285
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,519
eliminating or what's available in terms

286
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,620
of active PD arrays

287
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,079
we start from a monthly where what is

288
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,880
the monthly PD array that we're most

289
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,519
actively traded from is it coming off of

290
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
a bear shorter block okay great so

291
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
what's the weekly discount already it's

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
going to be reaching for there may not

293
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,480
be a mitigation block there may not be a

294
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,459
bullish breaker there may not be a void

295
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,959
or a gap there may not even be a bullish

296
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,180
order block that you could Fame around

297
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,740
confidence

298
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,620
it may be a series of all Down Candles

299
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
so what does that mean you look for a

300
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,180
rejection block or an old low an old

301
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,480
High

302
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,980
another example would be if we were

303
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,800
looking from a discount monthly array up

304
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
into a weekly premium array we could be

305
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
looking for the market moving from a

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,060
bullish breaker for instance and we

307
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,500
could potentially look for the market to

308
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
possibly run to an old high or an old

309
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,860
low

310
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,740
again that would be your potential range

311
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,079
this is the maximum you're leaving your

312
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,200
portion of your trade on to reach for it

313
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
may not get to these objectives but if

314
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,800
you leave a little piece on many times

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,839
you're going to find that if you do this

316
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,420
you can actually make more than the

317
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,920
trade if you had on the full position

318
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,380
and left it you know to your first

319
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,880
objective and just simply took it all

320
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
off there that small little portion if

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,140
you leave it on and you hold it for your

322
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,660
maximum potential that little portion

323
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,579
many times will be what you would be

324
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,220
making entirely if you just took first

325
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,779
profit at a smaller lesser objective

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,500
okay higher time frame sequence we've

327
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
seen this slide before but now we're

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,980
making one more addition and we're

329
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,560
making some additional notes as well

330
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,820
when we're looking for shorting

331
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,139
opportunities we're moving from a

332
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,060
monthly chart cell program it means

333
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,380
we're looking for the market to move

334
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,680
away from a premium array

335
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,480
and we're moving down into the lower

336
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,800
time frame which will be the weekly

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,839
chart and we're looking for it to become

338
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,120
a cell program as well so we're looking

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,680
for the market to move away from its

340
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,320
premium arrays down into a lower time

341
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,180
frame daily or watching for price to

342
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,920
move away from its

343
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,500
individual premium arrays down into a

344
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,300
four hour chart looking for a cell

345
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,160
program as well moving away from its

346
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,800
premium raise down into a one hour chart

347
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200
where we're again looking for the market

348
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,660
to move away from their premium arrays

349
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,240
so if we look at the slide here to the

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,019
right

351
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,720
we have the monthly the weekly the daily

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,240
the four hour and the one hour and we're

353
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
focusing on the monthly chart is we're

354
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,200
looking for a premium array to trade off

355
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
of North that's going to be our point of

356
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
origin

357
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,120
from the monthly weekly daily and four

358
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,880
hour these time frames you're scanning

359
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,160
searching and trying to determine all of

360
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,980
the PD arrays not just premium and not

361
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,480
just discount we're looking for all of

362
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,060
them from each time frame because all of

363
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,339
them will give us potentially new setups

364
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,959
short-term trading or one shot kill

365
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,279
setups

366
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,380
and also

367
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,200
if we're looking for a move in this case

368
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,720
a selling opportunity and we're framing

369
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,760
it off of a monthly PD array from a

370
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,620
premium level that means we're in

371
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,600
basically an overbought condition and

372
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
we're going to be watching and expecting

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,839
the price to move lower to trade down

374
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,720
into a weekly discount

375
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,360
so if we're going to look at the monthly

376
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
the weekly dealing for our own both

377
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
premium and discount basis as we've

378
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,579
already talked about in previous

379
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,680
disciplines and teachings

380
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,500
in December and January when we do this

381
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,660
if we're bearish if we're looking for

382
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,300
the monthly premium arrays to influence

383
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,920
price to go lower

384
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,380
why is it important to look at the

385
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,000
monthly weekly daily and four hour

386
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,180
discount arrays

387
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,279
because we're looking for these arrays

388
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,519
in the discount form to break

389
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,620
we want to see them break

390
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,000
and we want to see them continuously

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,160
keep breaking until we get down to our

392
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,959
weekly

393
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,100
discount array

394
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,199
so for framing a monthly premium PD

395
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,279
array

396
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,440
we're expecting lower prices from a

397
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,699
monthly level

398
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,320
and we're trying to get down into a

399
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,899
weekly discount now it could be any one

400
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,639
of the discount arrays

401
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,740
whichever one appears on the chart or

402
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,720
the market that you're trading not every

403
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,180
pair or Market has every single discount

404
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,320
array

405
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,139
there's only a few that can exist very

406
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,639
rarely have you ever seen more than

407
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,720
three

408
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,180
so if you focus on what you're looking

409
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,980
for in terms of monthly down into a

410
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,820
daily

411
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,399
it gives you a very clear-cut thing to

412
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
look for there's not a a plethora of

413
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,079
things to choose from or well there's so

414
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,279
many things that could be Michael you

415
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,720
know which level is it no it's very

416
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,620
obvious

417
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,720
we're framing the market contextually

418
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,779
and conceptually so it gives us a way to

419
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,040
break down the marketplace and Define

420
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,519
where that market May most and obviously

421
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,839
likely reach to

422
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,339
so we're Scouting For opposing PD arrays

423
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,260
from the monthly down into a weekly

424
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,500
discount so again monthly premium level

425
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,420
and we're trying to look for an opposing

426
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,339
weekly pdra

427
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,360
in the form of a discount

428
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,639
from that monthly premium array

429
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,519
we drop down into a weekly

430
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,220
daily and four hour at every premium

431
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,920
array for each one of those time frames

432
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,860
and we're scanning for all of the

433
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,839
premium arrays where we can take

434
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,779
short-term trades from as a short

435
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,760
every one of those at the weekly daily

436
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,800
and four hour if we find a level like

437
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,959
that we refine it all the way to the one

438
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,699
hour chart our one hour chart is our

439
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,680
executable time frame for one shot one

440
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,100
kills or short-term Trading

441
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,320
once you have that executed what we're

442
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,420
doing is we're aiming for that Weekly

443
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,279
discount PD array

444
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,860
there's your cycle that's your process

445
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,339
that's your whole uh outline if you will

446
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,779
what we do with the information we

447
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,339
learned from January and February and

448
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,899
what we're learning so far is we're

449
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,000
taking all this conceptually and

450
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,679
breaking it down into a user-friendly

451
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,299
format

452
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,359
we want a monthly premium array

453
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,559
and

454
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,520
we start there we're looking for a

455
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,799
opposing weekly discount

456
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,959
whatever that range is it may be

457
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,640
hundreds of Pips or it could be a

458
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,559
thousand Pips I don't know it's going to

459
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,380
be unique to each market and environment

460
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,720
but we may have missed the real

461
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,580
opportunity to trade off of that monthly

462
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,960
premium maybe you just sat down the

463
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,460
insurance said oh look at this it's

464
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,080
coming off of a monthly bearish order

465
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,820
block so it's already moved away from it

466
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,140
you can't really use that to trade off

467
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,880
of you just know that it's moving lower

468
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,320
so what do you do next you drop down to

469
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,299
a weekly what's the weekly premium

470
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,340
arrays there may be one it trades up to

471
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,520
later on or a daily chart it may trade

472
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,780
up into a daily premium array or a four

473
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
hour

474
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,559
one of those four time frames is going

475
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,880
to give you a setup

476
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,919
based on the fact that the monthly

477
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,940
premium

478
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,860
is overbought

479
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,440
most likely are going to trade lower and

480
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,059
we're going to be looking for a lesser

481
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,520
time frame discount array what's less

482
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,740
than a monthly a weekly

483
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,840
we execute regardless if it's on a

484
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,760
weekly daily or four hour premium level

485
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,580
from a one hour chart

486
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,919
we get down to the discount on a weekly

487
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,100
that's our objective

488
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,820
throughout the time from that execution

489
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,340
if it's a weekly or it's a monthly level

490
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,440
we could potentially see multiple

491
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,299
short-term trades form

492
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,580
if it's from a four hour basis you won't

493
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,799
see that many charge setups form but

494
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,299
nonetheless there's still gonna be high

495
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,720
probability

496
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,760
okay for buying opportunities the same

497
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
thing is this repeated this in opposite

498
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,260
we're going to be looking for a monthly

499
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,179
chart by program so we're going to be

500
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,299
looking at a monthly discount array

501
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,500
and we're gonna be looking for it to go

502
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,700
into a buy program in which we're

503
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,380
expecting higher prices

504
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,360
weekly chart we drop down into it and we

505
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
start looking for all the discount PD

506
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,559
arrays as well

507
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,500
and we look for the daily chart to also

508
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,140
move away from its discount arrays and

509
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,520
then dropping them to a lower four hour

510
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,500
and then alternating down to a one hour

511
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,260
chart looking at all of the discount PD

512
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,660
arrays to offer support and price but

513
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,160
ultimately we're framing it off of

514
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,720
whatever the monthly chart discount

515
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,179
array is that's the beginning basis

516
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,020
point

517
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,460
so we're starting from a monthly level

518
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,980
we're finding a discount if we're

519
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,580
oversold or for any uh really deep

520
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,900
discount Market in other words it's

521
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,299
traded for a long time lower and we

522
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,039
found some old institutional price

523
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,919
models for bullish

524
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
institutional order flow for instance a

525
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
bullish order block an old high or an

526
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,620
old low whatever is caused the market to

527
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,020
trade higher in the past all those are

528
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,120
potential scenarios

529
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,480
we're looking for a lower time frame

530
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,820
opposing PD array

531
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
in this case we're looking for a weekly

532
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,880
premium array we're scouting opposing PD

533
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,380
arrays but we're starting from that

534
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,740
monthly basis for a discount so the

535
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,240
Lesser time frame from a monthly is a

536
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,280
weekly and the opposing from a discount

537
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,620
is premium so we're looking for an over

538
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,000
sold condition on a monthly to a

539
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,940
higher time frame premium array that

540
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,620
would be seen on a weekly chart so that

541
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,140
would give us a relatively intermediate

542
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,120
term overbought scenario it helps us

543
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,100
frame the model without using any

544
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,580
indicators

545
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,559
once we arrive at discount monthly PD

546
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,780
arrays we go down through the monthly

547
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,220
the weekly the daily and the four hour

548
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,980
to reference all of its individual

549
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,340
unique discount arrays

550
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,960
every single one of these even if we

551
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,900
missed the monthly discount array

552
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,059
and prices already moved away from it we

553
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,860
can't use it but we can refer to it as

554
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,500
an indication that markets wanting to go

555
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,720
higher so therefore we're identifying

556
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,179
that Weekly premium level as a Target so

557
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,160
whatever that range is that's what we're

558
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,140
waiting for it to trade up to between

559
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,080
them two points there may be thousand or

560
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,780
hundreds of Pips in terms of the

561
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,980
difference between the monthly discount

562
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,580
level and the weekly premium

563
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,380
so we drop down to the weekly the daily

564
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,419
and the four hour for all of the

565
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,640
discount PD arrays but which order

566
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,679
blocks bullish Breakers bullish

567
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,960
mitigation blocks liquidity voids below

568
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,480
current market Action Fair Value gaps

569
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840

570
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,260
blocks old candle bodies with long Wicks

571
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,360
below it uh maybe want to reach down

572
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
below that or it could be just a run on

573
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,440
an old low or return back to an old high

574
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,419
historically

575
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,360
those are all discount arrays we look

576
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,919
for them from the monthly and then drop

577
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,900
down to a weekly find whatever they are

578
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,400
there on that time frame then the daily

579
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,559
and the four hour any one of those time

580
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,720
frames okay we're searching and

581
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,179
determining whatever the PD arrays are

582
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,159
from the discount basis but we're

583
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,840
framing the directional move from the

584
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,880
monthly

585
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,640
we time all of those potential setups

586
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,340
with the one hour chart

587
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,860
aiming for that Weekly premium array and

588
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,960
again it could be multiple short-term

589
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,080
trades forming between the monthly the

590
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,000
weekly and daily

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,940
getting to that Weekly premium array

592
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,679
again if we drop down to a four hour

593
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,659
chart once we get into the four hour the

594
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,580
trades start to fall off a lot in terms

595
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,659
of the frequency or multitude

596
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,580
okay if we look at how we can use the

597
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,799
same model dropping down from a weekly

598
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,820
chart

599
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,919
we can start from a weekly premium

600
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,740
looking into a lower time frame daily

601
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,059
discount

602
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,740
and we're gonna be scouting opposing PD

603
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,919
arrays respectively

604
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,559
and from a weekly from to daily to a

605
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,880
four hour we're looking for all the

606
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
premium arrays that we could short from

607
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,260
and we key off of whatever they are we

608
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,120
wait for price to trade to them and then

609
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,980
we use the one hour chart to sell short

610
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,520
from that's our executable time frame

611
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,039
aiming for that lower level time frame

612
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,360
daily discount

613
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,419
this my friends is the one shot one kill

614
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,500
setup

615
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,480
this is my bread and butter this is the

616
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,760
one that has consistent setups every

617
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,500
single week There's Something to trade

618
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,080
off of but you have to go through the

619
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,940
process of waiting for it to give it to

620
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,059
you

621
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,620
the opposite is same here when we're

622
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,679
looking for a weekly discount

623
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,440
ing an opposing PD array for daily

624
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
premium level

625
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,120
we drop down from the weekly the daily

626
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,860
and the four hour looking for all the

627
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,799
discount PD arrays executing on any one

628
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,880
of them

629
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,919
from a one hour chart

630
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,900
and again this is the one shot one kill

631
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,980
setup for longs

632
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,500
okay we talked about the swing trade

633
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,760
progression

634
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,380
and it's important to bring this back up

635
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,580
again because

636
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,159
without this understanding it's going to

637
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,360
be a little

638
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,340
too vague

639
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,500
but I gave you a model at which we

640
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,760
thought that maybe this is a six month

641
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,159
outlook on price okay maybe it's a

642
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,900
little aggressive to say six months but

643
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,220
just sort of sake of argument and

644
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,320
discussion let's just say this whole

645
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,179
entire range of higher highs and higher

646
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,419
lows is six months and we had the

647
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,460
benefit of forecasting the potential

648
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,620
move to see this unfold each one of

649
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,440
these price legs has a impulse leg and

650
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,700
it has a retracement then it's an

651
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,620
expansion swing

652
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,900
inside of each individual impulse swing

653
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,600
there could be smaller impulse and

654
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
expansion swings

655
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,940
each expansion swing again just like we

656
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,500
saw in the impulse swing could be broken

657
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,140
down to a smaller time frame seeing its

658
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,900
own individual unique impulse swing and

659
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,820
expansion swing

660
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,260
and this is repeated throughout the

661
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,620
entire fractal that is seen in price

662
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,580
as a short-term Trader with this alone

663
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,419
there is a plethora of many many setups

664
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,220
and signals that you can find just

665
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,700
trading with one market one pair

666
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,820
if this is a whole

667
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,620
landscape if you will of six months of

668
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,640
price data this could be every load that

669
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,860
it trades from And Trades higher every

670
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,539
single time it makes a loan moves up

671
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,820
graphically that is a potential

672
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,799
short-term trade

673
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,260
so just from this chart alone if you

674
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,059
take a moment and count every time it

675
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,520
creates a move up

676
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,799
use that lowest point at which you could

677
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,559
frame a short-term trade count them I'll

678
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,580
give you a moment to do so

679
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,460
there's potentially just on Longs

680
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,860
there's eight short-term setups here

681
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,020
just by breaking the fractal down one

682
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,100
scale

683
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,679
but we can go further than that

684
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,840
and break down the smaller swings into

685
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,460
their individual impulse swing

686
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,100
retracement and expansion swing

687
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,799
and it's smaller expansion swing can be

688
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,720
further broken down

689
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,059
each individual fractal

690
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,039
can be broken down to a lesseractile now

691
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,539
if we count how many opportunities you

692
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,640
could be a buyer when you're bullish and

693
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,820
you can frame the marketplace correctly

694
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,620
how many opportunities do you see here

695
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,240
in terms of potential buys

696
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,559
there's potentially 16 buying

697
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,860
opportunities in this overall fractal

698
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,260
that's not counting any short-term

699
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,640
trades that you could have done on all

700
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,080
the retracements

701
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,720
every little red section in here they

702
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,760
could also be short-term trades as well

703
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,440
if we couple those with the buying

704
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,900
opportunities there is a great deal more

705
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,179
trades that are available as a

706
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,900
short-term Trader

707
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,159
okay the general concept Revisited

708
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,840
we're looking for a market that is

709
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,220
poised to trade higher on a higher time

710
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,500
frame now we're going to be looking for

711
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,779
seasonal Tendencies to help us we don't

712
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,460
require it but they're always going to

713
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,080
be a bonus and we're looking for

714
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
interest rate driven conditions in other

715
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,000
words is there the

716
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
bond market is it moving is it stagnant

717
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,740
it's going sideways preferably we're

718
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,940
looking for a market that's moving

719
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,159
around uh dust commitment Traders

720
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,779
support the hedging program about the

721
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,159
commercials are they buying are they

722
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,440
selling in this case if we're looking

723
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
for a bull scenario we're looking for

724
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,080
commercials to be lessening their short

725
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,360
positions or aggressively adding or

726
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,220
already net long

727
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,020
and we're using inter-market analysis to

728
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,279
support bullishness that could be in the

729
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,140
form of supporting

730
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,880
with

731
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,460
smt Divergence or

732
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,020
correlated pair

733
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,799
smt

734
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,520
we're looking for a market that rallies

735
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,380
higher than retraces and this is going

736
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,720
to occur Monday through Wednesday so now

737
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,940
we're getting more time specific

738
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,919
and then we look for the market to

739
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,380
expand up into higher highs

740
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,900
so before we do anything we're going to

741
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,299
already have our point of origin in

742
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,020
other words that's going to be the

743
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,039
reference point from the monthly

744
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,779
standpoint and or dropping down to the

745
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,820
weekly daily and four hour

746
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,700
and we're going to know what PD array in

747
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,559
the premium we're aiming for

748
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,539
so we see that impulse swing

749
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,580
Monday Tuesday or Wednesday we were

750
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,380
looking for an up move to suggest it is

751
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
in fact buying

752
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
so that impulse swing is The Telltale

753
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,340
sign that there are smart money players

754
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,380
in the marketplace pushing price higher

755
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,360
that's what we're looking for underlying

756
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,580
we're expecting higher prices anyway but

757
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,320
now we're seeing it

758
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,900
we're waiting for the retracement that

759
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,400
retracement is going to come again

760
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,620
between Monday Tuesday and Wednesday it

761
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,179
could happen directly right off of

762
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,460
Sunday's rally and then Monday may be

763
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,659
the retracement or it could just start

764
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:52,980
right from Monday and have a very

765
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,500
shallow retracement of one day

766
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,279
between Monday and and Wednesday

767
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
during that retracement we're going to

768
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,299
be looking for or anticipating the next

769
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,880
move higher driving its

770
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,120
move higher into that premium array that

771
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,340
we're looking for

772
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,900
that expansion swing is where we're

773
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,539
looking to be profitable

774
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,059
framing the retracement from the point

775
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,340
of origin that's where we're looking for

776
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,820
our executable time frame hourly

777
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,440
four hour

778
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,539
daily weekly monthly discount PD array

779
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,520
we're looking for all those potential

780
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,340
levels as price starts to drop down now

781
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,020
it looks like graphically it's only on

782
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,720
Wednesday but for the sake of discussion

783
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,320
and keeping the the slide clean this

784
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,240
retracement and the discount PD array

785
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,220
Matrix is applied through the entire

786
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,020
range across the days of Monday Tuesday

787
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,179
and Wednesday so in other words what I'm

788
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,100
saying is from Monday Tuesday and

789
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,200
Wednesday during any retracement lower

790
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
we're looking for a monthly weekly daily

791
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,700
four hour

792
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,299
discount array the trade-off of

793
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,539
aiming for the weekly

794
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,860
premium array

795
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
and it has to drop down into

796
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,220
a Killzone

797
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,779
now

798
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,120
what kill zones could you be trading uh

799
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,620
obviously you all know that I like to

800
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,120
trade the London open and I like to

801
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,100
trade in New York open

802
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,320
ly trading the Aussie kiwi or Japanese

803
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,740
Yen you want to be including the Asian

804
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,860
session Killzone okay so you can go into

805
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,140
my free tutorial stuff and see what that

806
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,679
actually is but for a quick down dirty

807
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,299
uh time frame what you're looking for is

808
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,700
2300 hours to

809
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,380
well basically you're going to be

810
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,460
looking at 6 p.m to 9 P.M

811
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,260
New York Standard Time

812
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,419
whatever time is in New York

813
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,120
6 p.m to 9 00 p.m there's your sweet

814
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,520
spot for Asia okay there you go nothing

815
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,460
nothing easier than that now and many

816
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,080
times it can extend to 10 o'clock but

817
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,919
usually you don't want to be doing

818
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,020
anything after 10 uh the closer you get

819
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,039
to 10 that's kind of like their lunch

820
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,000
time so you don't want to do anything

821
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,720
around 10.

822
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,020
and ultimately if price drops down gives

823
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,539
you retracement into a discount PD array

824
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,159
from a monthly weekly daily or four hour

825
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,240
level

826
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,240
you can see that also can be used from

827
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,460
an hourly executable time frame so if

828
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,600
you get a hourly discount PD array

829
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,399
they could be executed on as well inside

830
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,679
of a Kill Zone again you're looking for

831
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,539
that Monday Tuesday and Wednesday set up

832
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:37,380
but you're aiming for the weekly PD

833
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,539
array if you don't watch online kill

834
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,260
you're looking for that daily PDA right

835
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,299
but framing off of a weekly discount

836
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,220
okay the general concept Revisited again

837
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,260
in bearish markets we're looking for a

838
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,760
market that's poised to trade lower on a

839
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,100
higher time frame we're looking for any

840
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,840
Market that would potentially move lower

841
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
seasonally but it doesn't have to we

842
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,440
don't need to seasonal fancy there again

843
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,059
it's just always a bonus or a plus if

844
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,340
you will if we can use a market that has

845
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,679
a bearish seasonal tendency

846
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,299
our interest rates moving are they

847
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,100
stagnant uh preferably we're looking for

848
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,600
a market that has the bond market moving

849
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,340
all around the

850
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,080
tenure notes are moving around that's

851
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,419
held in consolidation

852
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,340
and commitment to Traders are we looking

853
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,860
at a Lessing of long positions by the

854
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,320
commercials or are we seeing a heavily

855
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,419
net short position being built or are

856
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,760
they already net short those are the

857
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,200
conditions we're looking for from a cot

858
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,960
standpoint and inter-market Analysis

859
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,700
supports the bearishness that means smt

860
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,700
diversions is indicating weakness or

861
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,700
correlated pair smt suggests that there

862
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,760
should be a overall sympathy move lower

863
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
for foreign currencies or for trading

864
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,899
stocks you'll learn all that as well

865
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,779
with the indices versus the leadership

866
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,399
issues

867
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,860
and we're looking for a market decline

868
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,200
lower than retrace higher during Monday

869
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,860
into Wednesday

870
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,399
and then we're going to be looking for a

871
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,659
market to expand down to lower lows

872
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,240
so we have our point of origin

873
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,820
from a higher time frame monthly premium

874
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,100
array

875
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,380
it trades lower

876
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,840
impulse swing and then there's a

877
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,279
retracement again this is all occurring

878
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,159
between Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday

879
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,500
any one of those three days this

880
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
scenario or condition has to be here

881
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,080
that retracement has to come up to

882
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,080
a level of Premium

883
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,539
and then the expansion swing is what

884
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,700
we're looking for to be profitable in

885
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,380
aiming for the discount array

886
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,899
we're framing our trade with premium

887
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,000
array Matrix so we're looking for a

888
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,399
monthly weekly daily four hour and one

889
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,460
hour premium array to Short from

890
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,640
in a Kill Zone

891
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,620
for time the analysis

892
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,679
okay monthly ranges

893
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,960
our price is fractal and higher time

894
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,679
frame analysis benefits us as a result

895
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,300
we note the high and the low of every

896
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,760
month candle

897
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,619
we note the present range in terms of

898
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,379
premium and or discount

899
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,239
we consider where price on the monthly

900
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,639
will or could draw to in other words

901
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,780
what's the most likely Direction

902
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,159
there is generally four weekly candles

903
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,859
in every monthly candle

904
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,080
every week we study where the monthly

905
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,540
will likely trade next

906
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,800
again

907
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,879
all we're doing is looking for

908
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,619
probabilities there's nothing that I

909
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,899
teach with 100 iron clad this is the way

910
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:46,918
it's going to happen every single time

911
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,500
there's no absolutions

912
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,719
there's only probability so we're

913
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,699
looking from these higher time frames to

914
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,899
look for where is it most likely

915
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,219
reaching for it because if we're trading

916
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,780
off of a monthly chart and we can pick

917
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,520
the most probable Direction chances are

918
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,640
even if we're wrong you know the lower

919
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,599
time frames that we're going to be

920
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,980
executing on still might give us

921
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,440
opportunity to be paid

922
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,140
and in usually monthly ranges we frame

923
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,460
trades on the weekly range

924
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,079
all right so what's a weekly range

925
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,599
uh again price is fractal and monthly

926
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,180
analysis Builds on the weekly

927
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,800
and we know to high in the low of every

928
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,780
weekly candle

929
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,520
we note the present range in terms of

930
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,420
Premium indoor discount

931
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,140
we consider where price on the weekly

932
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,180
will or could draw to again what's the

933
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,560
most probable Direction in terms of

934
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,839
where the weekly chart is trading and

935
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,160
where it may rage up or below or two

936
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,660
there's generally five daily candles in

937
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,119
every weekly candle

938
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,220
and every week we study how the weekly

939
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,560
trades inside of its monthly range

940
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,119
using weekly ranges we frame trades on

941
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,160
the daily chart

942
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,119
we're watching to see if the weeklies

943
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,579
continuously expand and make the larger

944
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,920
monthly candle

945
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,420
move in the direction we thought they

946
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,560
were going to go

947
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,000
so each week we're looking for

948
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,240
Confluence and confirmation that will be

949
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,980
anticipated seeing on the monthly is in

950
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,200
fact unfolding because the weeklies will

951
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,940
be pushing that direction hopefully in

952
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,700
our favor and then making that Weekly

953
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,020
range expand every higher or every lower

954
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,240
uh weekly candle we'll build that bigger

955
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,040
monthly candle in respective Direction

956
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,320
okay so let's take a look at an example

957
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,880
all right so here we're looking at the

958
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,920
Japanese Yen this is a monthly chart and

959
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,940
you can see from 2015

960
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,599
Springtime going into June 2015. we saw

961
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,400
the Japanese Yen

962
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
or dollar Yen pair trade up into around

963
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,740
the 125.80 level or thereabouts

964
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,920
and we moved from a low formed back in

965
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
2013

966
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,920
and then we dropped from the 125s into

967
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
around June of 2016.

968
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,200
if you look at the total range we have

969
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
obviously moved into a discount market

970
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,880
and we look at the markets

971
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,579
old support levels found at

972
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,900
the February 2014 to June 2014 there was

973
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,640
a lot of support seen in there

974
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,400
so products came all the way down into

975
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
the point of origin where we think the

976
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,300
market will and with the benefit of

977
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,099
hindsight here I'm not going to be

978
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,260
slicing and dicing charts because we

979
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,320
called the Japanese Yen lower which is

980
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,800
dollar Yen higher all through the uh the

981
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,220
months in 2016 as we see here

982
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,619
but looking at this example we have a

983
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,119
point of origin where we think price may

984
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,980
want to go higher and once we see that

985
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,900
we start looking at all of the monthly

986
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,740
discount PD arrays I'm framing the last

987
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,020
down candle right before the Big Move

988
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,720
starts to take place that is a monthly

989
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,859
candle and we start looking at the

990
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,960
monthly range but that's not the monthly

991
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,940
range we're trading in that's just a

992
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,460
monthly range so don't be this don't be

993
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,079
confused when I start talking about

994
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,780
monthly ranges I may interchangeably

995
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,880
refer to a monthly candle where it's

996
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,640
individual or independent range that's

997
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,079
not the monthly range that we're going

998
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
to be referring to I'm actually going to

999
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,240
distinguish the two

1000
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,540
okay so we have that one month's candle

1001
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,540
range defined

1002
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,400
and we're going to go back to on the

1003
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,060
monthly level where are our monthly

1004
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,880
premium arrays well you have a breaker

1005
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,260
here

1006
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,000
so we frame that so there's a move that

1007
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,700
we can look up to for a monthly level so

1008
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,839
we have both our monthly discount and

1009
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:54,560
premium arrays

1010
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,520
this is our monthly range

1011
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,740
this is our

1012
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,440
range for trading the monthly range in

1013
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,380
other words what's our probable range of

1014
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,619
probability or profitability where would

1015
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,540
we expect to see moves take place

1016
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,460
we take that range and we apply it to a

1017
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,800
weekly chart and refine that down into

1018
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
this individual weekly

1019
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,460
PD arrays in terms of a premium array so

1020
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,960
we have here weekly premium arrays

1021
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,339
outlined I didn't put every single one

1022
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,480
of them on here just to keep the chart

1023
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,160
clean so that way we can go through and

1024
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,280
have many examples for your study go

1025
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,599
through and find out where all the other

1026
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,579
ones are okay go through the individual

1027
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,160
weekly chart and monthly chart and you

1028
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,079
can see how price had respected a lot of

1029
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,700
the other ones too that aren't being

1030
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,260
used here if I just gave you the obvious

1031
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,200
ones I use rejection blocks here for

1032
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,420
weekly and premium arrays

1033
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,760
so when price broke away from that 104

1034
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,920
35 level and started expanding reaching

1035
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,839
up into that 1860 level

1036
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,540
that Weekly premium array

1037
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,320
it had three lesser lower weekly premium

1038
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,540
arrays old lows

1039
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,940
seen through 2014 going into 2015

1040
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,800
and then we saw

1041
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,940
rejection block around the 111 level

1042
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,920
then we saw another rejection block

1043
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,880
around the 106 Big figure as noted here

1044
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,800
so they're all objectives are where

1045
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,380
price should reach up to so if you look

1046
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,940
at that it's still a great deal of

1047
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,000
opportunity between just those four

1048
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,099
premium arrays on a weekly chart

1049
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,440
dropping down into a daily chart

1050
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,780
you can see a little bit more detail and

1051
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,260
how price had reached from the 104.35 up

1052
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,579
to each one of those weekly premium

1053
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,140
arrays

1054
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,520
all being

1055
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,079
catalysts for higher prices

1056
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,320
now we got into a four hour chart we can

1057
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,260
start applying all of the order block

1058
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,680
Theory and rejection block Theory

1059
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,380
and we're also incorporating now the day

1060
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,700
of week

1061
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,859
filter which is Monday Tuesday Wednesday

1062
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,140
so I've shaded where every Monday

1063
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,200
Tuesday and Wednesday's range is

1064
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,260
and I'm also highlighting order blocks

1065
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,540
for bullish buy and I'm also

1066
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,760
highlighting mitigation

1067
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,420
and also highlighting rejection blocks

1068
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,359
all of these are discount

1069
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,420
arrays and the red shaded area up is a

1070
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,800
118

1071
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
70 level or thereabouts that's the

1072
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,480
premium array on a weekly basis that

1073
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,859
we're reaching for

1074
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,320
so how many buying opportunities did you

1075
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,680
see here

1076
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,420
six

1077
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,180
one each week

1078
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,140
let's break it down a little bit more

1079
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,160
detail

1080
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,920
again taking all the unnecessary things

1081
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,599
off the chart and you can see how price

1082
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,079
has moved rather uniformly and

1083
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,960
systematic each new week giving you

1084
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,800
buying opportunities

1085
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,599
and I will add all the individual day

1086
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,520
dividers and I want you to take a look

1087
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,839
at something

1088
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:19,020
as the weekly ranges defined by the

1089
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,420
double line vertical dashed lines okay

1090
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,540
that delineates the Sundays so

1091
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,920
everything to the right of those double

1092
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,780
vertical lines

1093
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,520
that are dashed that represents a

1094
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
Sunday's Trading

1095
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
to the right of it you have Monday

1096
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,140
Tuesday and Wednesday shaded

1097
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,859
notice how the lows of the week are

1098
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,720
generally formed in Monday Tuesday and

1099
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,000
Wednesday in this context

1100
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
also notice

1101
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,099
that when you see the high that's formed

1102
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,780
between Monday and Wednesday say for

1103
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,460
instance that there's a high that forms

1104
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,440
uh during the Monday through Wednesday

1105
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,560
range when that high is taken out intra

1106
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,640
week

1107
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
this is significant

1108
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,300
because price will tend to expand

1109
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,339
aggressively towards the monthly and or

1110
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,319
weekly premium array

1111
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,660
and it's reversed if it's bearish so

1112
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,800
what we're doing is we're looking for

1113
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
the Monday through Wednesday range every

1114
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,520
single week

1115
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,160
when that is bullish underlying in the

1116
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,440
market and if you break that range

1117
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,079
that's defined by technically Sunday's

1118
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,300
opening but just for the sake of keeping

1119
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,160
things germane and and consistent

1120
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,359
because I did mention how we didn't

1121
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,700
really refer to Sundays anymore

1122
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,220
you can use Sunday for completeness sake

1123
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,980
but from a Monday's opening

1124
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,380
to Tuesday and Wednesday's range

1125
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,900
whatever the highest high is when months

1126
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,119
when when the markets are bullish if

1127
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,740
that high is broken intra week say for

1128
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,380
instance on Thursday or uh you know

1129
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,020
Friday generally that is indicative of

1130
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,359
an aggressive confirmation that we're

1131
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,400
going to be moving to our premium array

1132
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,020
that we were looking for or identified

1133
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,300
ahead of time and everything you see

1134
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,400
here would just be reversed for bearish

1135
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,680
markets

1136
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,619
Monday through Wednesday's range if that

1137
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,880
is broken

1138
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,160
when it's bullish the high that's formed

1139
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,380
between Monday and Wednesday that is a

1140
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,880
confirmation that you are in a buy

1141
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,339
program and the markets will expand

1142
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,260
aggressively to reach for your higher

1143
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,000
level premium array

1144
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,339
when the markets are bearish

1145
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,140
the low that's formed between Monday

1146
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,540
through Wednesday if that is broken on

1147
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,339
an intra-week basis

1148
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,500
that is confirmation that you are an

1149
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,140
aggressive sell-off or sell program and

1150
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,700
your long-term higher time frame

1151
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,680
discount or rate that you're aiming for

1152
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,480
it's a high probability condition that's

1153
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,460
going to reach for that may not happen

1154
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,720
that week but you're going to keep

1155
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,280
looking for the next week to be bullish

1156
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,960
or bearish respectively based on that

1157
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,220
information

1158
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,900
so hopefully you found this teaching

1159
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,160
insightful we're going to be building on

1160
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,960
a lot of these ideas in a lot more

1161
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,940
detail leading into the ultimate

1162
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,040
delivery of one shot one kill in a

1163
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,800
process oriented rule-based breakdown

1164
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,480
what you do from the beginning to end to

1165
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,000
execution and until next session I wish

1166
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,839
good luck good Trading
