1
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,080
welcome to lesson seven folks of the

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,900
short-term trading module for ICT

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,820
mentorship

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,980
this teaching is dealing with intra-week

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,080
reversals and overlapping models

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,199
okay obviously in every one of our

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,480
teachings we have to remind you that

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,000
we're working with time and price

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,540
and one of the questions I want to lead

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,059
in this teaching with is

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,940
obviously I've shared with you specific

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,700
weekly profiles and when I was teaching

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,379
for free

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,079
I taught that there were Market reversal

15
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,739
profiles intra week and Inter day

16
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,600
and we'll talk about intraday when we

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,960
get into day trading but for short-term

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,059
trading there's intra-week Market

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,879
reversal profiles that

20
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,100
for the uninitiated or the uninformed

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,140
there are many times caught off guard by

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,020
the likelihood of a potential reversal

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,500
and early on in my career I had these

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,720
events as well and it plagued me it was

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,799
one of those things that just kept

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,900
coming up all the time I'd have a trade

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,299
it was profitable it would be working

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,700
for me and then something would happen

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,619
midweek and it would completely reverse

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,960
and I would hope and pray that it would

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
get back in sync with what I was

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,700
expecting to see as a long-term trade

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,200
and

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
it didn't happen it came back and rolled

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,880
right up against me and either stopped

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,880
me out or pressured me so much that I

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,400
had to get out of the trade

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,399
if you've never experienced this

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
you will eventually

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,860
so it's important we cover it now one of

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,079
the hardest things for me to teach when

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,659
it comes to Market profiling is the

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,579
market reversal profile

44
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,119
because I have to teach

45
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,940
not just one element of trading or

46
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,979
discipline of trading but I have to

47
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,879
teach a multiple approach either swing

48
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,500
trading short-term trading day trading

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,840
or position trading swing trading and

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,700
short-term trading something to that

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,540
effect so it can't be

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,660
understood as efficiently as it would be

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,900
as if the student or the trader was well

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,700
versed in more than one trading

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,940
discipline so when I was teaching on the

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,459
forums years ago and I was sharing my

57
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,959
information on YouTube and on my own

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,220
website uh the problem I was well aware

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,280
of but I wanted to kind of like lay some

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,739
foundations to the folks that were

61
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,780
really involved in learning and studying

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,879
they could have

63
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,459
not get to the what I'm going to share

64
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,560
here but you know come to the conclusion

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,620
that there are certain guidelines and

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,720
approaches that leads to

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,360
a potential intra-week Market reversal

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
profile

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
and we're going to cover the components

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,180
that leads to that in this teaching here

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,379
okay in our example again we're going to

72
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,300
be using the British pound

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,360
and this time

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,420
by having RPD arrays again

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,500
okay

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,620
I want you to focus on this low right

77
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,060
here

78
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,640
this actually happened the week of this

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,099
recording and it created what we're

80
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,120
going to be talking about in this

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,620
teaching

82
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,980
I was kind of waiting for this uh

83
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,019
week to close anyway so I can actually

84
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,120
use this as an example

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,159
but if you go through the notes in this

86
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,420
teaching you'll be able to go back over

87
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,519
historical data and see where they

88
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,220
manifest themselves and the criteria I

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,280
teach in this lesson you'll see that a

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,980
just like script it follows it almost to

91
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,640
the to the letter

92
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,780
so what we're looking at is the low that

93
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,280
was formed on cable

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
and the intra-week reversal and what led

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,019
up to that and what are the

96
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,879
characteristics that generally are a

97
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,540
part of this phenomena

98
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,339
first we have to identify the fact that

99
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,279
the market was in a premium Market

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,160
classified by the large trading range

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,080
that we talked about and outlined in

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,460
lesson five

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,860
so we're in the premium range of the

104
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
pdra Matrix and perhaps you saw that the

105
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,360
market was trading up into the weekly

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,460
rejection block or traded up into Old

107
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,500
bearish order block on The Daily charts

108
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,479
therefore we could potentially see the

109
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,220
market trade lower as we were

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,560
anticipating potentially seeing this

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,440
week but it trades down into a lower

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,800
level PD array in the discount it

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
doesn't do it over the course of the

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,419
entire week no no it does this in a

115
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,580
matter of 24 hours

116
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,780
so

117
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,419
as the market in this case the cable

118
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,460
British pound USD

119
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,479
trades over 200 points

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,699
in a period of 24 hours the market

121
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,699
reaches for a level with speed for a

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,320
particular reason

123
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,880
and when you look at the daily chart

124
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,940
here we've outlined the PD arrays and

125
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,380
you can see that there's a daily bullish

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,540
order block mean threshold

127
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,919
and

128
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,080
price reaches right into that

129
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,300
on Wednesday of the week of this

130
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,580
recording

131
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,780
when we see a fast Market

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,820
we have to immediately assume that

133
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,860
they're reaching for a level

134
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,100
institutional order flow that is highly

135
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,800
critical for efficiency on the interbank

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,580
level

137
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,340
now that may be in the form of Commerce

138
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,820
globally or it could be in the form of a

139
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,860
repricing at the Central Bank level

140
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,620
either one of those could happen

141
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,800
rather quickly and while it took some

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
time to gradually drift down over the

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,780
24-hour time period for that whole

144
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,020
entire range to form between

145
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,120
Tuesday going into Wednesday's low

146
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,680
the idea is

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,900
you're going to anticipate at the

148
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,120
beginning of the week a certain outcome

149
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,060
and it's prudent that you stick to that

150
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,300
okay because over the course of a career

151
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,280
you're going to get caught in a reversal

152
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,919
like this once in a while it's not going

153
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,539
to plague your career obviously after

154
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,919
learning what's being taught in this

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
lesson but you also have a checklist on

156
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,940
things that may lead to that type of

157
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,180
scenario and if you go back over to the

158
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,280
Chart index and look at some of the

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,539
examples we were talking about as it

160
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,100
relates to the cable

161
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,580
there were telltale signs and I gave you

162
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,860
a little marker telling you that there's

163
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,340
a potential area of Bounce likely in

164
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,479
this pair

165
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,580
what led me to that are the things that

166
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm going to teach you in this lesson

167
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
because I understand multiple dimensions

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,300
of trading whether it be position

169
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,340
trading short-term trading swing trading

170
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,979
day trading scalping all that business

171
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,319
I am versed in understanding and reading

172
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,600
price

173
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,539
universally it's not one type of time

174
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,880
frame to me that makes sense it's all

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,199
the time frames I know how to blend them

176
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,280
together

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,400
that part comes with experience and

178
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,220
after a measurable growth in your

179
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,460
experience and working within different

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,259
disciplines of trading this is the

181
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,300
reason why I tell you regardless of

182
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,340
whatever you think you want to be at the

183
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,319
beginning of the mentorship it's going

184
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,780
to graduate into other things

185
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,300
but I'm forcing you across all of them

186
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,860
if you're willing to submit to all of

187
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,539
them and stay with the mentorship

188
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,460
again it's not a plug you decide whether

189
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,680
you're staying here or not but by having

190
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,919
a well-versed approach and understanding

191
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,139
across all the disciplines you

192
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,080
inherently have a advantage over those

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,759
individuals that just stick to just one

194
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,979
format or discipline or trading I'm a

195
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,479
scalper I'm only going to worry about

196
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,340
scalping okay well then you're not going

197
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,560
to be that good at scalping because you

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,900
have a limited myopic view on price

199
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,099
action so having a well-rounded approach

200
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,379
to price action what multiple time

201
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,919
frames different disciplines you will by

202
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,520
default be a better Trader at whatever

203
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,020
discipline you focus on as a career

204
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,740
so we're going to look at this little

205
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,299
range in here

206
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,159
that's not so much of a little range but

207
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,140
we're gonna look at the move in this

208
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,839
particular decline down into the daily

209
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,360
bullish order block mean threshold and

210
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,039
what what the Catalyst that led to that

211
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,580
reversal

212
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,140
first thing you want to notice is that

213
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,519
price is unwilling to leave the premium

214
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,080
so we're in the upper portion of the

215
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
larger trading range defined by in

216
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
lesson five

217
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,540
so while we saw initially in the

218
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,980
beginning of the week the market want to

219
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,899
decline and it was doing it aggressively

220
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,260
and speedily if you will by seeing that

221
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,600
we could have if we didn't understand PD

222
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,019
array Matrix discount arrays we could

223
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,420
have easily expected this Market to keep

224
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,980
on trading lower maybe even going down

225
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,140
to the fair value Gap or if you're a

226
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,060
classic support resistance person maybe

227
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,040
just that old low made back in January

228
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,000
myopic I know but nonetheless this View

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,140
leads to what many times breaks accounts

230
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,720
and careers it dashes the hopes of

231
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,940
would-be Traders because they aren't

232
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,399
informed you're learning the mechanics

233
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,920
of how price is delivered we're going to

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,839
look at this range here and Define it in

235
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,540
a context that would otherwise not be

236
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,820
available to you

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,680
so we'll look at the first

238
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,300
two days of the week

239
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,680
going into Wednesday's low

240
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,779
and I want you to understand just how

241
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,720
much that price range is it's

242
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,120
extraordinary it look at the the length

243
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,220
of that candle

244
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,920
for the most part it's many times larger

245
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,080
than the general average of all the

246
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,820
candles here

247
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,500
now obviously there's a few of them here

248
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,680
that are larger but in general terms the

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,839
candles slightly before and the candles

250
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,060
to the right of it that large down

251
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,180
candle on Tuesday

252
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,800
it's

253
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,540
pretty much a dominating candle

254
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,580
so it was speed at which it moved in one

255
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,120
trading day to get down to a specific

256
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,160
institutional order flow reference point

257
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,019
we're going to take a closer look at

258
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,760
this and we're going to look at a four

259
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,740
hour chart and we're going to refine it

260
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,959
and give it a little bit more detail

261
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,820
the yellow area is that same range

262
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,420
defined across the entire week

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,640
from when these rallied Tuesday's

264
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,579
decline in the Wednesday's low

265
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,519
and price returns to a discount pdra

266
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,459
reversing enter week now we we can see

267
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,140
it clearly here it's hindsight it's

268
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,899
perfect it's 2020. we can see it but we

269
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,760
have to go into it with the details

270
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,860
because that's what's going to help you

271
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,500
see what it looks like going forward why

272
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,779
did we anticipate a bounce there why did

273
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,040
I give it to you in your chart Index

274
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
this week the things I'm going to show

275
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,220
you here

276
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,600
I want you to take a look at the low

277
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,740
here and it forms on Wednesdays

278
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Market low and it's trading at a daily

279
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,480
bullish order block mean threshold

280
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,959
after the bounce at the daily bullish

281
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,220
order block mean threshold

282
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,060
ipta draws price up into a four hour

283
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,360
bearish order block premium PD array

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,640
notice the efficiency how it trades

285
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,579
right up into it it's exactly right to

286
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,620
The Logical area where price should

287
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,200
reach for if it's going to a premium

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Market

289
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,700
there's very little movement below the

290
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,079
level that's identified as the daily

291
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,060
bullish order block mean threshold and

292
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,880
it trades right to the four hour bearish

293
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,220
order block you can't get any better

294
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,660
than that in terms of price delivery

295
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,060
clearly seen with the four hour order

296
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,959
block traded here

297
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,399
so now we're going to take it and refine

298
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,019
it down to an hourly chart and give it a

299
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,440
lot more flesh on the skeleton we're

300
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,320
outlining as a market reversal profile

301
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
I want you to note the large decline

302
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,860
from the first of the week now obviously

303
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,779
I'm I'm beating this in your head

304
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,880
because this is the classic Telltale

305
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,040
sign that you have a potential Market

306
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,800
reversal profile think about it every

307
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,540
time that the market quickly starts

308
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,000
trading on Monday or Tuesday

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,459
aggressively and speedily that's usually

310
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,040
a Telltale sign it's in a hurry to make

311
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,940
a weekly range or it's going to go to an

312
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
Institutional order flow reference point

313
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,079
that could potentially cause it to

314
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,220
reverse and go the other way

315
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,980
so now we can see Monday starts as a

316
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,440
potential high of the week profile

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
rallies initially right from Sunday's

318
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,100
opening declines a little bit and then

319
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,839
we have another rally into the London

320
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,060
session on Tuesday and it aggressively

321
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,420
trades lower trading rate into the

322
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,860
changeover from Tuesday into Wednesday

323
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,440
creating the low of the week and then we

324
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,600
have an aggressive move off that low

325
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,760
this

326
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,700
right here this price decline the speed

327
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,700
at which and the magnitude of which it

328
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,399
moves is The Telltale sign that's the

329
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
characteristic that leads you to okay

330
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,320
we're really moving quickly and we're

331
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,700
covering a lot of ground in the

332
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,899
beginning of the week

333
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,200
whenever that happens you immediately

334
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
start looking for higher time frame PD

335
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,540
arrays that may cut cause or be a

336
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,060
catalyst for intra-week Market reversal

337
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,620
profile

338
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,079
if you do not do this and you fall into

339
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,399
the the thought process that okay

340
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,740
it's moving quickly it's moving fast so

341
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,000
therefore I'm going to make a lot more

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,120
money in double time and it's probably

343
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,220
going to have an equal leg you know

344
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,079
lower later in the week in the same mood

345
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,060
no don't think like that okay don't

346
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,440
think like that at all

347
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,120
speed in price is indicative

348
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,199
of them getting to a valuation point

349
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,779
when price is in a hurry to get

350
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,940
somewhere think about when central banks

351
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,860
reprice for instance when they do

352
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,260
interest rate announcements okay there's

353
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,600
very little time from where right before

354
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,920
the announcement

355
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,139
then the news comes out and then the the

356
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,940
rate changes

357
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,160
that is not attributed to buying and

358
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,860
selling okay that's a repricing based at

359
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,959
the Central Bank level it's a sudden

360
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,420
thing and that's why there's such a wide

361
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,459
disparity between where price is at one

362
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,720
moment then all of a sudden it's

363
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
somewhere else

364
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,199
that repricing

365
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,839
is a

366
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,480
response to a central bank intervention

367
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
or interest rate announcement

368
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,980
when there is no Central Bank

369
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,959
involvement and price is just

370
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,540
aggressively and speedily moving okay

371
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,639
that's based on evaluation through

372
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,100
speculation so they're taking the market

373
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,360
down through ipta in this case down to a

374
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,300
daily premium

375
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
to Discount range in other words it's

376
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,120
moving away from a premium down into a

377
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,160
discount PD array

378
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,639
but we're still in the larger premium

379
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,620
range so if you were just looking at

380
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,240
price and you understood or what were

381
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,880
sold this would look like it's probably

382
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,860
going to keep going lower it's going to

383
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,139
continue going lower but no the only

384
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,579
thing it's doing is it's showing and

385
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,019
willingness to get back down to a

386
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,420
discount level okay think about how I

387
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,220
showed you in the previous lesson how

388
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,800
you can grade

389
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,899
modular smaller ranges in terms of

390
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,360
premium and discount arrays

391
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,600
that same thing is being used here but

392
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,120
just in scope of keeping it in the upper

393
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
portion of the premium range on that

394
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,860
daily chart that we've broken down in

395
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,240
lesson five

396
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
so while we're still overall in a

397
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,579
premium Market longer term

398
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,220
short term it can continuously move

399
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,560
higher and keep making higher highs

400
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,300
think about it like when you trade with

401
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,339
bearish Divergence just because the

402
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,199
momentum indicator is diverging barracy

403
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,519
doesn't mean price is going to say okay

404
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,480
well I'm going to turn around go the

405
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,040
other way because the stochastics are

406
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,860
macd it continuously can keep moving

407
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,680
higher up that same element takes place

408
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,180
when we're looking at just price action

409
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,459
alone so while we are in a premium

410
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,079
Market the market is showing a

411
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,140
willingness to not here's the key not

412
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,959
move out of a premium Market in other

413
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,819
words why didn't this continuously go

414
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,500
lower Wednesday into Thursday going into

415
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,020
the discount Market because it needs to

416
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,660
go higher it wants to go higher so if

417
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,579
it's not going to go lower and it wants

418
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,619
to go higher where do we focus we focus

419
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,779
on premium PD arrays

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,220
now Wednesday breaks a short-term high

421
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,100
and then we start seeing evidences of

422
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,380
institutional sponsorship on every

423
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,220
bullish order block

424
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,340
every order block that forms with the

425
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,080
down candle or a series of Down Candles

426
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
we extend it out in time you can see

427
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,000
them capitalizing each one of them with

428
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,640
new long positions and we're seeing a

429
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,679
positive confirmation because prices

430
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,880
quickly surging away from that level

431
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,700
every instance we see new evidences of

432
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,860
institutional sponsorship

433
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,580
and up into a fair value Gap premium PD

434
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,880
array

435
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,580
now intra-week reversals

436
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,220
will many times look to return to the

437
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,679
previous balanced price range or

438
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,400
exceeded now what does that mean

439
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
think about the market maker cell and

440
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,059
buy profiles okay or Market maker cell

441
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,100
and buy

442
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,700
models in this case here this could end

443
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,539
up becoming a market maker by profile

444
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,780
we have the consolidation known as in

445
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,700
this example as the price balance range

446
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,679
or it's price is in a small little range

447
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,200
and then it leaves it on Tuesday

448
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,280
aggressively sells off

449
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,160
we have the smart money reversal into

450
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,220
Tuesdays Wednesday overlap

451
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,340
then we have a low risk Buy

452
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,160
on Thursday then we have a continuation

453
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,700
for reaccumulation on Friday but prices

454
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,360
traded up into that price balance range

455
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
all over again it's right back up and

456
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,559
again so when we see that this could be

457
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,080
the end of the move it can be this could

458
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,179
all that's been necessary is for them to

459
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,039
trade right back up that price balanced

460
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,000
range

461
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but we always have to have the

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,280
likelihood on our mind that price May

463
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,559
exceed it and go past it which is what

464
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,520
the market maker buy profile really aims

465
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,140
to do it take out the liquidity above

466
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,960
and on high in this case we have a lower

467
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,500
high formed on Tuesday than Monday so it

468
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,600
may not necessarily need to go above it

469
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,220
but personally between you and I I think

470
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,520
it will

471
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,419
so here we have a British pound naked

472
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,340
one-hour chart

473
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,919
now if we were just given this example

474
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,780
here in price action maybe some of us

475
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,280
would be able to see that low down there

476
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,980
and see some evidence to support why it

477
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,360
should go up

478
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,320
and then maybe not

479
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,260
whenever we have a storyline or a

480
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,840
potential outcome in the marketplace in

481
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,600
our mind that we we formed an opinion we

482
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,980
have a plan that we're going to try to

483
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,780
execute on

484
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,760
it's important that we we're mindful

485
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,980
that the setup may not pan out for

486
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,660
instance the beginning of this week you

487
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,580
may have seen this as a potential high

488
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,320
of the week and you expected to see

489
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,780
Friday's close be lower than Wednesday's

490
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,340
low

491
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,160
guess what just like I do sometimes

492
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,960
you're gonna get it wrong

493
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,780
the evidences of the fact that the

494
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,700
Market's moving quickly at the beginning

495
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,140
of the week this is Monday and Tuesday

496
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,980
Monday and Tuesday okay or one of the

497
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,059
two if we see sudden quick movement in

498
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,400
price and magnitude here's the key word

499
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,620
here it's got to cover a lot of distance

500
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,679
what's average uh average distance of

501
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,740
the last few days if it exceeds it a lot

502
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,660
whatever the average daily range is for

503
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
the last five days if it gets well above

504
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,840
it

505
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,760
chances are you're probably going to see

506
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,559
a market reversal profile it doesn't

507
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,299
mean it always will happen it just means

508
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,880
that start considering it okay I

509
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
mentioned in the commentary through this

510
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,799
week that we were probably going to see

511
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,520
the weekly range form in one day and we

512
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,740
did we pretty much ended up seeing that

513
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,299
with the exception of a small little

514
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,000
tail noted here on Monday's high uh the

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,160
whole range for cable was really formed

516
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,760
on Tuesday so

517
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,820
that's indicative it's characteristic of

518
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,000
a market reversal profile intra week

519
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,100
so the main thing I want you to

520
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,740
understand in this lesson is that at the

521
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,179
beginning of the week we anticipate the

522
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,580
higher low the form period that's that's

523
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,740
a given that that's that's the nature of

524
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,740
ICT Concepts because as

525
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,679
humans were generally good starters and

526
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,740
the week starts with the new hopes and

527
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,260
aspirations to make money in exchange

528
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,720
and commerce but

529
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,820
opinions can change

530
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,000
directives can be changed and the

531
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,039
central bank and the banks themselves

532
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,179
they can make policy changes and or

533
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:13,140
fundamentals may change that we're not

534
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,080
aware of and yes you heard that right I

535
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,299
don't know what they are that causes

536
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,740
price to change at the Central Bank

537
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,600
level I don't need to know it I can see

538
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,059
the evidences of it in price so

539
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,039
when we move forward and going through

540
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,020
price action study it's important that

541
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,820
you understand that knowing the higher

542
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,100
time frame PD arrays will Aid in

543
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,960
failures that means when you have a

544
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,159
trade that doesn't seem like it's

545
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,480
working out for you even though you're

546
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
profitable chances are it's probably

547
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,740
better for you to get out of it and look

548
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,780
for another entry point

549
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,400
if it doesn't give you a strong entry

550
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,659
point chances are it's probably going to

551
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,799
be a market reversal profile

552
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,520
Wednesday or Thursday reversals

553
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,640
generally form every month so no matter

554
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,440
what pair you're looking at there's

555
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,559
generally some kind of a a reversal of

556
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,080
sorts that can form so by going over

557
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,720
examples and looking at Price hit

558
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,820
you'll see many more examples in just

559
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,740
this one here and everything we're

560
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,980
showing is reversed when there's an

561
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,140
intra week Market reversal profile that

562
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,539
goes higher and then sells off

563
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,980
so

564
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,620
it's a generic concept it's very simple

565
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,720
things that leads up to it the classic

566
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,480
telltale signs are the magnitude at

567
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,919
which the price moves on Monday and

568
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,020
Tuesday okay so it's only two days you

569
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,179
have to focus on how much is price

570
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,159
moving on Monday and Tuesday

571
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,320
so if you're seeing a lot of movement in

572
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,480
your favor and it's really covering a

573
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,740
lot of distance and it's doing it

574
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,720
quickly many instances you're going to

575
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
see it like this week really built in on

576
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,760
one trading day when it does that

577
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,340
consider the higher time frame PDA race

578
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,140
because it's probably going down to

579
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,020
evaluation or a higher level valuation

580
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,600
point and then it's going to have a lot

581
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,880
of sponsorship come in and then those

582
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,039
flows are going to turn the market it's

583
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,900
going to turn it the other way and if

584
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
you fight that it can beat you up or

585
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,700
dare I say it break your account

586
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,559
now consider swing trading model overlap

587
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,700
possibilities

588
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,620
and we've talked about the likelihood of

589
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,539
using short-term trading Concepts in one

590
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,179
shot one kill and now we're going to

591
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,240
blend or overlap trading models so it

592
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,400
helps you kind of formulate a better

593
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,080
understanding

594
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,240
here we have that same area price action

595
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,520
and what I've done was I've outlined it

596
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,159
in terms of a premium and discount PD

597
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,539
array Matrix

598
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,460
so we can see in the green area that's

599
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,440
the discount area and I have it graded

600
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,059
as well with four grades or four

601
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,780
quadrants and the premium area is posted

602
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,280
and it's divided as well

603
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,780
notice that on the daily chart

604
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,600
we have a daily bullish order Block it's

605
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,299
trading down into that so if we look at

606
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,740
this model here think about what I

607
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,020
taught you in the swing trading model

608
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,480
this is a swing trade entry this is

609
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
exactly what you look for for a swing

610
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,559
trade now if you're not a swing Trader

611
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
if you don't think like a swing Trader

612
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,200
then you're not going to see this as a

613
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,520
swing trade entry you're not going to

614
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
see it as a potential

615
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,159
setup that could many times pay out much

616
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,980
more than what a one shot one kill would

617
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,600
if you're only focusing on I'm going to

618
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,740
be a short-term Trader or I'm going to

619
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,000
only be a day trader I'm only going to

620
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,760
be a scalper these types of setups will

621
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,520
evade you and by evading you it's also

622
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,980
going to become a pitfall for you you're

623
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,840
not going to know when there's going to

624
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,580
be these potential reversals they'll get

625
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,480
you'll get caught off guard

626
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,440
so now we're going to take that same

627
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,240
element everything we saw in the daily

628
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,059
chart that is just applied we're just re

629
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,000
viewing it from a one-hour standpoint so

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,240
we can see the intraday price action on

631
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,460
a day by day division

632
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,700
you can see here reversals intra week

633
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,059
they occur here's the secret they occur

634
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,179
in overlapping models

635
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,640
every Market reversal that happens enter

636
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,720
week will be a overlapping of two types

637
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,700
of trading disciplines they'll be at

638
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,200
odds with one another

639
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,820
here's the rub

640
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,340
the higher time frame discipline will

641
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,480
always win

642
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,520
that's why we have to focus on monthly

643
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,360
weekly and daily PD arrays that's why I

644
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,919
beat it in your head that they are the

645
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,380
most important ones anything less than

646
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,299
that four hour that's about as low as

647
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,919
you want to go anything less than that

648
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,380
is all day trading stuff and if their

649
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,120
day trading things are not in alignment

650
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,640
with a higher time frame daily weekly or

651
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,700
monthly no less than a four hour you're

652
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
really not trading high probability

653
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,400
setups

654
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,960
so it's important that you understand

655
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,700
that the reversals

656
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,020
are not

657
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,299
always going to surprise you now because

658
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,799
you have some characteristics to look

659
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,460
for and now by having an opinion of not

660
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,380
just one shot one kill short-term

661
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,059
trading or

662
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,679
swing trading but you have position

663
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,960
trading as well and by blending all

664
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,700
those elements together it gives you a

665
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,960
greater understanding about price action

666
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
and now because you have these

667
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,700
characteristics in each discipline

668
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,020
understood

669
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,580
when you see a opposing view if a swing

670
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,520
Trader's approach saying it's a buy when

671
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,020
you're looking at a One-Shot one kill

672
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,080
sell-off

673
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,480
chances are your weekly range phenomenon

674
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,100
that you're trying to trade is going to

675
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,779
have opposition to the degree where it

676
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,240
will cause a reversal as it's being

677
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,840
shown here

678
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,539
so daily Swing model overlap example

679
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,600
shown here will hopefully ground you in

680
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
your understanding about how intra-week

681
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,860
Market reversals occur

682
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,500
takeaways from this lesson again are

683
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,659
the speed at which price moves on Monday

684
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,299
and Tuesday the magnitude at which it

685
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,620
moves there's your number one

686
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,179
characteristic Telltale sign you're

687
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,559
probably going to see a market reversal

688
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,080
and your week

689
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,360
and look for overlapping opposing

690
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,940
trading models if one is suggesting a

691
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,799
Buy on a higher time frame while in a

692
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,480
lower time frame it's looking like it

693
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,700
may continue going lower the arm

694
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,960
wrestling match is always going to be

695
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,820
won by the higher time frame

696
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,860
so hopefully you've learned something

697
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,500
that brings you closer to a greater

698
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
understanding of price action and

699
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,900
intra-week reversals and blending and

700
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,340
overlapping trading models
