1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,460
welcome to lesson five folks short-term

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,660
trading this teaching is going to be

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,039
specifically talking about low

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,660
resistance liquidity runs and

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,320
consolidations

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,098
okay we have to preface it by a reminder

7
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,340
of every setup that we look

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,020
to execute on

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,140
and to stalk into the track if you will

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,480
is based on time and price

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,000
and the time element is going to be

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
related to the upto data ranges

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,739
last 60 days

14
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,840
40 and 20.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,940
and we're going to be focusing on

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,360
premium and discount PD arrays

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,020
so for short-term Trading

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,440
we will excel in the range of the last

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,900
three months so the up to data range of

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,340
60 days

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,920
is our look back period

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,220
and it's going to comprise every element

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,979
that we need to frame a short-term trade

24
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,920
or one shot one kill

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
now as a reminder

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,020
when we deal with time and price you

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,900
price moves from a premium to a discount

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,900
array or from a discount array to a

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,240
premium array

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,640
in between these two Realms of premium

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
and discount

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,259
price will key off of a time element

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,960
related to the if the data range so

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
we're blending both time and price

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,799
an element of the last 20 40 and 60 days

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,280
to a institutional reference point in

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,020
the realm of the PD array Matrix

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,140
okay for our study and case study

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,038
examples we're going to be looking at

40
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,420
the cable or British pound USD

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,280
and this is a daily chart

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,580
and what we do is we Define a market

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,760
whether that it's it's trending or it's

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,640
in consolidation and obviously anyone

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,739
with the average intelligence in terms

46
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,500
of market analysis they can tell looking

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,140
at the British pound we have been in a

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,180
consolidation Mark it's not been in a

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,500
trending Mark it's been in consolidation

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,200
so whenever we see a market that's range

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,860
bound or it's cannot move outside of the

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
current trading range that you're

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
looking at

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
at any given time on a daily chart

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,080
you're looking at a frame of about three

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,459
months again you'll come back three

57
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,800
months or 60 trading days which is the

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
relative if the data range that we use

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,459
for maximum

60
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,580
definition of look back

61
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,099
so when we have this framework in terms

62
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,800
of the last 60 days what we do is we

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,099
have to define the range in terms of a

64
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,200
high and a low

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
now what we do is we Define the range in

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,099
the form of its highest and lowest

67
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,019
Candlestick body

68
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,360
we're not concerned about the Wix so

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,940
much but we're primarily looking at the

70
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,739
bodies of the candles

71
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,680
so I have here the lowest and the

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,700
highest

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,280
in terms of the candlesticks bodies and

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,019
you can see those reference points here

75
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,360
but the arrows

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,819
and that's going to be our range that

77
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,500
we're going to be framing all of our

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,599
analysis Concepts as it relates to one

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,200
shot one kill

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,659
okay so what we'll have to do is we have

81
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,340
to look at the market

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,819
in this range and we can use a tool

83
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,500
that's on every platform it's the

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,879
Fibonacci

85
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,440
so we're going to use our FIB tool to

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,900
determine the 50 of the range and we're

87
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,580
going to note that range

88
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,440
midpoint

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,560
so I'm dragging the Fib from the highest

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
body candle

91
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,980
to the lowest body candle in other words

92
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm not using the lowest Wick low in the

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,260
highest Wick High I'm looking for the

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,320
highest body on the candles either it's

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,540
an open or closed I don't care which one

96
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,860
it is but whatever highest form of high

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,080
open or close that's the one I'm looking

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,900
for in the last 60 trading days and I'm

99
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,940
looking for the lowest open or close in

100
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,740
the last 60 trading days

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,259
that gives me my defined range in terms

102
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,820
of consolidation

103
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,300
then I note the 50 level and I draw a

104
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,919
horizontal line on my daily chart

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
next we have to determine the 50 levels

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,620
of the upper and lower ranges

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,840
anything above the 50 level that's going

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,220
to be our

109
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,740
area which we look for cell scenarios

110
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,199
either by taking profit on Longs or

111
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,660
short positions and anything in the

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,940
lower portion we're looking for Longs or

113
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,680
covering short positions

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,639
now the upper portion of the range

115
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,360
from the highest body close or open to

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,340
the midpoint that we Define by the total

117
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,139
consolidation range

118
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,780
we measure that with the FIB as well and

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,100
I gave you two examples of where you

120
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,479
could draw the anchor points with your

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,440
FIB with the arrows

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,600
and you note the 50 level on your fib

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,280
and you drop a horizontal line there

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,900
by noting this we've now noted the upper

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,280
range

126
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,080
for the total consolidation range

127
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,479
next

128
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
we do the same thing by noting the 50

129
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,400
level of the lower range between the

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,960
midpoint of the total consolidation

131
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,759
range to the lowest body close or open

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,000
noting it's 50 level as well on the FIB

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,220
and I drop a horizontal line on that

134
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,160
now what we have here is by defining our

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,400
consolidation range in this manner it

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,259
gives us a form of

137
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,560
premium and discount identification

138
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,100
anything above the midpoint or mean 50

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,620
level or in this case the gray

140
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,740
that would be deemed as a premium range

141
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,780
and anything below it would be deemed as

142
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,740
a discount range

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,319
next we identify the PD arrays in each

144
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,840
new range now I'm going to save this a

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
lot of time and just apply everything

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
from a monthly

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,419
a weekly and daily

148
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,340
okay so now you can see all of the if

149
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,680
the data ranges and from a form of a

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,780
premium and discount have been applied

151
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,400
to the chart

152
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,139
now I want you to look at this for a

153
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,759
moment before we go to the next slide so

154
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,860
pause the video here and really study

155
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,759
what's been identified

156
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,800
so every premium and discount array

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,860
provides setups in the overall PD array

158
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,120
Matrix

159
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,520
so what we're looking for is a element

160
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,039
of time and price to blend

161
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,979
a setup for a buy or a cell

162
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,720
we understand that the highest

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,900
probability trades for shorts is by

164
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,099
looking for any PD array

165
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,780
in the premium range of this

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,639
consolidation so anything above the

167
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,680
midpoint of the 50 level

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,259
or the gray level here that's going to

169
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,919
be ideal cell scenarios if it is coupled

170
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,919
with a PD array

171
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,139
for a premium Market

172
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,080
we are blending both time and price

173
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,599
we would look for that move to be

174
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,979
correlated to a later discount PD array

175
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,919
when price moves that down to either the

176
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,680
50 level of the total consolidation

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
or any level below the midpoint or 50

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,360
level of the consolidation

179
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,419
an example would be the fair value Gap

180
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,219
and bearish Order block

181
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,700
in the premium level

182
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,919
around the

183
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,458
February time period of 2017.

184
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,700
and pairing that with a weekly bullish

185
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
order blocking threshold

186
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,380
in a discount

187
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,600
in March of 2017.

188
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,160
now when we look at their quadrants like

189
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,959
this where it's been broken up into a

190
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,360
premium and discount

191
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,480
we can also further Define those

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,620
quadrants

193
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,740
into their own respective or unique

194
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,959
premium and discount trading range

195
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,000
and what do I mean by that well let's

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,959
take a closer look

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,440
as you can see here the lower quadrant

198
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,720
can be divided into

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,360
equal halves as well and that in itself

200
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,700
can be viewed from a premium and

201
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,720
discount

202
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,320
format

203
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
when we see these elements here anything

204
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,260
that forms as a discount PD array in a

205
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,200
discount range from this view or

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,720
perspective this is going to be high

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,440
probability short covering objectives or

208
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
it's going to be high probability new

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,980
long positions and any first profit

210
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,980
would be best taken on a loan once it

211
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,080
enters the premium

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,200
range of this uh PD array Matrix

213
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,380
again moving up the same thing can be

214
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,320
applied to the new quadrants that's

215
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,459
shown here

216
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,980
ideal Longs are entered at the discount

217
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,540
level

218
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,600
or in that discount range

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,320
and taking first profit would have to be

220
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
best applied by taking your uh first

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
long exit in the premium

222
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,779
range of this PD array Matrix

223
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,500
now what you're looking at is a daily

224
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,160
chart so in the form of a four hour or

225
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,380
one hour you'll see that there's going

226
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,640
to be

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,880
premium PD arrays in those lower four

228
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
hour and one hour time frames that you

229
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,959
could pair up first objectives for

230
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,360
targets I'm giving you the elements to

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,220
look at through the scope of a daily

232
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,519
chart

233
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,180
and I'm finally we can apply it to this

234
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,920
area as well each

235
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,980
path is further divided into new halves

236
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,079
but we're looking at it in the form of

237
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,480
an algorithmic way of defining premium

238
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
and discount

239
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,079
so when markets are creating discounts

240
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,079
like this again this discount range it's

241
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,180
shown here they're high probability

242
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,060
Longs and again a four hour or one hour

243
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,480
premium PD array as defined here you

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
can't see them in the daily but you

245
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
would drop down into a lower time frame

246
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,880
four hour and one hour to take first

247
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,519
profit on your Longs that you used to

248
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,279
get entries on by buying in the discount

249
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,640
area

250
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,459
now we're above the midpoint of the

251
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,320
total consolidation range

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,600
so now even though we're above it and

253
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,079
technically in a overall premium Market

254
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,000
we can still take Longs but it has to be

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,040
defined in the scope as we're showing

256
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,560
here we have the overall consolidation

257
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,620
we divide it in half then we divide

258
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,899
those halves into halves as well so we

259
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,060
have quadrants then those quadrants are

260
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,860
divided in half as well as we're showing

261
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,959
here in incremental increases moving

262
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,000
further up the overall consolidation

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,899
range

264
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,880
by buying in the discount range and

265
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,620
again taking first profit in a lower

266
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,459
four hour one hour premium range coupled

267
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,880
with a PD array that's premium based in

268
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,959
other words if we were buying for

269
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,380
instance the bullish order block mean

270
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
threshold here and a discount now

271
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,940
overall we're in a

272
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,820
premium Market but this is still

273
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,060
a possible long entry because we're in a

274
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,360
lower portion of that total

275
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
larger premium range so we still have

276
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,100
room to reach for higher premium PD

277
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,779
arrays and obviously we have rings that

278
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,720
reach for much higher objectives so

279
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,760
looking at it like this framing it what

280
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,040
would otherwise be deemed as overbought

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,139
we don't view it like that this is why

282
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,660
indicators do not work from a

283
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,300
algorithmic perspective looking at price

284
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,000
ranges like this it gives us a greater

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
definition on how we can frame entries

286
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,279
and classify them as

287
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,500
oversold or undervalued entries for

288
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,040
Longs or overvalued or overbought

289
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,040
entries for shorts

290
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,800
in this case we could take a example of

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
the daily bullish order block mean

292
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,440
threshold

293
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,480
we could be buying there and then once

294
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,519
price trades up into the premium

295
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,519
range we could look for a four hour or

296
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,200
one hour

297
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,959
premium PDA rate the couple and exit

298
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,139
with

299
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,360
and moving further up the consolidation

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,060
range we have a new

301
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,040
discount and premium

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,980
PD array Matrix and we could Define this

303
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,300
as well and what we're doing is we're

304
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,760
coupling the range as defined by premium

305
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,459
and discount with actual PD array

306
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,279
in the form of fair value gaps

307
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,440
Bears order blocks weekly rejection

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,899
blocks all those things to the left of

309
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,300
our chart we're looking back that 20 40

310
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,060
and 60 trading days for the ipta data

311
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,920
range so we're blending both time and

312
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,940
price

313
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,459
in the in the form of premium and

314
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,980
discount so we're blending

315
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,899
the elements of time and price we're

316
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,459
looking at the market in the scope of

317
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,019
overbought oversold but not in the

318
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,699
context of an indicator

319
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,920
we're looking at it algorithmically in

320
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
the scope of quadrants

321
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,660
that are broken down into premium and

322
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,920
discount

323
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,019
and by itself it doesn't mean anything

324
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,440
but when price trades down to a PD array

325
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,839
whether it be a discount

326
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,639
or a premium

327
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,579
if we trade into that element whether it

328
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,279
be a bullish order block a breaker any

329
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,199
of those things from the pdra Matrix

330
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,060
that we've taught you

331
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,760
if you're looking for a long

332
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,820
the highest probable entries for Longs

333
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,760
again are entering in the discount range

334
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,120
and coupling it with a premium range PD

335
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
array

336
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,500
it doesn't matter that we're in a

337
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,079
premium range of the overall

338
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,420
consolidation because price can move

339
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,519
back and forth and oscillate from the

340
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,980
highest portion and many times make a

341
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,360
slightly higher high and return back

342
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,920
inside of the range

343
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,560
and it can go to the lowest low move

344
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,880
outside the range a little bit and come

345
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,079
right back in the middle range as well

346
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
so we're anticipating the isolation

347
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
effect of price while it's in

348
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,480
consolidation but in that consolidation

349
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,060
there's smaller consolidations so we're

350
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,880
able to look at price in the view of

351
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,860
overbought never sold without the

352
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,199
element of indicators or relying on

353
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,300
mathematically derived number crunching

354
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,920
lines

355
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
what we're looking for is range defined

356
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,540
in the overall context of the

357
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,639
consolidation as we've had here

358
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,820
we're in a the upper half of the portion

359
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,100
of the larger consolidation and by

360
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,339
itself that would many times filter out

361
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,680
buy signals from anyone else that would

362
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,019
look for over about a result but for us

363
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,560
we can frame this with the oversold

364
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,000
condition

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,139
even in the element of a premium Market

366
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:40,019
it's a discount Market in a overall

367
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,000
premium Market that still has room to go

368
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
up that's basically in other words a

369
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,220
Layman's way of approaching a definition

370
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,259
but whatever we do in terms of Entry or

371
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,959
exits we're looking for elements to

372
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,019
frame the discount PD arrays that means

373
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,480
bullish order blocks Breakers fair value

374
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,300
gaps below us in price trading below an

375
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,160
old low to take out cell stops we're

376
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,439
using those ideas to frame long

377
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,380
positions and then taking first profits

378
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,260
at a four hour one hour basis once it

379
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
enters the premium

380
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,219
PD array Matrix range

381
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,079
and finally at the top of the larger

382
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,540
consolidation we can see that there is

383
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,400
still an opportunity where one could be

384
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
a buyer but the opportunities fall off

385
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,059
precipitously in terms of probabilities

386
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,740
and you can see now that the premium

387
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,059
array

388
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,520
area in other words for PD array Matrix

389
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,700
bare shorter blocks old highs

390
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,320
bearish Breakers bearish mitigation

391
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,620
blocks all those ideas they're going to

392
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,380
be much more influential in terms of

393
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,539
price action and you'll see much more

394
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,880
Dynamic price action from that side of

395
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,679
the spectrum and you can see that in the

396
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,880
form of the weekly rejection block

397
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,900
prices traded from in March of 2017 we

398
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,880
saw also a move away from the fair value

399
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,220
Gap and bearish Order block again and

400
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,900
it's

401
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,120
largely hinged on the fact that we are

402
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,679
in an upper portion of the overall

403
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,660
consolidation and we made it up into

404
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,160
that last smallest portion of the

405
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
premium

406
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,919
Market or premium PD array Matrix

407
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,980
the Shaded area that says premium that's

408
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,559
the highest portion or last little

409
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,020
segment of price in this consolidation

410
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,179
so anytime price reaches up into that

411
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,960
it's going to have a much more

412
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,179
impactful response in price when it

413
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,660
trades to a bearish PD array or a

414
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,480
premium PD array so we see that

415
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,679
happening with the weekly rejection

416
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
block it also took out an old high

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,900
formed in February so there's many

418
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,100
instances there where you can see why

419
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,400
price had a strong rejection also King

420
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,679
off of that last midpoint that's

421
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,660
dividing the premium and discount levels

422
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,720
noted here we had a really significant

423
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
sell-off and it trades all the way back

424
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,580
down into a daily bullish order block

425
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,140
mean threshold

426
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,960
then we had a 100 pip move that we

427
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
called for in our day-to-day meetings

428
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,480
and charts and you see the response it

429
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
trades right back up to what the daily

430
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
bearish order block and it also overlaps

431
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,580
with the premium 50 level

432
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,520
so there's a lot of things that you need

433
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,320
to be able to look at conceptually and

434
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,120
you have to do it on your own time I

435
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,980
could give you a plethora of examples

436
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,780
over and over and over again but this is

437
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,600
one teaching that I've given you enough

438
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,940
that if you break your charts down and

439
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,760
do your own study yes this is the part

440
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,039
that requires your work this takes study

441
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,559
time it takes you uh wanting to be in

442
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,419
the charts looking for it because I'm

443
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,100
not going to be there when we separate

444
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,600
you're going to have to do these things

445
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
on your own you have to find these these

446
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,380
opportunities on your own but by having

447
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,480
this element what we're doing is we're

448
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,039
looking for low resistance liquidity

449
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,280
runs from one PD array to another from a

450
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,500
discount to a premium but we're coupling

451
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,720
it with looking back over the last three

452
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
months because one shot one kill uses

453
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
and excels inside the last three months

454
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,660
of trading

455
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,120
so when we look back at the last 20 the

456
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,179
last 40 in the last 60 trading days it

457
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,580
gives us framework to say okay where is

458
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,860
the premium PD array Matrix

459
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,020
leading me to in terms of what I can

460
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,160
sell to

461
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,440
and what I can reach for for Longs the

462
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,039
couple my exits with or where are my

463
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,240
discount pdra Matrix and where are those

464
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,700
levels I can cover my shorts at and I'm

465
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,380
going to look back over the last 20 40

466
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,020
and 60 days to pair those things up

467
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm also now applying ranges in terms of

468
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,919
the

469
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,320
PD array Matrix whether it be a premium

470
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,960
or discount market so it allows me to

471
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
build context of what I'm looking for as

472
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,460
an entry and how I can look for my first

473
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,020
objective in targeting

474
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,520
now in an Ideal World the best buys are

475
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
going to be in the lower portion or

476
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,960
lower half of the overall consolidation

477
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,080
and in the lower quadrant in other words

478
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,620
the discount Matrix

479
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,780
and the highest probability trades for

480
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,360
selling short or taking long exits are

481
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,240
going to be in the premium range divided

482
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,260
by

483
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,480
the upper portion so in other words that

484
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
last quadrant that's going to be your

485
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,559
best cells the highest probability cells

486
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,140
or highest probability uh exits for

487
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,340
lungs

488
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,140
that's going to be your best scenario

489
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,700
that's where the algorithm is going to

490
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,780
reach for

491
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,720
for selling or exiting on longs

492
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
and any long position in here again you

493
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
have to take it with a grain of salt you

494
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
have to know the overall range you're in

495
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,880
because just because you see a train to

496
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,919
a down candle you have to have I

497
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,799
understand that it has a room to go up

498
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,600
and in this case you can see what the

499
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,640
daily bullish order block mean threshold

500
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,520
that 100 pip rally

501
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,000
was a response off of yes a PDA rate

502
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,620
discount

503
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,720
bull shoulder block but it trades up to

504
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,299
a daily bearish order block but it

505
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,039
trades up into that bearish order block

506
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,500
once it gets into the premium range that

507
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,100
also gives us a high probability Target

508
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,820
now yes it's one shot one kill scenario

509
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,140
and we're trying to trade the weekly

510
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,179
range but one shot one kill is not

511
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,220
defined by getting in on a Monday and

512
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,500
getting out on Friday one shot one kill

513
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,419
is a couple days of trading it's

514
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,100
short-term trading it can be as little

515
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,500
as one day and as long as a week

516
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,580
and finally when we look at the range in

517
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,400
the middle this can be

518
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
the areas of where you're going to get

519
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,360
chopped up the most because if you're

520
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,539
looking at a range incorrectly if you've

521
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,100
already defined the range and you're

522
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,679
looking at PDA rate

523
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,900
of premium and discount that have

524
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
already been traded to in order to look

525
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,200
at a down candle in a discount Market

526
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
normally

527
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,280
that may be a bullish order block but if

528
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,140
it's already been traded to the

529
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,820
likelihood of it being a bullish order

530
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,679
block with high probability falls off

531
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,960
because it's already been used we want

532
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,360
to use a

533
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,179
new PD array in a discount or premium

534
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,020
Market

535
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,480
that has not been traded to because the

536
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,700
algorithm knows price has been there

537
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,679
once before so it's going to seek new

538
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,400
liquidity and expand to allow the banks

539
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,919
to take participation in a move higher

540
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,240
or lower

541
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,159
so looking at the Rings like this as we

542
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,500
defined it if you're trading in the

543
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,840
middle of the range like this and you're

544
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,059
not strong in your directional bias or

545
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,280
where the market May reach for next in

546
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,080
other words understanding where open

547
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
float is where is the buy stops and the

548
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,860
sell stops if you're not really strong

549
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,780
with that if you're trading in this

550
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,000
range here you're going to get chopped

551
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,140
up a lot

552
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,600
over time you'll learn how to better

553
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,419
approach these specific premium discount

554
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,900
ranges but when you look at the outer

555
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,419
rim when we are just showing the

556
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,280
previous slide

557
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,140
the higher you can get up and the

558
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,940
