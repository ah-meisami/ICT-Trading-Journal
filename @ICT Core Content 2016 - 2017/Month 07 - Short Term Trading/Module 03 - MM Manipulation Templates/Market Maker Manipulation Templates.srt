1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,460
welcome back folks this is lesson three

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,460
short-term Trading

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,140
just lessons going to be teaching Market

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,580
maker manipulation templates

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,699
okay in lesson two we went over the

6
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,800
weekly profiles

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,280
how the market generally unfolds not

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,280
every single subtle Nuance of price

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,559
action is covered obviously

10
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,059
but the majority of the time you're

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,640
going to find that one of these market

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,379
profiles will

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,200
basically classify the price action

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
you've seen it'll classically Define the

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,660
weekly profile if you go through each

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,699
one of these templates

17
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,219
it'll give you basically the idea of how

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,199
the market manipulation has taken place

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,379
along with the market profile for that

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,060
week so we're going to be blending the

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,939
two ideas on why the market does what it

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,920
does in these individual weekly profiles

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,580
and applying it to a template idea so

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,560
you can almost forecast what the market

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,060
makers are going to be doing in advance

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,460
based on the conditions currently in the

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,979
market that you're Trading

28
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,619
before we get in to the details of it

29
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,340
all

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,700
every example here much like in lesson

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,320
two

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,680
all of the charts or diagrams are

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
represented in and depicted as a 60

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
Minute chart

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,680
so the perspective I'm trying to show

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,360
you is if you were to go through your

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,400
charts and open them up in a 60 Minute

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
or one hour chart basis

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,060
Monday through Friday this is generally

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,640
the theme of which you see the market

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,460
trade in

42
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,899
okay the first one we're going to cover

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,240
is classic Tuesday low of the week now

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
there's going to be a few

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,200
instances where we go through a few

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
scenarios each template and there's a

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
few that only have one or two ideas

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,979
around it but for the classic Tuesday

49
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,619
low of the week

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,780
what you've been looking for is a market

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,660
that is primarily bullish

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,580
and the market trades down on Tuesday

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,400
into a discount now this is going to be

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,620
in the form of either old monthly weekly

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,599
or daily low

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,000
to run a liquidity pool in other words

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,319
it's running out cell stops

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
Thursday end or going into Friday but

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,620
generally you want to look for the high

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,379
the form for the week by Thursday's New

61
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,000
York session

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
I can carry over into Friday a little

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,200
bit but in the general rule of thumb

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
just look for Thursday as the lines

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,040
portion of the weekly range and you're

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
looking for it to trade up into a

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,940
premium Market PD array now the key is

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,340
you're looking for a time frame lesser

69
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,140
than the discount liquidity pool that

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,640
you used to buy off of

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,400
for an example if you bought a monthly

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,019
liquidity pool

73
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,940
you're gonna be looking for a weekly or

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,239
daily premium PD array to trade up into

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,980
another scenario for the market maker

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,900
template for a classic Tuesday low of

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
the week again the market condition is

78
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,500
you're bullish

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,780
the discount Market you see the market

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,879
trade down to an old monthly weekly or

81
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,620
daily high that means the market has

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,959
already broken out above a historical

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,120
high or an old high and the market has

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,120
now come back and retested that area as

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,480
support

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,080
you'll be looking for this Market to

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,220
trade up into a premium PD array and or

88
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,819
a fib extension combination of 127 or

89
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,459
168 extensions for or a 100 percent

90
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,780
symmetrical price link or what I

91
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,840
classify as a perfect Market structure

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,140
swing

93
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,459
you're gonna be looking for it to trade

94
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,580
up to this premium Market PD array

95
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,879
and overlapping FIB in a time frame

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,840
lesser than the discount old High

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
so in other words if you're treating

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,819
at a weekly high as support

99
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,339
in the form of a discount Market you're

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,720
buying down there

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
as a support idea

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,500
if it's the weekly high that you bought

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,240
you're going to be looking for a daily

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,860
or four hour PD array and an extension

105
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,479
of either 127 or 168. or preferably a

106
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,820
perfect symmetrical price swing of 100

107
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,240
percent

108
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,220
another scenario for the classic Tuesday

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,440
low of the week

110
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,940
we'd be looking for the market to trade

111
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,620
down into a discount Market

112
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,600
and trading into a bullish order block

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,639
this could be either a monthly a weekly

114
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,199
and or daily

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,060
or any combination of an overlap of

116
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,880
those three time frames

117
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,220
it can also be a four hour

118
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,840
just for the sake of space I didn't have

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,340
that in here but you could be trading

120
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,460
that to a four hour bullish order block

121
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,060
and or this can occur as a market has

122
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,699
already been trading higher and you've

123
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,720
determined the overall price move may be

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,240
much significantly and higher than what

125
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,340
you see graphically depicted here in

126
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,840
this diagram in other words it could be

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,639
a multi-week scenario where the market

128
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,620
could trade higher for more than one

129
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,960
week so if that's the case you could be

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
seeing the trade trade down into support

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
or below shoulder block on Tuesday where

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,720
you'll see the first swing grade or it

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,699
could be happening in at the equilibrium

134
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,020
price point

135
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,720
where price could be expanding up and

136
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,539
seeing equal measured move higher or it

137
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,419
could be a third swing grade now

138
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,180
generally third swing grades are the

139
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,800
halfway point between the equilibrium

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
and the ultimate objective in your price

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,360
objective or the for the trade

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,780
generally you don't see a stop run

143
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,479
in the third swing grade right before

144
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,699
the determinants of the price move

145
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,860
you're looking to trade entirely as a

146
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,300
profit

147
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,039
go back to the lessons where we talked

148
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,199
about grading the swings and you'll see

149
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,780
what I'm referring to that third area

150
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,360
or midpoint between equilibrium and your

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,340
target generally you don't see a stop

152
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
run there but you do get a little

153
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,819
shorter box sometimes that you can trade

154
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,380
off of them this is that type of

155
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,280
scenario we can use this template

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,780
regardless of what time frame you use

157
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,039
you'll be looking for it to trade up

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,100
into your premium Market PD array and or

159
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,699
if extension overlapping of 127 or 168

160
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,539
or a perfect symmetrical price swing

161
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,720
or basically a 100 duplication or

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
measured move of the price swing and

163
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,039
traded down into the Tuesday low

164
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,300
and you'll be looking forward to trade

165
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,759
up into a time frame lesser than that of

166
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,380
what you use for the bullish order block

167
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,139
so again if we used a weekly

168
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,940
quarter block we're gonna be looking for

169
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,180
a daily or four hour premium PD array to

170
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,819
take our profits at something lining up

171
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,979
with price above us in the premium

172
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,840
Market but in a time frame lesser than

173
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,940
that which we traded our entry on

174
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,660
fair value or a liquidity void also

175
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,120
could be an instance where this trade

176
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,020
could materialize

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,660
okay the classic Tuesday high of the

178
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,160
week okay the first scenario you're

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
going to look at is a market trading up

180
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,940
into a premium Market

181
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
could be trading up to an old monthly

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,080
weekly or daily high in the form of

183
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
running a liquidity pool in other words

184
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,139
buy stops above and on high

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,099
and we'll be looking to frame the trade

186
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,400
with a time frame lesser than that which

187
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,460
we used for the premium liquidity pool

188
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,840
and we're gonna be trading down into a

189
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,699
discount Market PD array what you'll be

190
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,740
framing is

191
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,660
for instance an example would be if you

192
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,080
sold short at a daily High being ran out

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,740
for a liquidity run on buy stops you

194
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,560
could see a four hour

195
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,080
discount PD array

196
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,780
to trade down into as your objective so

197
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,280
that would be your weekly range Being

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,139
Framed another example would be if

199
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,840
you're looking for a weekly High to run

200
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
out buy stops you'd be looking for a

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
daily or four hour discount Market PD

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,220
array again you're looking for a time

203
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,840
frame lesser than that which you use to

204
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,458
trade with since we're using monthly

205
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,620
weekly and daily as a framework it gives

206
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,020
us a great deal of probability that the

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,059
moves are going to take place secondly

208
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,740
we're using a lesser time frame to take

209
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,899
our targets because if we don't want to

210
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,420
hold for what would many times take

211
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,360
greater than a week to unfold for a move

212
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,519
moving off of a monthly or weekly level

213
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,519
okay our second scenario for the classic

214
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,500
Tuesday high of the week would be the

215
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,000
market trading up into a premium market

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
and trading up to an old monthly weekly

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
or daily low that means the Market's

218
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,760
already broken down

219
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,580
out of a measure of Market structure or

220
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,640
maybe took an old low now it's retesting

221
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,860
that as support broken down resistance

222
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,380
and we'd be looking for a discount

223
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,320
Market PD array and or FIB extension of

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,600
127 and 168.

225
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,720
and or a perfect symmetrical price swing

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,940
and a time frame lesser than that which

227
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,700
we used for the premium old low so

228
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,860
they'll write it for an example we would

229
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,080
be looking for the market in a bearish

230
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,060
context we're looking for lower prices

231
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,760
overall The Market opens on Monday

232
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,459
trades up into Tuesday creating the high

233
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,700
of the week but it's retesting a old

234
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,399
monthly weekly or daily low to that

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,260
daily low whatever it is we're going to

236
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,959
be using that as our means of framing

237
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,700
our entry with the expectation that

238
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,380
we're going to be selling short looking

239
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,260
for a discount Market PD array any time

240
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,060
frame lesser than that which we used to

241
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,820
get short off of so if we're trading a

242
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,680
weekly low

243
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,399
as resistance we could also employ a

244
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,440
lower time frame bearish order block or

245
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,420
something that effect to get in sync

246
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,339
with it but for instance if we're using

247
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,080
the weekly low

248
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,839
we would be looking to trade down to a

249
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,040
discount daily or discount four hour

250
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,820
Market PD array and an overlapping FIB

251
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,200
extension

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,740
converging at the 127 or 168 or a

253
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,380
perfect symmetrical price swing now I'm

254
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,459
going to show you examples of what I

255
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,500
mean how you anchor the FIB in here in

256
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,779
several examples but just remember the

257
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,579
move up initially in the beginning of

258
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,560
the week that's your price Suite is

259
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,700
going to be using your fibon you're

260
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,019
going to run your projections off of

261
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,040
that and I'll show you what the fulcrum

262
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,240
points are for each one of these

263
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,880
foreign

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,959
value or

265
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,180
void that fills in is all that's

266
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,399
necessary before the Tuesday highs form

267
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,100
back up to that old monthly weekly or

268
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,640
daily low

269
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,820
okay our next scenario would be again a

270
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,740
fair value or liquidity void

271
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,320
and the market moving up into a premium

272
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
bearish order block either a monthly

273
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,579
weekly or daily

274
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,500
and or it could be a first swing grade

275
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,380
or at equilibrium or it could be a third

276
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,600
swing grade entry in other words if

277
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,459
we're seeing a larger longer term price

278
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,920
move going lower if we graded our swings

279
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,660
we could be looking for this scenario to

280
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,180
take place at the first grade swing

281
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,740
equilibrium

282
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,480
or the third swing grade

283
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,600
discount Market PD array

284
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,860
or FIB extension 127 168 or perfect

285
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,040
symmetrical price swing measured move

286
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,140
in a time frame lesser than the bearish

287
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,880
order block we use to trade off of now

288
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
I'll give you an example on this one

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,500
the market makers will see the for

290
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,540
instance we could Gap open lower

291
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,880
on Sunday and then all through Monday we

292
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,920
could trade up through higher and then

293
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,899
up into Tuesday London open arm New York

294
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,760
open we could create the high of the

295
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,680
week we would be in a premium Market

296
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,959
relative to the weekly range that's just

297
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,540
started we would potentially fill in a

298
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,700
fair value Gap or a liquidity void

299
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,760
trading back up to for instance a

300
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,000
daily bear shoulder block so if it gets

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,279
to a daily bearish order block we could

302
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,640
be using a four hour discount Market PD

303
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,720
array that overlaps with a 127 or 168 or

304
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,000
perfect symmetrical price swing in our

305
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,079
fib

306
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,000
we're using a time frame lesser than our

307
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,220
bearish order block entry in other words

308
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,959
it was a daily in this example I gave

309
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,660
you we'd be looking for a four hour

310
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,700
discount PD rating to take our profits

311
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,920
but it has to overlap with a projection

312
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,500
on that fair value or liquidity void

313
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,940
swing that's going up into Tuesday

314
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,160
that's your swing so you would measure

315
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,139
your Fib from that low up to the high

316
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,579
that's one on Tuesday and your

317
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,440
projections down in the form of 127 or

318
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,399
168. if they overlap and converge with a

319
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,579
four hour discount PD array then you

320
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,839
have your target for the week and you

321
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,279
can Define what their weekly range would

322
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,279
be and you hold for the opportunity to

323
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,779
unfold until Thursday and maybe into

324
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,139
Friday

325
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,420
okay now we look at the Wednesday low of

326
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,459
the week okay this is a market profile

327
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,120
that's bullish

328
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,980
okay we'll generally see the market show

329
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,920
a short-term low on Monday and trading

330
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
up into Tuesday and then Tuesday we'll

331
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
see it trade lower

332
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,519
down into a discount market now it could

333
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,899
be trading down into an old monthly

334
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,360
weekly or daily low for a liquidity pool

335
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,060
in other words running out sell stops

336
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,560
and we're looking for the market to

337
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
trade up into a premium Market PD array

338
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,060
in a time frame lesser than the discount

339
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,760
liquidity pool that we use to train off

340
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
of for a long you'll see this if you're

341
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,500
familiar with my old teachings many

342
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,600
times this is the framework I use for a

343
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,060
reflection pattern and trust me I'll go

344
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,620
through all these patterns in August

345
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,720
when we fill in a lot of the gaps on

346
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
things that are just subtle nuances and

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,639
little extra tips I throw in that don't

348
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,920
really have a place always that I can

349
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
clearly Define it where this always does

350
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,240
this or does that there's going to be

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,860
some quirky things I teach you in August

352
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,139
so that's one of those things I'm also

353
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,079
going to apply but the uh

354
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,560
the reflection pattern is basically a

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,399
127 or 168 extension where it runs at an

356
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,260
old low but it's going to trade down to

357
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,720
a discount Market PD array

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,120
if it takes out the cell stops below the

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,740
lows we're going to be looking for the

360
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,660
market to trade up into Thursday or

361
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,360
Friday preferably Friday into a premium

362
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,880
Market PD array if we're going to see

363
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
this occur on a weekly we're going to be

364
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,100
looking for the long on the weekly

365
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,060
and exiting our position on a daily or

366
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,680
four hour premium Market PD array

367
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,100
okay our next example for the Wednesday

368
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,740
low of the week we can frame our Market

369
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,860
with a discount Market old monthly

370
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,360
weekly or daily high in other words

371
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,399
we've seen the market trade up broken

372
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,279
out now it's coming back down Monday we

373
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
started to trade up a little bit then

374
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,459
Tuesday it traded lower

375
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,040
down to the old High

376
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,019
so it could be a monthly high that

377
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,079
retains back down into on Wednesday

378
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,779
and we're going to be framing that with

379
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,040
an expectation of seeing the market

380
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,040
rally up into Friday

381
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,399
with a premium Market PD array and or

382
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,620
FIB extension 127 168 or perfect

383
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,839
symmetrical price swing in a time frame

384
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,639
lesser than that of which we use for the

385
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,639
old high long so for instance if we

386
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,459
bought a old monthly High retest after

387
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,920
it's broken out we can see the monthly

388
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,139
High acting as support so our electric

389
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,500
time frame PD array or premium Target

390
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,360
would be seen either in a weekly daily

391
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,699
or four hour

392
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,980
the key is finding where it overlaps

393
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,440
with the 127 and 168. we're not just

394
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
simply looking for 127 and 168

395
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,060
extensions we're doing that also and

396
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,220
coupling it with in all these examples

397
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,540
with a lesser time frame PD array that's

398
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,220
contrary to what we use to enter the

399
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,459
trade

400
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,500
okay our third example for the Wednesday

401
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,360
low of the week we can see the market

402
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,339
trade down into Wednesday into a

403
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,380
discount Market

404
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,600
when the markets generally primarily

405
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
bullish anyway and we're going to trade

406
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,079
into a bullish order block and it could

407
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,639
be in the form of a monthly or weekly or

408
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,860
daily or it could be a first swing grade

409
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,199
entry in other words if we see the

410
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,259
market moving higher much longer term

411
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,839
than just one week and we're seeing our

412
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,459
first retracement back where we can get

413
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,079
our lawn

414
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,420
take a swing trade or a position trade

415
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,380
on that

416
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,540
it could occur at that first swing grade

417
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,459
or it could occur at the equilibrium of

418
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,619
the overall price move or halfway point

419
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,299
of what you expect to see as an overall

420
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,020
price Target or could occur at the third

421
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,980
swing rate in other words one half

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,660
between where you're halfway point

423
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,880
equilibrium is for the trade

424
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,579
and the ultimate Target now when we look

425
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,220
at Price swings or targets And Trades we

426
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,460
graduated into four stages first stage

427
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,140
second stage takes us to equilibrium

428
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,840
third stage or third swing grade and

429
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,700
then the fourth is Terminus where the

430
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,100
end of the trade takes effect and that's

431
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,440
where your profits are taken that's the

432
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,539
maximum we expect to see the market move

433
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,919
this occurs sometimes at the first

434
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,559
equilibrium and third swing grade as a

435
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,419
potential opportunity so the market

436
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,539
could be just floating around between a

437
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,700
premium and discount Market on Sunday

438
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,679
and Monday and Tuesday but then

439
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,120
Wednesday it trades down into a discount

440
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,160
level where it clearly hits a order

441
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,260
block and now can be capitalized and

442
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,880
send price higher up in through Thursday

443
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,500
into Friday

444
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,440
whichever you use in other words the

445
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,820
time frame you use to go long on

446
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,799
whatever that order block is whatever

447
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,480
time frame it is that you use for

448
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,220
instance could be a daily we're going to

449
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,200
be looking for a premium Market PD array

450
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,140
with an overlapping FIB of 127 168 or

451
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,120
symmetrical price swing

452
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,919
in a lesser time frame in other words if

453
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,419
we've seen it on a daily that we bought

454
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,100
a bullish order block on on Wednesday

455
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,860
we're looking for the four hour

456
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,799
premium pdra that overlaps with a 127

457
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,140
168 or a perfect symmetrical price swing

458
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,179
the fair value or liquidity void

459
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,000
that run down that price swing is what

460
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,679
you use your fibs on to run your

461
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,860
extensions for 127 168 or perfect 100

462
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,419
percent

463
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,340
duplication of that price swing down

464
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,840
just projected from the high

465
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,120
okay Wednesday high of the week this is

466
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,919
when you're looking for a bearish market

467
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,240
environment

468
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,640
okay and you have a short-term High here

469
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,460
the market will trade up into a premium

470
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,480
Market

471
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,700
up into an old monthly weekly or daily

472
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,260
High liquidity pool in other words it's

473
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,820
running out an old High

474
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,340
and we're framing the idea with a move

475
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,820
down into a discount Market PD array in

476
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,500
a time frame lesser than that which we

477
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,539
used for a premium liquidity pool for

478
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,880
instance if we are expecting bearish

479
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
prices and this can occur in an

480
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
equilibrium area on a larger price move

481
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
that you expect maybe from a position

482
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,299
Trader's mindset or a swing Traders

483
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,280
mindset in other words if you're looking

484
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,559
for a move that's much longer than just

485
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,660
uh just one week

486
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,700
we could be the Midway point of that and

487
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,140
you'll see a short-term High being ran

488
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,960
out this is a classic stop run and this

489
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,419
is generally what you see on a Wednesday

490
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:53,760
and if you see it on since for instance

491
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,200
like a weekly

492
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,059
liquidity pool if he runs out a weekly

493
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,559
High

494
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,840
it takes out those buy stops we could

495
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,760
expect to see a daily or four hour

496
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,940
discount PD array be our objective

497
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,600
for the week

498
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
another example for Wednesday high of

499
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,020
the week okay we have a fair value or

500
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,660
liquidity void and then it runs through

501
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,240
that for the stops

502
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,419
if we see that and we're overall bearish

503
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,559
disc again we're gonna be looking for

504
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,780
this as a scenario where

505
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,720
it's a retest to an old load okay this

506
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,520
could be a return back to a premium

507
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
Market in front of an old monthly weekly

508
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,220
or daily low

509
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,960
and we're looking for a discount Market

510
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,440
PD array and or a fib extension of 127

511
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,780
to 168 and or a perfect symmetrical

512
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,700
price swing and the time frame lesser

513
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,740
than that which we use for a premium or

514
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,240
blow retest

515
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,280
so in other words if we're looking for a

516
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,100
retest back to a monthly low

517
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,760
if we get short on that monthly low

518
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,900
narrowing down our time frames down to a

519
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,700
smaller time frame which we'll learn in

520
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,220
April and in May

521
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,320
with a shorter time frames but when we

522
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,059
use the hourly chart

523
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,340
we can fine tune that to a smaller

524
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,320
degree of risk

525
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,179
but we're framing our trade-off of the

526
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,980
monthly load that's being retested

527
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,679
traded button to Wednesday we'll be

528
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,840
looking for that opportunity

529
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,539
to send us lower if it's monthly that

530
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,280
we're looking at that low on Wednesday

531
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
to sell short from we're gonna be

532
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,240
looking for a weekly daily or four hour

533
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,360
discount PD array that has an extension

534
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,419
overlap of 127 to 168 or perfect

535
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,659
symmetrical price swing from that low up

536
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,419
to Wednesday's high in other words

537
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,400
Tuesday's low to Wednesdays high that

538
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
price swing up that's what you're going

539
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,400
to be anchoring your FIB on and the

540
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
extensions below Tuesday's low would be

541
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,900
a projection of 127 168 or a perfect

542
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,460
symmetrical price swing or that of

543
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
Tuesday's low the Wednesday's High

544
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,260
that range subtracted from Tuesday's low

545
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,460
that would be a perfect symmetrical

546
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,559
price swing if you get that overlapping

547
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
with a in this case if we're looking at

548
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,539
a monthly low uh we could be looking

549
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,179
from a weekly daily or four hour

550
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,460
discount PD array that overlaps with

551
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,260
that so again we're blending time and

552
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,500
price

553
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
in the last example for Wednesday high

554
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,440
of the week we're looking for a fair

555
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,720
value or liquidity void

556
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
price going up into a premium into a

557
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,280
bearish order block on a monthly weekly

558
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,559
or daily basis or it could be returned

559
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,200
back into our first retracement of an

560
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,820
overall larger price swing and this will

561
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,039
be the first swing grade entry or it can

562
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,980
occur at equilibrium or it could be a

563
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,539
third swing grade entry

564
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,400
discount Market PD array or FIB

565
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,159
extension preferably both overlapping a

566
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,400
127 or 168 or perfect symmetrical price

567
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,500
swing in a time frame lesser than that

568
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,940
of the bearish order block that we used

569
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,320
to trade entry on

570
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,460
consolidation Thursday reversal okay

571
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,720
this is a market profile that's

572
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,460
generally bullish

573
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,380
you'll see this happen where the Market

574
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,100
opens up on a Sunday and Monday trades

575
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,299
sideways on Monday and Tuesday into

576
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,860
Wednesday and then all of a sudden

577
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,700
Market trades down on Thursday into a

578
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,220
discount Market

579
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,280
you've been looking for many times

580
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,720
Traders expecting the market to shoot

581
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,760
higher because of buy stocks being taken

582
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
out or will be deemed as a market

583
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,100
structure shift bullishly

584
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,179
but we're looking for sell stuff in a

585
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,039
bullish Market to be ran out

586
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,360
so when that happens generally it's

587
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,740
going to be like an fomc or an

588
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,419
employment release the fomc release

589
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,159
generally happens around the two o'clock

590
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,679
hour in Eastern Standard Time New York

591
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,980
time or it could be a New York session

592
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,000
employment data released that can send

593
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,039
the market higher based on this false

594
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,240
break below

595
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,700
an old low early in the week on Monday

596
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,799
or Tuesday

597
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,840
this false break becomes a turtle suit

598
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,360
long and you're looking for the market

599
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,039
to trade up into where the weekly buy

600
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,260
stops are this is your liquidity pool

601
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,760
and it's going to trade up into that

602
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
level as your weekly objective

603
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,740
so your one shot one kill setup would be

604
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,620
buying the break below

605
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,480
the weekly low on Monday or Tuesday

606
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,539
running out to sell stops on the heels

607
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,020
of either a high impact news event

608
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,780
with employment data on the New York

609
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,039
session around 8 30 in the morning

610
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,799
Eastern Standard time or if you're again

611
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,740
if you just want to play the fomc

612
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,320
announcement once the market drives down

613
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,659
takes those sell stops out if you can

614
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,880
take a very very very very low risk

615
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,600
entry and small position don't put a lot

616
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,559
of money on this type of trade because

617
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,480
if it's fomc you can get really crushed

618
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,820
if it's a lot of whips on it but if

619
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,860
you're going to be trading fomc very

620
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,539
very small position wait for the initial

621
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,340
knee-jerk reaction put your limit order

622
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,919
down below the low let's follow Monday

623
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,179
and Tuesday

624
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,400
absorb all those sell stops and look for

625
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,380
the buy stops to be ran out for the

626
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,240
intraday

627
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,720
high or running out the entry week high

628
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
in the form of the buy stops liquidity

629
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,059
pool

630
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,780
so your one shot one kill would be

631
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,520
framed only Thursday going into Friday

632
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,140
so it's really one day's worth of action

633
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,360
that you waited for all week but the

634
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,679
scenario looks like this generally

635
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
consolidation service a reversal this is

636
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
when you're looking for bearish markets

637
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,860
on Thursday the market trades up into a

638
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,260
premium Market earlier in the week it'll

639
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,059
look like it's taking out sell stuff or

640
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,919
Market structure shift has broken to the

641
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,720
downside and then Wednesday into

642
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,760
Thursday you'll see the buy stuff taken

643
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,980
they were formed intra week

644
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,279
usually fomc 2 pm Eastern stand time or

645
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,220
a 8 30 a.m Eastern Standard Time

646
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,919
employment release could be the driver

647
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,919
for this or the Market's driven up to

648
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,480
above the intra-week high to take out

649
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,100
the buy stops in an overall bearish

650
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,380
Market environment in the market

651
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,539
causes a false break this is a turtle

652
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,980
soup short

653
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,600
and you'll be looking for the targeting

654
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,940
of the cell stops below the intra-week

655
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,260
low for your liquidity pool

656
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,279
okay and consolidation midweek rally

657
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,740
this is a bullish Market profile and

658
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,539
what we generally look for is the market

659
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,760
to start off on a Monday right right

660
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,740
from the beginning

661
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,600
and on Tuesday you'll see retracement

662
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,140
down into Wednesday

663
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,919
and you're going to be moving back into

664
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,260
a discount fair value Gap or liquidity

665
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,600
void or bullish order block

666
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,059
so any one of those scenarios could be

667
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,919
your Catalyst but you're looking for a

668
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,980
discount PD array

669
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,440
and you're expecting on Wednesday a high

670
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,900
or medium impact news event either in

671
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,179
London or in New York session

672
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,860
your swing projection or fulcrum point

673
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,279
is the intra week high formed on Tuesday

674
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,360
now this could also be a Monday High

675
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,740
ticket in other words it can trade up to

676
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,360
creating a short-term high on Monday and

677
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,740
then trading down Tuesday and into

678
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,400
Wednesday but that's one simple caveat

679
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
to this this template and it's a reverse

680
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,460
for when you're looking for a

681
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,820
consolidation midweek decline

682
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,760
what you're aiming for a premium PD

683
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,260
array either in the form of a monthly

684
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,240
weekly or daily and converging FIB

685
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
extensions of 127 and or 168.

686
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,320
or could be a perfect measure

687
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,779
swing projection now what does that mean

688
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,840
the swing projection fulcrum is the

689
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,539
highest high at which the market starts

690
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,460
to retrace from that's the point which

691
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,620
you want to pull your FIB down from into

692
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,299
where it trades into the order block

693
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,980
that'll give your swing projections up

694
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,500
into the premium PD arrays let's take a

695
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,520
look at that what that looks like an

696
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,419
example

697
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,880
so we have our high here this is going

698
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,860
to be our swing point for outcome and

699
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,720
then we're going to take our FIB anchor

700
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,880
from the high down into the oral block

701
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,500
or whatever PDA rate that we're using

702
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,779
for a discount to enter that's our level

703
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,640
we expect price to move up from so

704
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,740
there's our range

705
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,880
what we get then is an extension of 127

706
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,320
and or

707
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,200
168 FIB extension which takes us up into

708
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,960
the premium Market what we look for not

709
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,380
just a fib of 127 or 168 we're looking

710
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,500
for a time frame lesser than that which

711
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,559
we used to get long on

712
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,960
either a bullish order block or bear

713
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,400
shorter block whatever that time frame

714
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,799
we see forming

715
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,440
our entry on on Wednesday

716
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,779
we use a lesser time frame to take our

717
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,039
profits at

718
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,799
but it has to be an overlapping of a

719
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,080
premium PD array and a lesser time frame

720
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,419
you use to buy at

721
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,380
that overlaps with 127 and 168.

722
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,799
now the FIB overlap levels are based on

723
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,260
the time frame we enter on

724
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,039
we look for a lower time frame

725
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,440
COPD array in a premium range to overlap

726
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,900
with that 127 and 168 when we get those

727
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,659
two things we have a high Confluence

728
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,480
level where we have both time and price

729
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,240
and a green where the algo may very

730
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,039
easily retrain for those levels and then

731
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,980
that'd be it for the Target

732
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,399
okay consolidation midweek decline this

733
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,140
is a bearish market environment

734
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,559
okay what we're seeing is on Wednesday

735
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,260
you'll see uh it could it could occur on

736
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,360
Tuesday too but we're looking for a

737
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,559
premium

738
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,840
fair value Gap or liquidity void to be

739
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,399
filled in or trading up into a bearish

740
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,380
order block

741
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,020
and high or medium impact news

742
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,500
in Wednesday London open or New York

743
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,240
open

744
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,039
and we have a swing projection fulcrum

745
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,419
point

746
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,460
and we expect to see the market trade

747
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,799
down to a discount PD array in the form

748
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,899
of a monthly weekly daily and converging

749
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,080
fit extensions in the form of 127 or 168

750
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,460
and again it could be a perfect

751
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,159
symmetrical price swing or 100 measured

752
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,279
move

753
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,279
so let's take a look at what that looks

754
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,380
like as well in Reverse terms of what we

755
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,419
just showed for the buy side

756
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,940
okay we have our premium fair value Gap

757
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,640
or liquidity void and or bearish order

758
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,559
block but normally we're looking to sell

759
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,279
short at a premium PD array in a bearish

760
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,899
market environment

761
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,080
we know our low the week is formed we've

762
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,279
measure that up

763
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,320
from our fulcrum point

764
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
and we get our 127 extension from that

765
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,740
low

766
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,140
to Wednesday's High

767
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,020
projected down that's 127 percent of the

768
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,279
range between Tuesdays low and

769
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,779
Wednesdays High

770
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,200
and then we get the 168 percent of the

771
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
range of Tuesday's load when it stays

772
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,799
high now you don't need a Fibonacci

773
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,899
overlay tool for this all you have to do

774
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,760
is get Wednesday's highest high and

775
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,380
Tuesday's lowest low

776
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,480
and or it could be Wednesday's low okay

777
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,679
but basically you're looking for the

778
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,559
lowest low between Mondays

779
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,860
opening and Wednesday when it trades up

780
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,419
it's got to be trading up so whatever

781
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,940
the highest high is that forms your

782
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,760
projected low is whatever the range low

783
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,820
is for the week up to Wednesday's High

784
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,399
that range in terms of Pips times that

785
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,220
by 1.27 and that will give you

786
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,620
your range that you subtract from

787
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,659
Wednesday's High

788
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,279
and you can do the same thing for the

789
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,080
range from below the week up to

790
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,340
Wednesday's High

791
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,380
whatever that is in terms of Pips each

792
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,919
times up by 1.68 and you subtract that

793
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,320
number of Pips from Wednesday's high and

794
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,520
that'll give you your Fibonacci

795
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,480
extension whoa

796
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,740
okay so you can destroy bullish Friday

797
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,419
okay this is a low probability or

798
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,760
neutral condition all we're really doing

799
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,080
is watching to see if it gives us any

800
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,399
favorable outcome and it's more or less

801
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,659
a market environment you want to be

802
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,220
either on the sidelines or just

803
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,120
demonstrating just for experience

804
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,159
okay the market will generally create a

805
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,600
small consolidation throughout the week

806
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,299
going into Thursday we have a liquidity

807
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,740
pool for cell stops it's forms in intra

808
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,919
week

809
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,820
higher medium impact news on Thursday

810
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,039
usually it's tight like I said it's

811
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,760
either fomc or employment

812
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,039
decision

813
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,600
and we're going to be anticipating the

814
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,700
sell stop raid below the lows of the

815
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,820
week

816
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,899
intra week buy stocks would be

817
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,620
determined

818
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,120
and a liquidity run to a daily or weekly

819
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,179
premium PD array would be the result in

820
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,140
other words we're not going to be

821
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,120
looking just for a intro week run on buy

822
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
stops we're going to be looking for a

823
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,919
run completely above all of the entry

824
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,860
week highs to a liquidity run on daily

825
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,179
or weekly

826
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,460
premium PD arrays

827
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,600
so in other words we're going to be

828
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,179
creating a new weekly Range High in a

829
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,279
level that hadn't been traded for so far

830
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,140
for that week and it's going to move it

831
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,600
aggressively and very speedily to that

832
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,039
level now this Market environment can

833
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,960
occur when the Market's bullish but it

834
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,700
also can occur when the Market's bearish

835
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,480
if the market trades Down Below in Old

836
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,760
low or breaks out on a higher time frame

837
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,580
but sales that have any movement lower

838
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,679
we can get a Thursday high impact on

839
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,419
medium impact news event or interest

840
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,419
rate environment that sends us

841
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,500
aggressively higher in this environment

842
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,899
or this Market profile

843
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,820
this is one of the hardest ones to trade

844
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,019
and if you see the market just

845
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,460
consolidating back and forth taken by

846
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,960
stops and sell stocks you know

847
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,940
throughout the week it's probably better

848
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,380
for you to sit on your hands and just

849
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,240
don't trade it anymore because the

850
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,580
chances are you getting this right are

851
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
not 50 50. you know and if you're wrong

852
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,159
it can really blow through whatever your

853
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,140
stop loss is if especially if it's fomc

854
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,559
or if it's you know um

855
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,820
well it would just have to be something

856
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,679
along with the monetary policy once it

857
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,139
gets up to a daily or weekly premium PD

858
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,659
array what we're looking for there is we

859
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,099
want to see possibly a potential

860
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,359
reversal

861
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,099
so what we're doing is why is this

862
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,719
template useful that's your answer

863
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,520
you're waiting for it to get up to a

864
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,639
daily or weekly premium PD array once it

865
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,899
does that we are expecting a reversal

866
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,580
okay so you can destroy bearish Friday

867
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,379
again this is a neutral low probability

868
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,000
profile and Market manipulation template

869
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,820
what we're looking for is the outcome of

870
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,099
this we're not looking to trade it

871
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,839
so we're looking for the market to

872
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,219
create a consolidation Monday through

873
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,800
Wednesday and then building a liquidity

874
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,679
pool of buy stops intra week and on

875
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,060
Thursday

876
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,659
we anticipate that market to be taken up

877
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,960
to that level taking out the buy stops

878
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,420
and a run on high end or medium impact

879
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,160
news usually is the Catalyst for that

880
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,740
we're anticipating the buy stop breed

881
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,599
and the market will run the intra-week

882
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,240
cell stops and ultimately Target a

883
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,880
liquidity run to a daily end or weekly

884
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,760
discount PD array

885
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,560
again we're not looking to trade this

886
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,780
we're looking for it to unfold usually

887
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,040
when the markets are in consolidation

888
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,599
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and it's

889
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,020
usually like a employment number or it's

890
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,119
a fomc type event that type of Market

891
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,940
driver that's released later on in the

892
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,160
week the second half of the week uh post

893
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,140
Wednesday in New York open

894
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,960
we're looking for the market to run to a

895
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,260
higher time frame PD array okay and if

896
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,540
we see they run to buy stops intra week

897
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,099
and they sync it lower what we're going

898
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,900
to be watching for not that we're trying

899
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,460
to trade it we're looking for it to

900
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,500
trade down into a higher time frame

901
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,320
daily or weekly discount PD array when

902
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,000
that happens what we're looking for is a

903
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,079
potential reversal

904
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
okay uh Wednesday weekly reversal now

905
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,579
this is not the same as the Wednesday

906
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,220
low of the week uh templates that we're

907
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,859
given into towards the front of the um

908
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,200
this presentation this is a little bit

909
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,480
slight slightly different

910
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,780
we're looking for an old low or retail

911
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,700
support

912
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,460
and high or medium impact news drives

913
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,320
price down below that

914
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,960
and it is generally on a hard time frame

915
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,820
basis that we see these types of moves

916
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,839
taking place in other words we're

917
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,839
running a weekly monthly level or

918
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,000
support level out and it's on the heels

919
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,579
of higher medium impact news and then

920
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,560
once it dries down below that the Market

921
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,680
discounts that news and reverses what

922
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,119
we're looking for is a Fibonacci

923
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,420
extension of 127 or 168 or even a

924
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,740
perfect symmetrical price Wing but

925
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,839
generally it's usually a 127 or 168

926
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,859
extension from the old low

927
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,720
retail support rally up into Tuesday's

928
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,839
High project that down that'll give us

929
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,099
some measure of extension

930
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,800
the market usually will find its way

931
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,599
down into a monthly weekly or daily

932
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,780
discount array and we'll be using the

933
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,880
swing projection fulcrum point to

934
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,000
project up to a 127 or 168 extension and

935
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,180
overlapping of a weekly or daily premium

936
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,640
PD array

937
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,400
and lastly the Wednesday weekly reversal

938
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
when the market is bearish

939
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,420
okay we're looking for old high or

940
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,119
retail resistance higher medium impact

941
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,220
news runs it above it and then the

942
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,839
market rejects or discounts that news

943
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,940
event and it takes us up into a

944
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,400
Fibonacci one extent 127 or 168

945
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,760
extension and a monthly weekly or daily

946
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,680
premium array in order to looking for

947
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,119
something up there to align with that

948
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,339
127 168 extension

949
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,560
and then the market will look to move

950
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
below the swing projection fulcrum Point

951
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,820
down into a weekly or daily discount PD

952
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,040
array overlapping with a Fibonacci

953
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,220
extension of 127 or 168. now what I gave

954
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,119
you is basically the The Playbook that I

955
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,640
use when I go about trying to find my

956
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,619
one shot one kills

957
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,780
the weekly range you'll find it

958
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,760
generally will be one of these templates

959
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
okay and while it probably looks like a

960
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,560
whole lot okay it's a handful of them

961
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,300
but you're already going to know if

962
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,320
you're going to be bullish or bearish

963
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,060
based on a higher time frame information

964
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,880
that we talked in January

965
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,520
so if you're looking for information to

966
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,400
lead to bullish or bearish ideas if we

967
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
have that limited to okay we want to be

968
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,140
a bullish we go to our profiles that are

969
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,000
bullish and we start looking for

970
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
telltale signs of characteristics that

971
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,440
are given to you in these uh slides and

972
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,900
it was taught in the second least lesson

973
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,599
of this month by blending that and also

974
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,700
looking for the manipulation factor that

975
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,020
takes place how the market makers

976
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,000
manipulate price Within These market

977
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,040
profiles you're going to see that it's

978
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,619
pretty much almost like the script now

979
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,579
the key is is once you identify it the

980
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,460
moves that transpire on Tuesday and

981
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,560
Wednesday you may not get the actual

982
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,599
highest high to Short from or the lowest

983
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,480
low to buy from and that's not important

984
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,220
once we have the range defined and we

985
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,800
see the characteristics that outline a

986
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
potential Direction going into Friday's

987
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,820
close that in itself can be your

988
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,560
One-Shot one kill so you can look for

989
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
opportunities on the back end of the

990
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,280
week not necessarily having demanding

991
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,079
and treat on Tuesday or Wednesday

992
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,760
because I teach Tuesday and Wednesday

993
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,380
generally will give you the higher low

994
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,640
of the week if it's a bullish or bearish

995
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,180
prospective Market that's not necessary

996
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,740
one shot one kill is you're looking for

997
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,720
one setup to pay you your weekly

998
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,940
objective my objective is usually 50 to

999
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,339
75 Pips a week so if I'm looking for

1000
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:45,359
something that's going to frame that

1001
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,940
that type of move I'm generally going to

1002
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,980
be using these manipulation templates to

1003
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,660
frame the idea whether I'm bullish or

1004
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,920
bearish and I'm looking for

1005
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,359
characteristics to line up if they don't

1006
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,280
line up with what's been described in

1007
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,020
lesson two and in this lesson here in

1008
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,880
lesson three if those characteristics

1009
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,520
aren't obvious or in alignment then I'm

1010
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,540
generally going to sit on my hands in

1011
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,400
either day trade or scalp or do nothing

1012
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,339
but for one shot one kill setups this is

1013
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,020
kind of like my playbook and what I go

1014
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,579
to so while it's going to take some

1015
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,020
study on your part to go through and

1016
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,400
convince yourself that these are the

1017
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,540
templates of how the market actually

1018
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,119
operates uh just pick a pair just pick

1019
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,599
any individual pair go through a period

1020
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,540
of I don't know three to four months

1021
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,579
using an hourly chart and go back and

1022
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,579
see what each weekly profile looked like

1023
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,560
and how the manipulation took place that

1024
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,720
made that Weekly range form as it did

1025
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,520
and you'll see that many times you're

1026
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,960
going to see that this is this is the

1027
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
profile and template they use to

1028
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,280
manipulate price and you also see how

1029
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,660
it's easy to get to those profit

1030
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,640
objectives that you don't otherwise

1031
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,980
think of by using the Lesser time frame

1032
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,900
that we used for our entry

1033
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,760
so until next lesson I wish good luck

1034
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,720
and good Trading
