00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,020
welcome to the ICT mentorship short-term

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,120
trading lesson number six

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,219
we're teaching low resistance liquidity

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,660
runs in trending conditions

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,779
okay much like we mentioned in the low

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,279
resistance liquidity runs in

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,019
consolidations

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,060
the same thing applies obviously in

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,740
training conditions because we

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,420
understand that the market moves from a

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
time and price Theory

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,739
for looking back 20 40 and 60 trading

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,620
days for if the data ranges and

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,180
referencing time

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,340
and for one shot one kill or short-term

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,800
trading we focus primarily in the last

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,860
three months for the most Salient

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,680
institutional reference points

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,680
we key off of obviously the PD arrays

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,860
based on a premium or discount Market

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,899
and we're looking to trade from one PD

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,360
array to the next ideally from a

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,760
discount to a premium range that can be

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,539
easily defined

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,460
okay for our case study for liquidity

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,260
runs and training conditions we're going

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,060
to be looking at the pound again

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,680
and this time we're going to be looking

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,020
at a different fractal of the larger

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,460
consolidation so we're going to be

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
looking at a smaller segment of this

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,759
price action

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,340
and because price is universally fractal

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,259
what could be a consolidation on one

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,820
time frame can be a trending environment

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,220
in another

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,240
so we're going to add our PD arrays from

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,820
the monthly weekly daily and we're going

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,340
to use this information in conjunction

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,860
with the trending environment conditions

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,399
that we use to trade from a low end

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,299
discount to a high-end premium Market in

43
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,439
other words we're going to be looking at

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,220
an example of buying during a upswing or

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,600
a trending bull market

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,860
our case studies going to be focusing on

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,780
this price lag here

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,179
as identified in the Shaded area

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,860
and this is going to be our trending

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,540
condition

51
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,700
now before we get into it notice that we

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
are originating the

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,620
basis of that swing up

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,360
from a deep discount Market overall

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
the larger consolidation we can see

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
clearly that the market has found

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,940
support

58
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,099
and because we're in a discount Market

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,260
the market generally is going to want to

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,140
move to a premium either by a short-term

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,300
basis or any turn basis or a long-term

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,220
basis so since we're looking for

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,680
short-term trades we know that

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,200
predominantly the market in the March

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,700
time period

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,280
is in a oversold condition

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,260
in oversold condition

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,660
or defined as we refer to it as a

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,459
discount market so the market is going

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,680
to want to reach up into some measure of

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,360
a premium

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
if there's a displacement and the market

73
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
trades higher we'll know that because

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,840
the market is showing a aggressive

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
nature to trade higher and if that is

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
being shown in price then we know that

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,080
institutions are funneling money and

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,140
they're also building positions in that

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,540
up move now obviously if they are

80
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,099
building long positions and the market

81
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,319
is accelerating on the upside they're

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,180
reaching for some institutional

83
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,800
reference point where they can unload

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,900
that long position at a profitable point

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,379
they have to find willing buyers at a

86
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,060
higher level so we have to look for

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,940
premium PD arrays where willing

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,159
participants in the marketplace will

89
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,120
want to buy from a lower holding long

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,640
holder or in this case smart money

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,700
okay for one shot one kill uh we're

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,400
gonna be dealing specifically with the

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,019
four hour chart now the four hour chart

94
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,099
is in my opinion the easiest Trading

95
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,739
time frame for one shot one kill setups

96
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,720
or how to frame that's set up

97
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,640
uh because it's my cup of tea if you

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,760
will it's my forte my my go-to trading

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,720
model

100
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,379
um

101
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,260
I have learned that the four hour chart

102
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,480
can give us all the insights that's

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,019
necessary for using all the details and

104
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,358
and components to finding one shot one

105
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,220
kill or short-term trading with high

106
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,560
probability trading conditions

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,780
so by using a four hour chart

108
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,840
it's easier to frame a One-Shot one kill

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,820
or short-term trade

110
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,919
in this time frame because you can see

111
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,160
with a simple couple clicks of your mt4

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,380
platform and if your platform doesn't

113
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,000
use this whatever the equivalent would

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,780
be but if you hold down

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,840
control and touch the letter Y

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,479
it'll give you the date dividers

117
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,180
okay and specifically when you're in

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,740
four hour it's not giving you the daily

119
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,139
dividers it's actually giving you the

120
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,840
weekly dividers so every vertical dotted

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,759
line here represents the beginning and

122
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,220
end of a new trading week

123
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,139
when we look at Price like this and we

124
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,479
have the PD arrays on our chart it's

125
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,120
very easy to see where price will reach

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,880
up to notice that we're also looking at

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
this pair with the gradients shown

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,840
across all of the discount and premium

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
ranges so we not only have the discount

130
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
premium range divided

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,440
then we have the upper portion divided

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,360
and then we have those smaller divisions

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,120
in half as well so we can see how the

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,639
market has different levels of

135
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,100
progressive premium and Progressive

136
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,979
discount levels in other words lower

137
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,259
levels of discount and higher levels of

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,580
Premium

139
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
when we look at the four hour chart and

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,740
we can see a PD array for instance a

141
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,780
discount PD array this could be in the

142
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,419
form of a bullish order block an old low

143
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,860
a fair value Gap a breaker any of these

144
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,199
types of PD arrays

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,479
if we're looking to go long

146
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,800
if that occurs or forms near a

147
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,919
divider level or a quadrant level as I

148
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,380
call it you'll be able to see high

149
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,460
probability

150
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,280
movement away from that level and then

151
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,860
reach for an opposing level for instance

152
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,520
if we look at the market

153
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
in March

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,440
15th where price had come down into the

155
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,720
fair value Gap it also trades back to a

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
breaker

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,020
seen here

158
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,460
that move

159
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,319
trading to that level

160
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,139
gives us an ideal scenario to get along

161
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,440
we may have missed the entry at a lower

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
level

163
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,120
but we can see this return to a breaker

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
or

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,060
fair value

166
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,919
and Market explodes on the upside And

167
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,180
Trades higher

168
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,000
you don't need the absolute low in a

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,660
bullish weekly close or up weekly range

170
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,240
to be a One-Shot one kill you just need

171
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,460
one setup that you wait for that makes

172
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,460
logical sense that gives you a realistic

173
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,940
pip objective and I think realistically

174
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,259
uh for starters you should be looking

175
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,660
for 30 to 50 Pips a week those types of

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,940
scenarios and then graduate into 50 to

177
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,300
75 and then 75 to 100 Pips per week I

178
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,000
wouldn't try to go more than 100 Pips

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,860
and I like to live in a 50 to 75 pit

180
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
range myself personally but you do to

181
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,539
suit yourself I just know that you're

182
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,340
not always going to get big weekly

183
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,960
ranges sometimes you'll get small weekly

184
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,220
ranges and it's going to be harder for

185
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,259
you to get that 100 pit range if it only

186
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,660
moves about 150 Pips for the week so

187
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,240
you're going to really Define a perfect

188
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,300
entry and exit strategy to get that I'm

189
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,800
not saying it can't be done folks but

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,940
you know just give yourself some

191
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,220
flexibility on both ends getting in and

192
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,479
getting out and so if you're looking for

193
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,520
the lines portion of the weekly range

194
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,500
you know

195
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,560
taking a portion of that is all that's

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,580
necessary for your career

197
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,479
so if you look at the four hour chart

198
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,819
what we're doing is we're encapsulating

199
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,340
the weekly range and you can see this is

200
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,380
the entire weekly range for this

201
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,880
particular week

202
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,500
shaded in yellow

203
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
you can also see that the market reaches

204
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,879
up into logical areas of Premium PD

205
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,680
arrays and we'll cover that in a few

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020
moments but look at this for a second

207
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
and think about the power three that I

208
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,760
teach where if the Market's bullish the

209
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,279
open will be near the low or the range

210
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,899
and the close will be near the high of

211
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,099
the range

212
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,380
you can see that here

213
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,740
the market has a initial move lower

214
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,420
in the beginning of the week makes the

215
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,519
low of the week and then it explodes on

216
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
the upside it gives a few not many a few

217
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,420
high probability entry points if you

218
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,160
missed a very low point it's not a

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,399
problem look at the four hour chart with

220
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,980
all of the monthly weekly daily PD

221
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,620
arrays obviously in the four hour to

222
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,060
keep this chart clean

223
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,880
I didn't add the four hour PD arrays you

224
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,700
can add them and you'll have more detail

225
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,560
on this chart and you'll have more

226
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,959
insights to trade off of but to keep

227
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,060
things germane and only on the higher

228
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,160
time frame we're just using the PD

229
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,019
arrays from the monthly weekly and daily

230
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,500
levels

231
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,399
and the subsequent week

232
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,040
is seen here same scenario the market

233
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,200
trades down initially making the low of

234
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
the week and look at the response off of

235
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,899
the divider between the total

236
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,660
macro consolidation that we did and we

237
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,240
discussed in the beginning of lesson

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,339
number five for cable

239
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,899
that removing

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
that movement down into the the Midway

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,100
point or equilibrium of the overall

242
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,300
consolidation

243
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
that is a high probability level in

244
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,920
itself now if you don't understand how

245
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,700
to break a range down or grade a range

246
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,680
or Price swing you're going to miss

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
these types of moves so you have to

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,500
always look at the trading ranges that

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,600
the Market's trading in look at the

250
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
highest high and the lowest low in the

251
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,959
form of the bodies not the Wicks and

252
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,820
Define that and then once you have that

253
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,680
that's like your master blueprint if you

254
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,240
will and you start breaking that down

255
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,860
because the algorithm is going to work

256
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,260
within that range it's going to go back

257
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,140
to reference points based on time and

258
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,880
price where price is already traded

259
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,519
where it hasn't been traded to in

260
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,220
reference to time so

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,320
we're looking for that same move that

262
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,140
originated in

263
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,180
March 14th uh

264
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,480
going into the 15th that low formed in

265
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,339
cable

266
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,160
that was in a discount Market the second

267
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,680
week that shaded in yellow here sees us

268
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,240
reaching up into a halfway point of the

269
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,700
upper portion of the total range or in

270
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,100
other words half of the premium

271
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,800
range that we defined by the daily chart

272
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,060
in its larger trading range

273
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,700
it moves from one level of logical

274
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,339
discount to another level of logical

275
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,399
premium it's very discernible you can

276
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,019
clearly see it

277
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,240
just by just grazing over this chart

278
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,459
real quickly you're not going to get the

279
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,980
benefit of looking at Price like this if

280
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,480
you just if you don't study it basically

281
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,820
and see the reactions how price is

282
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,459
moving and gravitating towards how I've

283
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,160
broken down the range

284
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,260
they act like

285
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,019
um magnets if you will there's a

286
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,540
component to trading that people like to

287
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,700
put on a truck I and I used to use I

288
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,779
used to trade with it as well

289
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,000
I used to trade with it as well they

290
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,579
were called pivot Points and well they

291
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,959
still are called private points to be

292
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,060
honest but they came from the four

293
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,279
Traders and and pit Traders where they

294
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,660
would do calculations based on the high

295
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,720
and the low and and adding specific uh

296
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,760
measurements to get the projected highs

297
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
and lows and supposed resistance now

298
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
that was like a self-fulfilling prophecy

299
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,640
but when you look at the the grades of a

300
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,000
trading range or a price swing it helps

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,459
you really discern where the market has

302
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,800
its highest probable support or

303
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,079
resistance without really having a

304
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,540
logical old reference point like when we

305
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,880
do support and resistance we look for an

306
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,740
old level we draw it out in time and

307
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,240
just because it did something back then

308
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
we expected to do it again in the future

309
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,740
and you've seen how that's worked out in

310
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,660
your own trading it doesn't have any

311
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,180
consistency so you have to look at what

312
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,800
the institutions are doing and look

313
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,899
behind the scenes and what's the

314
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,300
institutional order flow so if we can

315
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,000
grade A price swing from a premium or

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,519
discount measure we can see the market

317
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,300
was clearly in a discount range in the

318
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,480
14th of March so by trading down there

319
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
trading into the fair value you got to

320
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,720
shaded in green the natural response

321
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,060
with BC price trade higher it does that

322
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,700
and then it starts finding new levels of

323
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,980
support institutionally based

324
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,740
based on a discount

325
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,839
PD array in other words we're looking

326
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
for reasons to support price it could be

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,139
in the form of a bullish order block

328
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,980
fair value Gap a breaker a mitigation

329
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,880
block it could be a old low or an old

330
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,139
High

331
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,200
once broken now turning support all

332
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,860
those ideas okay lend well to supporting

333
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,720
price going higher and you you start

334
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,500
working towards a premium Market intra

335
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,560
week the more we get closer to another

336
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,500
level of Premium based on defining your

337
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,959
range and defining your price swing

338
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,459
and Grading it

339
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,260
you know it's breaking it down into

340
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,940
quadrants and then splitting in half

341
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,980
when the market reaches for these

342
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,620
measures okay it's almost like a mile

343
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,600
marker for the algorithm it will reach

344
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,959
for it and then give the participants at

345
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,120
the bank opportunities to facilitate

346
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,279
trade if it

347
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,220
breaks through a level okay and it

348
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,720
trades right through it you know that

349
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
it's going to most likely reach for the

350
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,500
next level up okay very rarely do you

351
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,200
see any Midway points uh between the the

352
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,700
grades that I've already given you here

353
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,380
in or it's the way we Define the market

354
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,779
breaking it down and cutting the the

355
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,399
ranges in half

356
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,139
the way we did that in lesson five

357
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,700
that's the same levels we're seeing here

358
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
so I didn't add anything new except for

359
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,880
the shading of the yellow the box I'm

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
just giving you the context behind the

361
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,940
market and why it was doing what it was

362
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,500
doing now clearly obviously one would

363
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,360
say okay well this is obvious you know

364
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
armchair quarterbacking it's a hindsight

365
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,500
but if you go through the charts it's

366
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,720
the same thing happening almost all the

367
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,019
time so by having the theory behind why

368
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,420
it's doing what it's doing we can look

369
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,040
for how

370
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,600
each week

371
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,959
this same component or element to one

372
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,839
shot one kill will repeat itself

373
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,079
looking closer

374
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,540
looking closer

375
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,820
we can see that each week that the

376
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,720
market

377
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,240
we trade is going to seek to trade from

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
one PD array to another

379
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,199
it will trade from one quadrant to

380
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,540
another with the least resistance it can

381
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,579
move from premium to discount or

382
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,639
discount to premium Market valuation now

383
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,380
the determination of whether it's going

384
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,420
to move higher or lower is based on

385
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,920
where we're trading at at the time when

386
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,320
you're sitting in front of the charts if

387
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,000
we're in a premium Market it means we're

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
really pushed up and we are into a

389
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
logical area of where price has shown a

390
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,720
willingness to sell off before it's away

391
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,180
from its lowest levels of historical

392
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,160
buys or where old lows have formed

393
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,139
basically how we framed premium and

394
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,579
discount Works we've already taught in

395
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,899
this mentorship

396
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,839
but when we have the levels on our chart

397
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,360
and it's in a four hour basis it gives

398
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,420
us context it tells us how we can

399
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
anticipate the full weekly range because

400
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,620
these daily or in this case you know

401
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,720
four hours a weekly divider by hitting

402
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,600
control and tapping y you get these

403
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,060
vertical lines on mt4 what you'll end up

404
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,519
doing is each week before the market

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
starts trading on a Sunday and what you

406
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,820
want to do is just load up your four

407
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,279
hour chart have your PD arrays loaded on

408
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,240
there

409
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
and make notations on where you think

410
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,100
price May logically reach up to when

411
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,540
it's in a discount Market

412
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,000
or where it may reach down to when it's

413
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,160
in a premium Market

414
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,279
by looking at where the PD arrays are

415
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,380
in a four hour chart it's almost like

416
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,540
you can anticipate what the weekly range

417
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,800
will do

418
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,440
in a completed sense in order to what

419
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
the market looks like after the week

420
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,699
closes on Friday and in a good example

421
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,579
or exercise in this case would be to do

422
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,600
this every single week try to anticipate

423
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,940
what the weekly range will look like now

424
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,380
you're not going to get this all the

425
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,940
time it's not going to be perfect and

426
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,259
many times you're not going to be close

427
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,899
to it at all but what it will do is it

428
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,940
will help build your anticipatory price

429
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,280
skills which is necessary to start

430
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,980
seeing this stuff before it happens

431
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,540
we're trading in probabilities we're

432
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,299
looking at a statistical Edge that the

433
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,339
market if it's in a premium it's most

434
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,540
likely going to want to trade lower

435
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,059
where does it trade down to it's not

436
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,559
just looking for a support level it's

437
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,419
looking for an old area of institutional

438
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,900
order flow where was their old buying

439
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,240
where was their old institutional order

440
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,520
flow seen in the marketplace and it's

441
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
going to be in the form of a PD array

442
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,260
so we look at our PD array Matrix to

443
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,960
determine what are those PD arrays that

444
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,299
exist in your chart at the time and you

445
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,940
look at how reasonable it is for it to

446
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,919
reach down into or up into that level

447
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
between the two vertical lines

448
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,419
you only have Monday through Friday well

449
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,000
Sunday's opening until Friday so you

450
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,380
have an element of time that you have to

451
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,580
work within

452
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,640
so because it's relatively short term in

453
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
nature it's easy to predict where the

454
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,559
market may go between

455
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,960
a Monday and a Friday and you don't have

456
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,160
to have the highest high and you don't

457
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,780
have to have the lowest low you just

458
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,039
need to know what's the probable

459
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,260
Direction and what levels will it most

460
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,020
likely key off of that's the benefit of

461
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,820
using a four hour chart and using the

462
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,260
PDA arrays from the monthly weekly and

463
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
daily and

464
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,380
four hour if you want to have all that

465
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,419
on here but nonetheless if you key off a

466
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,299
daily weekly and monthly PD arrays on a

467
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,620
four hour chart you're going to get the

468
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,860
highest probable trade reactions and

469
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,900
that's where the institutions step in

470
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,179
now when you refine it down to a lower

471
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,980
time frame obviously in an hourly chart

472
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,840
you get more detail you get more

473
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,059
opportunities to you know reduce the

474
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,500
risk and you might get another

475
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,860
opportunity if you missed the overall

476
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,960
daily or weekly

477
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
PD array in other words if you missed

478
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,460
that entry it may give you one more shot

479
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,580
to get on it with an hourly chart but

480
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,559
it's better if you just train yourself

481
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,600
to work off of a four hour chart and

482
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
start to Envision

483
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,320
and kind of more or less predict what

484
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,460
the weekly range is going to look like

485
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,860
here's an example here where the market

486
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,320
trades down into the fair value Gap

487
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,020
we're in a deep discount Market

488
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,539
and for that week it trades up into a

489
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,320
bearish order block

490
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,059
the subsequent week we have the price

491
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,580
trading down into the equilibrium price

492
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,419
point

493
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,360
of the total macro range from the daily

494
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,600
chart that we showed in lesson five and

495
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,880
it also trades back down into an old

496
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
bullish order block from the previous

497
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,299
week

498
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,980
and then the market trades up and closes

499
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,780
in a fair value Gap

500
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,760
seeing back in February

501
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,059
now taking this information and refine

502
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,340
it even further down into a 60 Minute

503
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,320
chart you'll start to see a little bit

504
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,380
more definition in the market and

505
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,600
looking closely you'll see that there

506
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,880
are many times you'll see Breakers and

507
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,340
mitigation blocks that didn't exist on

508
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,600
your four hour chart

509
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,860
so

510
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
anything less than a one hour chart when

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,980
you're looking for one shot one kill

512
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,679
really reduces the effectiveness because

513
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,980
what you're looking for is that impulse

514
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,039
price swing to help facilitate the

515
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,600
weekly range or complete the weekly

516
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,520
range anything less than a 60 Minute

517
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,760
chart you're really just day trading or

518
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,799
you're scalping

519
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,000
so that's why you want to focus

520
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,280
primarily on a four hour chart for the

521
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,740
the levels you want to key off of but

522
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,480
once you get down into an hourly chart

523
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,340
then you can break the market down into

524
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,820
a day by day basis and then we can start

525
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,160
incorporating day of week phenomenon so

526
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,299
if we're looking for a bullish Market

527
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,120
moving from a discount Market to a

528
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,940
premium each week

529
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,620
what we're looking essentially for is

530
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,940
the low of the week to form between

531
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,919
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday they are

532
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,140
the highest probable trading days in

533
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,360
this environment so the criteria is in a

534
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,640
trending environment we expect price to

535
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,020
trade from a discount to a premium in

536
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,000
this case we would reverse everything if

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,860
we were expecting lower prices from a

538
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,840
premium down to a discount Market

539
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,880
but we have all our PD arrays on our

540
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,919
chart and our levels and our quadrants

541
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,840
on so we have all of our natural support

542
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,299
resistance which is the grading of all

543
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,500
of

544
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,260
the levels that we did in lesson five

545
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,480
and then incorporating the actual PD

546
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,600
arrays in reference to the if the data

547
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,360
range in the last 60 20 and 40 days

548
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,880
the low of the week in bullish

549
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,740
conditions in trending environments we

550
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,240
look for the Monday Tuesday or Wednesday

551
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,980
low to form

552
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,799
in the first week we see here Monday

553
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,720
Tuesday and Wednesday the low forms on

554
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,539
Tuesday notice the low forms off of a

555
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,140
logical PD array in a discount fashion

556
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,940
trades down to a fair value Gap that's

557
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,820
seen on the daily chart so price trades

558
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,760
up creates a high that's slightly higher

559
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,280
than Monday's high on Wednesday and then

560
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,799
breaks through it and creates a higher

561
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
high for the week so the intra week high

562
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,299
is formed on Wednesday notice on

563
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,220
Thursday it trades down into the fair

564
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,360
value Gap

565
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,760
into a mitigation block also from

566
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,039
Wednesday's intradays trading and the

567
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
market does what another impulse print

568
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,700
price selling higher all the way into

569
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,679
Thursday goes into consolidation and

570
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,720
then Friday it has a small little Judas

571
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,240
swing trades down into equilibrium

572
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,580
and then expands on the upside

573
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,539
going into the close

574
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,220
the second week or subsequent week in

575
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,640
our case study we see the low forms on

576
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,740
Monday after it hits the equilibrium

577
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,919
price point of the overall macro

578
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,020
consolidation as we defined in lesson

579
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,400
number five

580
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,559
and then Tuesday we have a read trade

581
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,380
back down into that same old low so we

582
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,539
had another retouch of

583
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,179
the equilibrium price point and then

584
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,100
acceleration on the upside

585
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,720
and then Wednesday we have another

586
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,900
opportunity to get long trading off of a

587
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,299
breaker that's formed on that week's

588
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,520
Monday so we have Wednesdays trading

589
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,860
trading down into a breaker

590
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
uh

591
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,260
a bullish breaker

592
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
formed on Monday's high Wednesday's low

593
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,340
is

594
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,080
formed off of that

595
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,320
trades higher and then notice also while

596
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,539
we had slightly bullishness on Thursday

597
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,500
and then a relatively flat close on that

598
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,240
week's Friday

599
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,900
um

600
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,940
one of the things I want you to see is

601
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,600
when we go through this com this process

602
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
you're going to quickly learn that

603
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,580
typically the weekly ranges they have a

604
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,320
30 to 50 percent of the weekly range

605
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
completed between Monday to Wednesday in

606
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,539
other words by London close on Wednesday

607
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,299
30 to 50 percent generally the range is

608
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,940
completed so what does that mean

609
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,260
if we have the willingness to to look

610
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,179
for Longs only we expect the market from

611
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,120
a discount to a premium to unfold for

612
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,620
the week

613
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,260
if we do not capture the long

614
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,659
either Monday Tuesday or Wednesday and

615
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,960
it has happened to potentially form and

616
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,419
we've seen some price actions that

617
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,059
suggest that that Weekly range is going

618
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,280
to be up close or bullish as we expected

619
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,080
but we didn't get to trade on

620
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,940
uh maybe we're stopped out maybe we

621
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,380
missed it all together

622
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,120
or maybe we were wrong and we found out

623
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,740
later in the week that oh yeah this is

624
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,580
probably what's going to happen now

625
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
because that's going to happen as well

626
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,780
uh you may expect something to unfold uh

627
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,100
for the week and then it doesn't do that

628
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,480
and you have to be flexible and change

629
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,039
gears and we're going to talk about that

630
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
in lesson number seven but

631
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,200
if you've missed the Monday through

632
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
Wednesday phenomenon

633
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,220
and the Market's already traded just

634
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,960
know that

635
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,900
it's important not to get PIP drunk

636
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,720
trying to get a lion's portion of a move

637
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,419
by Friday's close

638
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
because the weekly range may end up

639
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,980
being smaller or less volatile than

640
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,960
you've anticipated so just know that

641
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,840
generally a third or half of the weekly

642
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,820
range is done by Wednesday's London

643
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,780
close

644
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,640
and don't expect a massive move higher

645
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,220
or lower in in the last two days of the

646
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,299
trading week

647
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,520
generally if you get an explosive move

648
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,860
usually on Tuesday or Wednesday Thursday

649
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,600
May see a little bit of following follow

650
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,340
through but then Friday has either

651
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,320
retracement or does what you see here in

652
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,120
the second week where it's basically in

653
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,500
neutral close it doesn't really do

654
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,659
anything more stunning than what was

655
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,080
seen in Thursday or Wednesday's Trading

656
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,480
so we're going to build on the idea of

657
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,720
this and incorporate how to know when

658
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,039
there's going to be an inch or week

659
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,020
reversal

660
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,580
so until next lesson I wish you good

661
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,600
luck and good Trading
