1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,719
welcome back folks this is lesson three

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,940
in the January 2017 content for the ICT

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,500
mentorship

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm gonna be discussing how to use

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,199
inter-market analysis

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,699
okay our internet market analysis

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,719
presentation here is going to be

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,600
predominantly conceptualized thinking so

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
there's no charts here there's nothing

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,760
exciting okay but it's dry useful

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
information but it's very very dry so

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm going to warn you ahead of time so

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,640
if you're trying to do something apart

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,520
from 100 attention you want to see this

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,980
lesson for a time when you can focus on

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,960
the presentation very closely and take

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,320
notes

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
okay so World Markets are directly

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,399
linked to one another and it's probably

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,260
a common understanding but a lot of

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,180
people don't realize exactly how they're

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,380
related what relationships exists what

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,119
correlations if the if you will exist

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,920
between certain Market asset classes

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,619
certain groups in certain sectors

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,439
uh there's closely related uh

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
correlations between some unexpected

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
markets where without having a global or

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,299
macro understanding of what they do as a

30
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,580
country in terms of exports you wouldn't

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,740
understand what the relationships would

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,900
be without having that information or

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,979
that study behind you

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,900
so understanding them as a collective

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,600
whole or how these markets relate with

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,520
one another will Aid in your analysis

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,119
and now since the January content is

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,119
predominantly focused on 100 long-term

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,399
analysis our Focus needs to be on the

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,119
relationships of these four groups

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,280
the four major groups of inter-market

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,220
analysis are as follows

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,280
to bond in interest rate markets

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,920
the commodity markets

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
the stock market

46
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
and the currencies Market

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,660
all four of these groups together are

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,360
closely related with one another now

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,940
they don't move lock step to one another

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,060
there's not a Five Points higher for

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,800
bonds therefore it's going to be five

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,959
points in another asset class or group

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,700
that's going to move in relationship to

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,280
that movement it doesn't work like that

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
since we're looking at long-term macro

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
perspectives and Analysis Concepts

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,599
there's going to be a certain measure of

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,060
lead and lag time for some of these

59
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,340
Market relationships and for some of you

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,780
that's going to turn you off right away

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,360
because you're used to knowing this is

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,560
what it's supposed to do and therefore

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm going to expect it right now and

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,580
when you're being a long-term

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,620
Trader or using long-term analysis

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,420
there's going to be a certain measure of

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,000
lead time and lag time before you

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
actually see the marketplace reflect

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,660
what would be expected in terms of the

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,180
analysis Concepts

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,519
but the benefit of this is and this is

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,980
what I have gravitated towards you can

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,860
use an economist Theory which is instead

74
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
of going through fundamental data

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,819
looking at things like CPI or employment

76
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,980
trends or all these fundamental data

77
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,300
points that are released throughout the

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,760
month every single month that's just too

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
much information for me to digest and I

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,599
don't ever claim to have the mental

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,580
capacity to understand it all in fact

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,739
I've said many times in all of my

83
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:32,940
teachings that I don't believe that

84
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,640
there is a realistic way of staying

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,140
abreast of all those types of things if

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,940
you're wading through all that data I

87
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,799
mean either you have to be a serious

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
data nut or

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
it to me it's over everyone's head you

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,640
just I just don't think it could be done

91
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
I'd love to meet someone that could do

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
it fundamentally improve beyond the

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,739
shadow of a doubt that they can use that

94
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,540
fundamental data to forecast future

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,000
prices okay that would be wonderful if I

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
could find that that would be something

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,299
I would probably add to my repertoire

98
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,340
but in my studies I've never been able

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,200
to really ascertain anyone to be able to

100
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,659
use that information and be able to

101
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,340
forecast with a great deal of

102
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,239
accuracy if you will

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,000
now even on a long term basis

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,199
because the markets are slow to come to

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
fruition these these Market moves take a

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,479
long time to develop and unfold in our

107
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,560
charts

108
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,780
it takes a great deal of patience and

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,520
while there's a lot of information to

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,780
Wade through if you go through it

111
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,639
fundamentally and using all those data

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,100
points and and data

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,020
to me if we just focus on these four

114
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,820
major groups it'll give us all the

115
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
insights that that data will ultimately

116
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,340
give give you a fundamentalist so what I

117
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,240
mean by that we're going to actually

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
break down some of the relationships as

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
we go through this mentorship

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,120
but in this teaching here I want to give

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,620
you kind of like an overview and some of

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,419
the things that I have picked up along

123
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,639
the way as a Trader that I like to focus

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,840
on when I'm looking at Market

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,620
relationships

126
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,400
all right so enter market analysis

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,740
overview now the four major groups for

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,139
the inter market analysis

129
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,660
the bond market and interest rate Market

130
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,120
bonds and stocks generally they move

131
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,160
together okay so if we're seeing a Bond

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,199
Market rally and it's the bond prices

133
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,060
not the yield okay so if we're looking

134
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,240
at the treasury bond market and the bond

135
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,220
prices are rallying higher in an uptrend

136
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,560
generally that's going to be helpful and

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,919
supportive of a bull market for stocks

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
conversely if you see the bomb the bond

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,400
market in a bear Market it's been

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
trending lower it's going to be very

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,820
hard for stocks to Rally in that

142
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,440
environment now it doesn't mean that it

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,500
can't rally okay it just means that that

144
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,720
underlying trend of the bond market

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,180
moving lower is going to have a effect

146
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,060
and weight on that stock market rally

147
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,680
and eventually you're going to have to

148
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
pay the piper and that stock market's

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,740
going to have to correct and get back in

150
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,020
alignment with the overall trend of the

151
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,199
bond market

152
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,600
Commodities are a market group that

153
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,060
moved opposite to the bond prices so if

154
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,520
we see bonds moving higher Commodities

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
will be moving lower in relationship to

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,900
that move and

157
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,380
our third Group stock market stocks move

158
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,900
together with bonds as we said you have

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,780
to constantly refer to the market

160
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,180
indices for stocks and the bond market

161
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,340
or if you're a stock Trader you can use

162
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,080
the information that's gleaned from the

163
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,419
bond market preferably if you're going

164
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,240
to be a stock market Trader you want to

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,580
be looking at the bond market as a

166
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,340
indicator that you have underlying

167
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,840
strength in the bond market so if bond

168
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,819
prices are going higher and your buyer

169
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,220
of stocks then you can go in with a

170
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,419
great deal of confidence that you have

171
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,639
the fundamentals behind you that lower

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,199
interest rates with the bond prices

173
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,139
rallying stocks like that if bonds are

174
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,300
trading lower

175
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,220
stocks don't like higher interest rates

176
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,360
and that's what's going to happen if you

177
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
see bond prices dropping that means the

178
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,479
interest rate yields are actually

179
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,360
increasing bonds do not like a high

180
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,440
interest rate environment

181
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
and currencies obviously are influenced

182
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,600
by Commodities so the effects of export

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,800
sales and production in relationship to

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,240
certain Commodities that's going to have

185
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,400
a direct impact on specific Commodities

186
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,020
and specific currencies

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,819
okay we're gonna look at their first

188
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,979
relationship here as the U.S dollar

189
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,680
versus commodities

190
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,539
okay we're going to look at this as a

191
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,940
inversely related relationship in other

192
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,380
words they move opposites to each other

193
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,599
that means if the dollar Index is moving

194
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,639
One Direction the commodity in as a

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,620
group as a whole Commodities will be

196
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,300
moving the opposite direction

197
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,580
so for example specifically US dollar

198
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,340
Index if it's trading higher Commodities

199
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,300
as a whole should be trending lower

200
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,979
and if the dollar Index is trending

201
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,500
lower or trading lower Commodities will

202
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,300
be doing the opposite and going higher

203
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
now when we're looking at Commodities

204
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
okay grains in agriculturals are very

205
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,160
export sensitive so if we have a

206
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,139
strong dollar that's going to diminish

207
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,720
the desire or demand for exports in the

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
form of grains and livestock

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
agricultural markets in other words

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
grains and meats

211
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,319
and if the US dollar Index shows

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
weakness that instills an increase or

213
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,560
demand for grain in agricultural exports

214
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,440
US dollar Index if it's going higher or

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,740
rallying this is also seen with stocks

216
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,000
and bonds moving up because it's

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
supportive of

218
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,180
the stock and bond market going higher

219
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,519
US dollar Index if it moves lower this

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,279
is seen with support with stocks and

221
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,140
bonds both trending lower as well

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,519
US dollar Index if it's moving higher

223
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,440
this is going to be seen with commodity

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,800
currencies moving lower

225
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,140
in dollar Index if it's moving down it's

226
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,480
going to see a commodity currency Rally

227
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,540
or movement higher

228
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,160
and the way you measure this is you

229
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,339
could look at the US dollar Index versus

230
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,740
the crb index which is commodity

231
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,600
research Bureau index you can get that

232
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,180
information on the internet at

233
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,440
crbtrader.com I'll give you some notes

234
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,300
in the PDF file

235
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,920
that would include more information on

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
all the things that you'll hear about in

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,260
this presentation

238
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,700
okay the next one is the bonds versus

239
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,100
commodities

240
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,779
and bonds and commodities have an

241
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,339
inverse relationship as well that means

242
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,399
they again move opposite to one another

243
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,140
now if the bond prices or the treasury

244
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,839
bond market okay moves up or trades

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,880
higher that generally is going to have a

246
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,420
impact on Commodities moving lower

247
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,459
and if bonds are trending or trading

248
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,440
lower that's going to allow Commodities

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,980
to Rally

250
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,399
now when we're looking at the

251
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,140
relationship between bonds or treasury

252
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,779
bonds 30 year treasury nodes

253
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,480
and the commodity Market what we're

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,680
really focusing on is inflationary

255
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,980
impact so if we're following along and

256
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,140
looking for signs of inflation it's

257
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,680
going to be noticed in the markets that

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,720
are Commodities Commodities are the

259
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,480
leading indication for inflationary

260
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
environments

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
so what's the lead in lag time in a

262
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,260
change or long-term basis for the bond

263
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,000
and commodity relationships because

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,980
we're dealing with a long-term macro

265
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,800
perspective on these two assets

266
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,260
it can sometimes take 6 to 12 months

267
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,380
before you see a change in trend on the

268
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,700
relationship between the bonds and the

269
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,640
commodities now that means that

270
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,360
Commodities may turn up and bonds may

271
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
eventually turn lower as a result later

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,720
on or bonds may turn up and commodities

273
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,940
may turn lower later on as a result of

274
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,519
that it doesn't happen lock step for

275
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,320
step it doesn't give you that immediate

276
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,839
feedback because it's long-term macro

277
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,120
fundamentals are behind these big moves

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
especially when we're dealing with these

279
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,120
two asset classes in the relationship

280
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,540
basis so it takes a long time sometimes

281
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,640
for the effects of interest rate changes

282
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,519
or supply and demand factors that are

283
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,980
really weighed in the consumption or

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,420
production of Commodities as a whole

285
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,420
now treasury bonds or t-bonds versus the

286
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,279
crb index is what you'll be using to

287
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,959
measure the relationship between the two

288
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,480
but the crb index let me add this to

289
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,360
your notes it's very heavily weighted

290
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,100
with the Agricultural and grain markets

291
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,920
so when we look at crb index it's very

292
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,260
very heavy on

293
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,700
soybean prices wheat prices corn prices

294
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,940
cattle prices hog prices okay so you

295
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,079
have to keep that in mind when you're

296
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,420
looking at crb index

297
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,260
foreign

298
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,000
you want to use the Goldman Sachs

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,579
commodity index when you're looking for

300
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,980
the energy focused side of the

301
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,180
marketplace in other words it's heavily

302
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,040
weighted on energy

303
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,019
and you want to weigh that against the

304
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,060
bond market

305
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,160
and the Goldman Sachs industrial metal

306
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,740
index and this is

307
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,760
um for focus on global Trends and

308
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,519
it's not meant for metals like silver

309
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,800
Palladium platinum gold okay these

310
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,899
metals are like zinc tin copper aluminum

311
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,540
they're Industrial Metals so they're

312
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,440
heavily sensitive to Global Trends and

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
big

314
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,339
sensitive tendencies in the marketplace

315
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,440
around the world where if there's a big

316
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,660
demand for Industrial Metals

317
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,820
then you'll see it in this index if

318
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,500
there's not there's also going to be

319
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,480
evidence of that in this index as well

320
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,480
and in summary bond yields when they're

321
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,180
going higher that would be seen with the

322
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,420
bond market going lower or the bond

323
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,040
price is going lower that means bond

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,660
yields are increasing and that's going

325
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,740
to push Commodities up

326
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,300
and my bond yields are going down that

327
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,880
means the treasury bond market prices

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,579
are going higher that's going to push

329
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,779
Commodities down

330
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,680
okay we're going to look at the bonds

331
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,320
versus the stock market now

332
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,000
this has a positive correlation that

333
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,079
means they move in the same direction

334
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,740
and obviously that means when the bond

335
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,260
market is trending higher or trading

336
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,480
higher that's going to provide strength

337
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,019
for stocks and support for it

338
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,760
name of the bond markets trending or

339
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,920
moving lower this will have an effect

340
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,600
that's bearish on stocks

341
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,740
and the bond market or the treasury bond

342
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,620
or 30-year Benchmark acts as a leading

343
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,120
indicator for stock Direction

344
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,740
the lead in lag time in changes for

345
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,740
long-term trends again can be 6 to 12

346
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,200
months in duration that means what you

347
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,320
see going on in the long-term trends of

348
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,720
the bond market may take a little bit of

349
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,139
time up to yes I say a year before you

350
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,760
see these long-term trends start to

351
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,139
manifest themselves in the stock market

352
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,120
now there's one caveat with this okay

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,399
when there's deflationary periods that

354
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,500
means when prices are decreasing and

355
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,240
this is a rarity it doesn't happen a lot

356
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,540
we actually saw this in the latter part

357
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,920
of 1998 it was it was indicated in the

358
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,300
in the markets that there was

359
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,880
potentially that happening but when this

360
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,339
occurs the bonds perform very well

361
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,839
because you're actually seeing the

362
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,120
interest rate markets collapsing

363
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
but with bonds going up that's usually

364
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,740
seen in a in a deflationary period

365
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,199
you're usually seeing bonds going higher

366
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,920
the bond prices or treasury bonds price

367
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,019
going higher with stocks going lower and

368
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,000
commodities going down

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,620
like I said it's a rarity that ever

370
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,620
happens but usually you would not ever

371
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,000
really going to see a deflation appear

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,519
that I can imagine anytime soon

373
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,839
okay finally we're gonna look at some

374
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,959
key inter-market relationships

375
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,519
okay when you're bullish dollar Index

376
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,380
you're gonna be expecting bearishness on

377
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
gold

378
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,740
bullishness on gold you're gonna be

379
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,720
expecting Aussie New Zealand to be

380
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,199
bullish because of their nature as a

381
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,980
gold exporter

382
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,360
when oil is bullish you're gonna be

383
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,760
bearish on U.S CAD

384
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,860
uh because of the Canadian export

385
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,139
leadership and oil exports

386
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Dow when it's up or bullish that's knee

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,720
K index is bullish as well

388
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,519
is it direct relationship to the Dow

389
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
Nikkei

390
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,959
and when Nikkei index is down uh that's

391
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,820
going to be bearish for the US dollar

392
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,220
versus Japanese Yen pair

393
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,980
and generally when yields are down or

394
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,019
bearish that's going to be bearish for

395
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,579
the currency

396
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,000
because money seeks yield

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,459
and when gold is bearish that's usually

398
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,860
bullish for US dollar versus CAD

399
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,660
and finally uh by having an

400
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,220
understanding of all these relationships

401
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,339
as a whole conceptually

402
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,079
they give you confirmation of long-term

403
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,120
analysis uh the relationships between

404
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,300
all of them if you're seeing a number of

405
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,000
these things in alignment with your

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,660
long-term analysis you're probably on to

407
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,880
the right path you know what you're

408
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,259
looking at the right direction in the

409
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,959
marketplace rarely will you see a wide

410
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,940
disparity with all these things not

411
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,279
aligning if you have a good sample size

412
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,839
of some of these things in alignment

413
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,300
generally your long-term analysis is

414
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,800
probably going to be

415
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,259
true to form it'll probably pan out in

416
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,579
the long-term Direction like you think

417
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,300
it will the problem is timing long-term

418
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,240
Trend trading or long-term analysis and

419
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,720
timing are just in my opinion some of

420
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,880
the hardest things to time because it's

421
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,579
hard to get traders to focus on allowing

422
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,740
a little bit more movement against their

423
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,280
underlying entry point what I mean by

424
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,900
that is because you're trading on higher

425
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,799
time frame charts it's

426
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,040
probably because of your your home life

427
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,280
your time constraints that keep you from

428
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,580
being able to trade with a lower time

429
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,740
frame entry so you're forced many times

430
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
to trade off of a daily chart and if

431
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,980
you're going to execute off of a daily

432
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,179
chart you're going to have to permit

433
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,760
yourself a great deal of movement

434
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,460
against you in terms of a stop loss

435
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,520
because your ranges are a lot larger and

436
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,039
you have to require a lot more time but

437
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
even with that said if you're going to

438
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,500
be using these points of information and

439
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,980
relationships with inter-market analysis

440
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,020
it's going to help you in any in all

441
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,880
facets of trading regardless of your day

442
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,559
trading scalping short-term trading

443
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,240
swing trading you know or position

444
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,940
trading and long-term scope it's

445
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,280
beneficial to know these things and it

446
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
helps build probabilities in your favor

447
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,020
and again nothing in here

448
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,380
equates to 100 a surety uh you know

449
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,240
there's absolutely no guarantee that

450
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,539
nothing out there can't change on drop

451
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,220
of a hat which you think you see in the

452
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,120
charts

453
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,620
could always be wrong because there's

454
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,480
always a human element that's always

455
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,580
involved here then the analyst is you

456
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,280
but I think if you were to spend some

457
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,840
time going over the relationships that's

458
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,440
gone through this presentation if you

459
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,660
spend that time look at it on a macro

460
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,460
level you'll see that there's a great

461
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,799
deal of value in knowing these

462
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,220
relationships and because they are

463
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,559
leading you to a long-term Trend

464
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,100
following directional bias using higher

465
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,960
time frame daily charts

466
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,380
it will give you confidence as a Trader

467
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,820
to know that you're trading with the

468
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,260
underlying fundamentals and you don't

469
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,900
really require all of that time and

470
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,620
energy and and diligence needed to go

471
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,780
through fundamental data the

472
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,360
relationships between these markets as

473
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,640
we outlined in this presentation will

474
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,220
take you to the same outcome that

475
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,440
fundamental data will give you so just

476
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
like the relationships here will

477
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,860
sometimes lag

478
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,440
that same lagging effect that happens in

479
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,059
the fundamental data I knew this much

480
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,220
about fundamental data just because the

481
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,020
fundamentals suggest something should be

482
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,520
bullish doesn't mean tomorrow it's going

483
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,600
to go straight up

484
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,640
okay there's going to be time that has

485
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,919
to be built in for that market to start

486
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,720
building in a bullish tenancy and then

487
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,059
it'll start to move higher but long-term

488
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,640
macro Trends okay you can see when

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
they're starting and shifting and moving

490
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,539
into place by using the information that

491
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,220
we shared in this presentation so again

492
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,980
study it believe me when I tell you the

493
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,900
information in this is worth its weight

494
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,200
in gold it's not something that is sexy

495
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,360
it's not a lot of charts where I can

496
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,520
show you Judas swings and patterns and

497
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,100
all this and that but it's real

498
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
information that has a direct

499
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,240
relationship to how the markets work as

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,080
a whole

501
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
how they tie together and it keeps you

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,320
out of having to look at fundamental

503
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,000
data and if there's anything else that

504
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,179
you know you can't associate with in

505
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,240
terms of value that's enough there's so

506
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,320
many things out there you would be

507
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,120
wasting my opinion your time you're

508
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,620
going through all that data and when you

509
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,820
could just simply see what price is

510
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,260
telling you because price in all these

511
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,720
asset classes together as a whole will

512
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,980
reflect what the fundamentals are

513
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,480
actually doing because trained

514
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,340
accredited staff at these big

515
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,840
institutions Banks producers

516
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,940
manufacturers and exporters they're

517
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,860
using that real fundamental data they

518
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,120
have people that are trained accredited

519
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,799
and they're able to use the information

520
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,039
to forecast Trends in sales and and

521
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,840
consumption all those types of things

522
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,820
and they make their business plans

523
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,760
around those those data points

524
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
I can't keep abreast of all that stuff

525
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,299
there's too many things that's going on

526
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,340
in my own personal life let alone

527
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
you know to keep up with all the

528
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,340
ever-changing things in the marketplace

529
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,039
so if I can look at the price of these

530
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,419
asset classes and the relationship

531
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,179
between the all of all four of them in

532
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,160
concert with one another I will just

533
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,080
like you will come to the conclusion of

534
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,760
what the geopolitical macro Trend and

535
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,400
there I say it fundamental perspective

536
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
is on the market as a macro perspective

537
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,480
Trader

538
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,340
until next time wish good luck and good

539
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,640
Trading
