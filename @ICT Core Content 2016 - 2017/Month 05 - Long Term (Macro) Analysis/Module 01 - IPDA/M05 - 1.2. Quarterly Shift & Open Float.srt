1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,279
okay folks we are looking at

2
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
lesson 1.2 of the long-term analysis

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
implementing macro analysis quarterly

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,560
shifts and open float

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
okay we're going to be talking about

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,079
open float on this teaching

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,920
okay

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,239
the quarterly shift

9
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
with open float

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
and let's first start by defining what

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
is

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,840
open

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,760
float the open float is the current open

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,560
interest above and below current market

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
price

16
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
now this is going to be in the form of

17
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
pending buy orders in other words buy

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
stops that are resting above old highs

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,759
or it could be just resting above market

20
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
price doesn't have to be old highs

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
and

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
sell orders

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
it could be

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
below the market price by very little

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,079
bit in terms of pips or could be below

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
significant lows

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
there are

28
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,240
open interest in the form of

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
sell stops for entry orders

30
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,920
and sell stops for collapsing long

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
positions

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
and there are buy stops to get along and

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
then buy stops to protect short

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
positions

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
all of those

36
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
are equating to

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
open float

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
it's the total open interest of the

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,560
players that are in

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
the market now or hope to be

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
depending on where price goes relative

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
to those standing orders

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
okay when open float is used

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
to determine buy side liquidity

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
shorts use protective buy stops above

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
the last bearish shift

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
buy stops above short-term highs that

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
could be in the form of

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,319
a weekly high or a monthly high

50
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
five stops above the highest high in the

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
last three months

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
buy stops above the current six-month

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
high

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,920
and buy stops above the current 12-month

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,720
high

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
now don't be discouraged by hearing

57
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,720
these numbers because

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,239
you can be

59
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
really close to

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
the 12-month high for a long period of

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
time and never really get to it

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
um

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
when i first remember reading about this

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
type of idea the range for the 12-month

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
high and low

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
i thought to myself you know it takes 12

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,680
months to get back to that level and

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
that just shows how myopic my viewpoint

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
was when i first started trading

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
the 12 month high and low you can be

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
inside that range for a long time near

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,879
the high or the low it doesn't take that

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,280
long to get to it so some of the new

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
traders that usually

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
send me emails they ask me how often

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
do i trade 12-month highs and lows well

77
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,720
you could see a 12-month high or low

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
pretty quickly yeah it depends on what

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
the range is in your market

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
the same thing is said for a six-month

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
high

82
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
the one we're going to focus on here

83
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,879
primarily is the buy stops above the

84
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
highest high in the last three months

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
because we're looking at the quarterly

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,680
shift

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
that's going to be a very

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
significant price level

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
where buy stops will be resting

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
so every three months you want to be

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
noting where that high is

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,799
and there's going to be buy stops

93
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
definitely most likely getting targeted

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,839
if we have a market structure shift

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
bush and they're going to be aiming for

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
those buy stops above the three-month

97
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
highs any run buy stops above a

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
short-term high which is a monthly high

99
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
or a weekly high

100
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
that's going to give us a strong

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
prognostication for short-term

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
volatility as well

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,919
when we're looking at the sell side of

104
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
the liquidity

105
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
long to use protective cell stops under

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
the last bullish shift

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
cell stops below short-term lows

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
that can be in the form of a

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
weekly low or a monthly low

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
sell slots below the lowest low in the

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,040
last three months

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
sell slots below the current six-month

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
low

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
and finally sell stops below the current

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
12-month low

116
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,320
now one of the questions i get a lot and

117
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,039
i get it actually sent to me by

118
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,919
email even in the free

119
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
members area from my website and on

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
youtube

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
when i talk about running stops or if i

122
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,400
talk about turtle soup

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
false breaks above old highs or false

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
breaks below no low

125
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,520
the question always comes up is how do i

126
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,479
know

127
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,280
if

128
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
the market's going to

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
stop just right above old high or below

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,400
and low and then reverse or

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
keep on going

132
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
and i'm going to teach you

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
the ideas that i use to get to that

134
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840
conclusion uh what what gives me the

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,120
conviction that builds the confidence

136
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
on believing that it's just going to

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,280
punch above an old high and probably not

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
continue going higher not by much in

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
other words

140
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
and then retrace and probably offer a

141
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,440
shorting opportunity the same thing is

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
re reverse for

143
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
buying an old low once it's been

144
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,199
violated

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
okay

146
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
this chart is basically outlining the

147
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
same

148
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,960
levels that we had for the quarterly

149
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
shifts and every three months the

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
intervals are shown here

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
i kept the majority of the vertical

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
lines off i just use those segments to

153
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
delineate what those

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
reference points would still be relative

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
to date

156
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,080
and i want you to take a look at this

157
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
chart for a minute focus and study on it

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
and if you can pause the video for a

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,759
couple minutes

160
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,160
and note significant price highs and

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
lows

162
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
obviously you can see the one that's

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
here

164
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,880
and the low down here

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
so we have two

166
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
pretty significant runs above an old

167
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,919
high

168
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,800
and below an old low

169
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,440
i want you to draw your attention to

170
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
this

171
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
short-term low here

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
when price traded below that low

173
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
that was a break in market structure

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
okay so we had a

175
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,160
market shift

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
below that low

177
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
and the market continued trading all the

178
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
way down until it got to the 105

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,240
30 level whenever we see the bearish

180
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
shift lower

181
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,759
in price

182
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,319
your eyes need to go right to

183
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
the high it just came from

184
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
because on a daily chart

185
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
that's going to have a lot of liquidity

186
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
above it

187
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,360
that liquidity is in the form of

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
a liquidity pool

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
for buy stops

190
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,120
the folks that were fortunate enough to

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,319
be short

192
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,840
from that old high trading down into 105

193
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,319
34

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
their position would have

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,799
a run on the buy stops that's residing

196
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
holding on to a long term position now

197
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
you're probably asking yourself

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
what retail trader in their right mind

199
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
would have a buy stop on a short held on

200
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
that long

201
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
just to see it kamali back up there and

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
get knocked out

203
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
well

204
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,600
again the market's not trading against

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
the retail traders it's trading against

206
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,399
the large

207
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
liquidity offered by the big funds

208
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
because funds are traditionally

209
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
long-term trend following traders

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
these reference points on the daily time

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,200
frame are going to be salient to

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,160
understanding how open float has a big

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,200
impact

214
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
on where future price movements are

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
going to take you

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
as you can see here after creating a low

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
of 1.0534

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
market does in fact have one more market

219
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
structure shift

220
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
and sends price higher pay attention to

221
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
the

222
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
quarterly shift markers that we have

223
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
here

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
every three months

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,000
there is a significant run on liquidity

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
the move off of the 105 34 level has a

227
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
break in market structure

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
then you can see the

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
subsequent retracement back to the short

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
term high

231
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
and then price rallies away

232
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
fills in the liquidity void

233
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
from october

234
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
retraces back down

235
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,040
into the 108 60 level

236
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
then rallies again

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
then ultimately making a run

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
up for the buy stops above the 1

239
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,320
15

240
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
big figure

241
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,000
that market structure break there

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
bullishly

243
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,519
is the catalyst that sends the market

244
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
higher to make the stops

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
above 115 big figure

246
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
targeted

247
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
below that low

248
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,560
there's going to be a large liquidity

249
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
pool on the daily time frame again it's

250
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
not for retail traders it's going to be

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
for the large funds

252
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,839
because there was a significant

253
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,399
displacement among many months

254
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,320
about six months or so

255
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
the market rallied from

256
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
105 34

257
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,880
to 1 115 70s or thereabout

258
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
so it's a pretty significant move for

259
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,040
the euro dollar

260
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
there's going to be sell side liquidity

261
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,760
or

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
sell stops in the form of a liquidity

263
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,560
pool

264
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
below that low

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
you see price did in fact sweep down

266
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
there and grab that liquidity

267
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,800
neutralizing all the cell stops

268
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
so let's take a look at what takes place

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
and how we can use open float

270
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
and help answer some of the confusion

271
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,959
you have about why

272
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,880
the market should be expected to go a

273
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,959
certain level and then retrace or

274
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,079
reverse

275
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,399
and how we can look forward to one side

276
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,800
of the market being predominantly

277
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,560
controlled and staving off any

278
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
continuation after the move blows

279
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,640
through an old high or below an old well

280
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
as you see here we have a short-term

281
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,200
high here rate before

282
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,279
the market runs through that that

283
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,000
retracement back down into

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
the 107 50s

285
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,959
the buy stops that would be resting

286
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
above that high they're targeted and the

287
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
market runs right through that and also

288
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
fills in a liquidity void to the left

289
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
from october

290
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
then the market retraces

291
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
deeper and then we have a short-term

292
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
height that was created by that rally

293
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,839
above taking the buy stops

294
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,560
out that short-term high eventually gets

295
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
ran out as well

296
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
making a run on the buy stops that will

297
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
be resting above that now what buy

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
stocks will be wrestling about that

299
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
people that want to sell short

300
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
every time price makes a

301
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
impulse price swing

302
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
there's always invariably going to be

303
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
orders that want to be selling there and

304
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
they're going to be sometimes short

305
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,720
positions

306
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
funds will go in and start working their

307
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
positions in early

308
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
and sometimes they get knocked out and

309
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
that's what's happening here many times

310
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,639
you're seeing that same

311
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,800
phenomenon you end up going through it's

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,079
just going through

313
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
a larger scope in terms of

314
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,839
order size

315
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
and finally making a run on that 115 big

316
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
figure

317
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
clearing out the buy stops above the

318
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
previous october high

319
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,360
now i'm going to draw your attention to

320
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
how do you know when the market's going

321
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
to reach for one side of the liquidity

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
or the other

323
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
notice while the market was trading from

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
the low

325
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,839
at

326
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,399
105.34

327
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,360
all the way up to 115 big figure

328
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,839
there wasn't any significant move on

329
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,839
sell stops at all

330
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,560
they were driving price up to take the

331
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,360
liquidity out at 115.

332
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
once that liquidity was taken out in the

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
form of the buy stop raid at 115 big

334
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,040
figure

335
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
the market broke down and created a

336
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
violation of a short-term low that

337
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
short-term low had trailing cell stops

338
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
resting below it

339
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,600
those cell stops would now would be

340
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
violated

341
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
and canceled so any longs would be

342
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
knocked out at this point

343
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,440
now you need to be paying close

344
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
attention because this is where the

345
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,000
rubber meets the road

346
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,399
this

347
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
short-term low

348
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
and that run on the cell stops

349
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
right below that low here you want to

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,959
draw special attention to that right now

351
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
because this is your first clue

352
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,440
that we are probably going to work

353
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,079
the sell side of the liquidity

354
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,680
we don't know it at the time when it

355
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
first forms we have to start watching

356
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,519
what price does we already know we have

357
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,519
a strong rejection above the 115 big

358
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,720
figure and we've came a long way from

359
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,199
105 34

360
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
with none of the cell stocks taken

361
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,839
except for this one here

362
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,199
now we have a short term height that's

363
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,160
violated just briefly

364
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
but my question is is that short-term

365
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,839
little violation above an old high

366
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
is that making new ground for new highs

367
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,199
no it didn't even challenge the old high

368
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
but look at the strong rejection right

369
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
above that high

370
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
it creates another

371
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
lower low

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
so this short term low

373
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,800
right here

374
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,839
also

375
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
sees its liquidity in the form of the

376
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
cell stops

377
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
ran out as well

378
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
my question to you is this at this

379
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,279
moment

380
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,399
right now

381
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
it's at the midway point or equilibrium

382
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
between the 105 34 and the 115 big

383
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,839
figure

384
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
the chances of this creating a higher

385
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,399
high

386
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,079
where we're at right now relative to the

387
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
115 big figure

388
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
is not likely not because it's hindsight

389
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
and it's right in front of me but

390
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
because it's showing indications that it

391
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
can't create new ground once the buy

392
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,800
stop side of the liquidity is taken

393
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
but it's creating new lower ground every

394
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
single time a short-term low is violated

395
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
it gathers up more momentum and gathers

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,399
more

397
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,880
distance between the range of 115 big

398
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
figure and 105 34. so every time it

399
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
drops it drops a little bit more but

400
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
every time it rallies it fails to make a

401
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
new high even if it takes a short-term

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,199
high out

403
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,440
it's not gaining any more ground on the

404
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
upside

405
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,320
every rally is being distributed

406
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
we have a short-term high here as well

407
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,839
and those buy stops are ran out as well

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,880
same question does this rally above a

409
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,839
short-term high create a new high

410
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,720
no

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,279
it can't even get above the previous

412
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,880
failed attempt to make another higher

413
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,759
high

414
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
at the 114 big figure

415
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,519
then once again we have a rally through

416
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,000
an old high

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,160
does it gain new ground no but it's

418
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
quickly rejected and trades lower and

419
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
then

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,559
violates

421
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,839
two times

422
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
it goes below

423
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
the 109 10 level

424
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
once briefly before running up and

425
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
taking that run on 112

426
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,079
95

427
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,760
and then rejecting that level after

428
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
taking the buy stops out

429
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,079
and making a run for another pass

430
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,520
through the 108 50s

431
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
this

432
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,080
short

433
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
from this high at 1 12 95

434
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
was on the heels of the u s elections we

435
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,640
saw a strong dollar and the market

436
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,120
quickly rejected all of the rallies in

437
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,919
foreign currencies

438
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,880
the movement below

439
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
every short-term low

440
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,559
and gaining more ground

441
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
on the downside

442
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
that's the indication you look for

443
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
regardless of whatever time frame you're

444
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
trading but on the daily chart

445
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
you're looking for clues that it wants

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to gain more momentum

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
on one side of the market or the other

448
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,039
you're going to reference where the buy

449
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,200
stops are available highs and where the

450
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
sell stops are below old lows but what

451
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,240
you're watching for is the tug of war

452
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
that takes place between each new run on

453
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,400
stops below the market

454
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
and above the market

455
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
if you notice where the intermediate

456
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
term highs are

457
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,919
if intermediate term highs keep creating

458
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
lower intermediate term highs

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and enemy term lows and short-term lows

460
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
keep going lower each time

461
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,280
it's telling you that it wants the open

462
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
float below the marketplace in other

463
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
words it wants to seek to sell side

464
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
liquidity

465
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,720
it's going to draw lower so now think

466
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
about what this has done for you

467
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
it gives you a directional bias on the

468
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
daily chart

469
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
and it takes a long time for these moves

470
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
to take place

471
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,520
but

472
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
once you're studying price and you look

473
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,679
for these clues across many pairs and

474
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
many asset classes

475
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
you'll see that this is in fact what

476
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
leads you

477
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,160
to

478
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
daily chart

479
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
directional bias which also will

480
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
serve you very well in other disciplines

481
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
of trading whether it be day trading

482
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
scalping short-term trading or swing

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
this will give you

484
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
what you're looking for in terms of how

485
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,679
do i know what side of the market it's

486
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,280
going to make the run on is it going to

487
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
run the buy stops or it's going to run

488
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
the cell stops

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,039
think about what time frame you're

490
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,760
looking at here this is a daily chart

491
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
if the daily chart is indicating that it

492
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,039
wants to run

493
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,280
lower because it has no problem getting

494
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
down below short term lows

495
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
but every rally

496
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
has a failure to make new ground and

497
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
can't make a higher high

498
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
when it does make a higher high it's

499
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
punished immediately

500
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
but the high that it makes is always

501
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
just above a short-term

502
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
insignificant high

503
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,080
every time it does this it solidifies a

504
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,760
intermediate term high

505
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,000
that is now lower than the previous

506
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
intermediate term high

507
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,600
an intermediate term high is any high

508
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,240
that has a short term high to the left

509
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,480
of it and to the right of it

510
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
think of it like a head and shoulders

511
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,480
top formation

512
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
every time you see

513
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,880
a

514
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
enemy term high that has a lower enemy

515
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
term high to the left of it and enemy

516
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,039
term high to the right of it that's

517
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
actually a long term high in the middle

518
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
again think like a head and shoulders

519
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
pattern now invert that

520
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
and you'll have the same thing that

521
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,760
would be said for an immediate term low

522
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
or a long term low

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
once you see that in price you'll

524
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
actually see the

525
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
market structure that i actually learned

526
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
from studying larry williams as a new

527
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,159
trader

528
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,159
you can see the market structure in this

529
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,679
entire

530
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,440
sample size of data

531
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,799
it's multiple

532
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,480
intermediate term highs

533
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,159
and long term highs that are

534
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
significantly

535
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,400
signaling that the market in fact wanted

536
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,799
to go lower

537
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,360
there was a liquidity void

538
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,520
around the

539
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,360
106.80 level

540
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,440
to

541
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,240
106.35

542
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,600
it filled that in when all the way down

543
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,880
to the short-term low at 105.34

544
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,320
bounce a little bit there and then

545
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,960
ultimately

546
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
once breaking that low

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
at 107 big figure

548
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
it reached down below

549
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,679
to take this outside liquidity out

550
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
now when you study the daily charts like

551
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
this you can look at

552
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
a lot of examples

553
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
but they require time

554
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
and unfortunately

555
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
they don't give you a lot of turnaround

556
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,679
time for study but in hindsight you can

557
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,400
go back and look at a plethora of

558
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
really nice trading examples where you

559
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
can see where liquidity was ran on one

560
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
side the market was drawn up for three

561
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
to six months

562
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
okay look at the move from

563
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:15,840
the

564
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,480
december low of 2015

565
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,200
up to the high made in may of 2016.

566
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,840
it's about six

567
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,400
months

568
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
then the move from that high

569
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
in the spring of 2016

570
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,559
it traded all the way down to a low

571
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,120
made in

572
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,559
