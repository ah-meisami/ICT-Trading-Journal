foreign

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,920
welcome back this is lesson 1.4 defining

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,540
open float liquidity pools

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,640
okay we're gonna be looking at the

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,960
Canadian dollar for this teaching

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,460
okay we should look at here's a chart of

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,140
the Canadian dollar Futures chart

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,400
this is the March delivery contract for

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,800
Canadian dollar

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,340
foreign

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,760
CAD pair daily chart

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
when we're looking at price

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,320
what we like to do is identify on a

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,540
higher time frame where are the

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,940
liquidity pools for the large funds

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,860
because the liquidity pools for the

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,500
large funds is largely where markets

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,420
will want to reach for apart from

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,660
long-term fundamentals on a intermediate

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,579
term basis that means about three or

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,719
four months the large funds open float

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,360
the liquidity that's above old highs or

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,880
below old lows that will be generally

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,939
targeted every quarter

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,740
how do we go about identifying which

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,540
ones that we should be focusing on right

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,299
now we have to incorporate a technique

28
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,560
called open float

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,020
now open float is simply just taking the

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,939
last three months

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,600
or taking the last month and a half to

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,439
the next month and a half in the future

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
encapsulating that time

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
and basically you're looking at

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,299
three months of data

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,159
and by doing that what I'll do is give

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,200
you a range to look for the highest high

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
and the lowest low on the daily chart

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,659
which will lead you to where the large

40
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,759
funds liquidity pools are above and

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,399
below the market price

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
for example let's assume for a moment

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,460
it's August 1st

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,420
and we can look back and see where the

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,340
highest high was in the last 60 days

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,160
over the last 40 days and over the last

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
20 days prior to August 1st

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,420
we can identify also the

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,080
lowest low and the highest high

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,900
in the first 20 trading days to the

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,879
right of August 1st

52
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,099
then 40 days out what's the high and low

53
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,780
of that range

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,819
and what's the high and low the range 60

55
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,700
days out from August 1st

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,640
when you have that range 60 days look

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,140
back in 60 days cast forward that is

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,720
open float you want to find the highest

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,180
high and the lowest low in between those

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,500
two reference points and time

61
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,319
on a near-term basis you can look back

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,580
and see what the last 60 days trading

63
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,640
days range was high and low in this case

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,879
we can see the lowest here

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,220
and the high is here

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,140
going forward because we're looking at

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,140
the look back period here casting

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,780
forward those levels we can see that

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,980
eventually during the month of September

70
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,739
those highs that were formed in the

71
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,099
latter portion of July 2016 they were in

72
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,620
fact rated

73
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,560
so the market was drawn to the buy stops

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,040
on the fund level at those July highs

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,099
extending it out so that we have 60 days

76
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,159
look back and then 60 days cast forward

77
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,500
we can see what the total open float is

78
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,000
with the low end seen here

79
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,900
in the high end seen here

80
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,739
you can see the market did in fact

81
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,319
eventually still dry forward reaching

82
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,440
for the buy stops above

83
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,900
the October highs in 2016.

84
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,360
so if we're looking at the market like

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
this we can also identify where

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,500
significant short term and intermediate

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,298
term highs and lows are

88
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,760
if we look at the last range of 20 days

89
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,280
behind us and 20 days casting forward

90
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,620
expecting a new high or a new low to

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,699
form

92
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,860
because no one can accurately depict the

93
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,440
future and forecast the future we have

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,479
ideal times to look for in terms of

95
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,940
intervals 20 40 and 60 days intervals

96
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,060
looking back for the most obvious buy

97
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,639
stops and sell stops

98
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,800
don't just look for the highest high in

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
the last 60 days and the lowest low in

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,180
the last 60 days behind us or in the

101
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,340
look back phase what we're doing is

102
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,919
we're looking for where's the near-term

103
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,500
high and low in the last 20 days

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
whereas the short-term high and low in

105
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,160
the last 40 days

106
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,900
and where's the intermediate term high

107
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,780
and low in the last 60 days

108
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,180
that same thing can be done casting

109
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,560
forward

110
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,639
for looking at August 1st 2016

111
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,880
we can cast forward 20 trading days and

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
expect a range of high and low to form

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,000
noting what that high and low is on that

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,280
particular range will give us the

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
liquidity pulls that are on a near-term

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,259
basis the easiest ones from the market

117
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,979
to reach for

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,979
when we're looking at short-term trades

119
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,320
and day trades that range is going to be

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,560
easy and helpful for you for intraday

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
scalps and day trading

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,580
when we look out 40 days

123
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
it gives us a little bit more of a

124
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,460
short-term basis for defining the

125
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,440
liquidity pools on the daily chart

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,320
looking for the last High and the last

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,199
low in the last 40 days that made the

128
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
highest high and lowest low buy stocks

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,860
would be above that high

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,199
and sales tax would be below that low

131
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,840
in LTC 60 days cast forward from the

132
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,539
first of August would give us the

133
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,639
boundary point at which open float ends

134
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,240
in terms of time not in terms of price

135
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,100
but in terms of time so we are

136
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,560
bracketing the market if you will 60

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,139
days forward in time

138
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,139
and we're looking at back in the past 60

139
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,319
days so we have 120 trading days

140
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,979
of what would be called open float

141
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,419
we're looking for the highest high and

142
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
the lowest low in that range but every

143
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,080
20 days

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,419
there's a high and a low form now you're

145
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,280
about to experience a growth spurt one

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,840
of the most powerful patterns I like to

147
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,539
trade is the turtle soup which is a

148
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,000
false break above old high and a false

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
break below an old well

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,020
the pattern that I learned about that

151
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,139
was taught in Street smarts book while

152
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not teaching that pattern here out

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
of respect for the the authors of that

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,100
book the idea of a false break above or

155
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,199
below

156
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,340
based on

157
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,100
the turtles trading pattern which is a

158
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,440
long-term trading pattern or system if

159
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
you will

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
that allow long-term trends to pay out

161
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,919
the turtle Traders and turtle Traders if

162
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,599
you know what they are Richard Dennis

163
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,000
put together a hodgepodge of different

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,639
walks of life people all from different

165
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,979
walks of life for the purpose of

166
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,419
teaching them

167
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,819
the concept of trading and he used a

168
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,319
long-term trading model

169
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,199
and he taught that buying a breakout

170
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
above a 20-day High holding for

171
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,880
long-term trends or selling short a

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,539
20-day low holding for long-term trends

173
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,860
while they had a lot of losing trades

174
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,840
their winners were monstrous it's a

175
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,539
trend following system which is what I

176
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,060
teach that the large funds are in the

177
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
Foreign Exchange Market they're

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,660
long-term Trend following because these

179
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,120
markets are highly linked to

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,220
interest rate markets which are under

181
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,380
underlying fundamental drivers for the

182
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,520
marketplace

183
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,259
long-term trends are in fact

184
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,020
fundamentally driven in currencies but

185
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,099
because

186
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,400
the system was based on buying on a

187
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,460
breakout of the 20 period or selling

188
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
below 20 period low

189
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,919
that breakout many times was false and

190
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,860
in itself it gives us an edge so if we

191
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,720
look at every interval of 20 trading

192
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,500
days

193
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,039
which is what we have here 20 40 60. you

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,440
can encapsulate where the next high and

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,140
the next low is on price

196
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,419
and where the highest and lowest low on

197
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,760
each 20-day interval going forward and

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,160
looking back you'll know where device

199
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,200
thoughts and sell stops are so that we

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,420
can take respective trades based on that

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,940
also if you notice that the buy stops

202
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,000
keep getting hit and rarely do the sell

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,459
stops keep getting hit by default it

204
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,080
teaches you to institutional order flow

205
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,980
is what

206
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,380
bullish it's looking for higher prices

207
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,500
it keeps drawing on the buy stops above

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,600
the marketplace

209
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
and conversely if we notice that the

210
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
cell stops keep getting ran out and very

211
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
rarely do the buy stops keep getting hit

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
that tells us what for institution order

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
flow it tells us that the institutional

214
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,440
overflow is bearish so therefore the

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,820
banks are making a move on the large

216
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,160
funds liquidity below the lows or

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
running their sell stops

218
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
okay moving forward one month this is

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
September 2016.

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
the same thing is done here we've

221
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,220
identified where the ranges in terms of

222
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,080
the look back 60 trading days from the

223
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
beginning of September and we have 60

224
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,459
trading Days cast forward we're going to

225
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,100
look for the lowest low in the last 60

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,360
trading days

227
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
prior to September 1st

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,940
and that's this one here

229
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,560
and the highest high

230
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,380
in the last 60 days is here

231
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,620
and again we can keep noticing that the

232
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,959
buy stops above old highs keep getting

233
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,880
taken out you can see that high is

234
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,160
violated also in the month of September

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
moving forward we have

236
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,880
October 2016.

237
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,860
look back period of 60 days and cast

238
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,260
forward of 60 days we have identified

239
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,580
our range or open float

240
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,260
the highest high in the last 60 trading

241
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,200
days prior to October 1st 2016 is this

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,260
High here and the lowest low in our look

243
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,360
back period of 60 days is here so open

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,700
float on a large fund level are

245
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,500
referenced by these two price points the

246
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,660
higher it's where the buy stops are and

247
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,640
the lowers where the sell stops are

248
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,060
so they're looking for the buy stops

249
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
above the marketplace and they keep

250
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,079
taking those buy stops out notice also

251
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,880
in the first 20 trading days to the

252
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,440
right or the future from October

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,260
2012 there's a low that forms in the

254
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,880
Canadian dollar

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,420
it takes the lows out in the form of the

256
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,100
bodies of the candles made in the last

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,560
portion of September then there's a

258
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,940
rejection that trades higher so we had

259
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,920
one attempt here to clear out the sell

260
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,700
side liquidity

261
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,180
moving forward delineating our

262
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,500
open float range for November 2016. you

263
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,720
can see the look back period

264
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,779
60 trading days maximum 40 trading days

265
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,880
and 20 trading days the highest high and

266
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,459
the lowest low formed in the last 20 and

267
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,540
40 and 60 trading days

268
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,180
the lowest lowest seen here

269
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,220
highest high seen here and again going

270
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,500
forward into November we can see that

271
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
that high was in fact taken out on the

272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,760
upside so they keep taking the buy stops

273
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,560
out and institutional order flow is

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,700
indicated as bullish

275
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,700
casting forward one more time into

276
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,620
December 2016.

277
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,100
looking back last 60 trading days prior

278
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,860
to December 1st the lowest low is seen

279
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,899
here sales tax will be resting below

280
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,060
that in a large fund level

281
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,220
and buy stocks will be resting just

282
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,480
above

283
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,820
the high scene here notice also in the

284
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,640
first 20 trading days after December 1st

285
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
2016 We Made It Low

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,980
and then price ran eventually up into

287
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,959
creating another higher high but blowing

288
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,600
out the buy stops above the November

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,980
High

290
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,260
and then ultimately making a run down

291
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,540
into

292
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,100
a lower low

293
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,899
for January

294
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,720
and it forms in the first 40 trading

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,600
days after December 1st 2016.

296
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,899
and going forward in time

297
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,779
at the time of this recording

298
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,600
look back period last 60 trading days

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,540
you see as low as low as seen here

300
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,300
highest highs seen here we have already

301
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,180
violated the lowest low so we've taken

302
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,820
out the cell stops on a large funds

303
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,160
level and

304
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,459
we can look forward in time for a new

305
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,800
price like that retrace higher and then

306
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,180
see if they want to take it lower

307
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,399
because it's all indicating that they

308
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,500
want to take out the sell side liquidity

309
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,540
now

310
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,820
okay let's take a look at the dollar CAD

311
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,399
pair this is the daily chart and let's

312
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,040
apply some of these ideas on the daily

313
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,339
chart

314
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,720
okay you can see the bodies of the

315
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,220
candles over here

316
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,279
we did Wick down below

317
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,680
130 50 level and retrace a little bit

318
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
that's where the cell stops will be

319
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,700
resting oh no

320
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,320
intermediate term basis because we're

321
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
looking at a daily time frame

322
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,880
price advancing does trade down there

323
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,800
and takes those sell stops out of the

324
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,440
marketplace and quickly runs away

325
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
next area up here the bodies of the

326
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,920
candles you can see that Wicks through

327
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
it

328
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
five stops will be resting just above

329
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,459
that

330
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,320
large funds

331
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,600
have their buy stops taken out here and

332
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,620
then quickly rejected

333
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,180
and we have a low down here with the

334
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,339
bodies of the candles

335
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,079
sales thoughts will be rested just below

336
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,839
that and we can see the market does in

337
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,820
fact sweep down there and take the sell

338
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,279
side liquidity out

339
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,399
so what makes these false breaks and and

340
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,040
false breaks higher and lower so

341
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,839
lucrative is the fact that we understand

342
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
that large traders in the form of a fund

343
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,579
Trader they have their buy stops above

344
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,440
these levels and they have their sell

345
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
stops below these levels

346
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
every 20 trading days there's going to

347
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,880
be a new liquidity pool formed

348
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,040
it's going to be on the buy side and on

349
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,139
the sell side you just have to identify

350
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,260
where those ranges are in respective

351
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,360
terms to where the most obvious swing

352
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,459
high and swing low is formed and then

353
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,199
frame that going forward whereas the

354
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
next 20 days high and low whereas the

355
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,519
next 20 days high and low keep going out

356
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,040
but looking back in the last 60 days and

357
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,920
looking forward into the future 60 days

358
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,680
gives us the range for open float the

359
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
highest high and the lowest low in that

360
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,260
range of 120 days that's what the large

361
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,279
fund macro is in other words we're there

362
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,320
aiming for the large fund buy stops or

363
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,660
sell stops they're going to be derived

364
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,399
at looking at where the range high and

365
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,940
low is on the last 120 days 60 days

366
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,139
backwards

367
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,360
in time and with the next high and low

368
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,399
if it makes a higher high in the next

369
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
new 60 trading days

370
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
we don't know where that high is going

371
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,459
to be in in the future we don't know if

372
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,079
it's going to create a higher high or if

373
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,699
it's going to make a lower low

374
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,160
we just monitor as price creates new

375
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,500
price swings on highs and lows

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,959
where are we in relative terms to the

377
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,540
last 60 trading days are we making a

378
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,620
higher high

379
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,440
then the the highest high or are we

380
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,420
making a lower low in the lowest low in

381
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,920
the last 60 days

382
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,519
and we look forward 60 trading days into

383
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,339
the future and we keep moving that basis

384
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,100
forward each new month we're looking for

385
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,620
and we're we'll eventually arrive at the

386
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,300
institution order Flow by default you

387
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,440
can see where they're running the market

388
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
they're taking out buy stops

389
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,279
continuously rarely if ever taking out

390
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,500
cell stops what's telling you do they

391
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
want to press the market higher they

392
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,399
keep grinding against those large funds

393
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,660
so

394
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,959
if it's seen as an opposite where we

395
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,760
keep seeing the sell stops keep getting

396
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
ran out and very real the buy stocks get

397
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,740
taken out institutional order flow is

398
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,259
bearish so therefore as long as we

399
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,720
continuously see the market making new

400
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,100
lows

401
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,259
we keep watching that range of the last

402
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,120
60 days and where are we in relationship

403
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,399
to that are we above it or below it if

404
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,380
we're above it we have to continuously

405
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,779
keep seeing buy stops get taken out if

406
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,399
you start seeing cell stops get taken

407
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,139
out we're probably making a quarterly

408
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,079
shift and the reverse is said if we're

409
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,339
below the last 60 days low

410
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,040
and if we're below that last 60 days low

411
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,020
we're really oversold we're in a deep

412
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,540
discount market and if we start seeing

413
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,400
buy stops getting hit and very rarely

414
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,380
new we now see cell stops getting hit

415
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,660
we're probably performing a market

416
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,720
structure shift or quarterly shift for

417
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,059
a new Direction in the marketplace

418
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,580
and you can see that in fact is what

419
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,360
happens here with the Canadian dollar

420
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
so let's take this information and go

421
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,620
back to the Futures Market

422
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,820
and take a look at some things

423
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,320
now obviously this is going to be the

424
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,299
price action of the Futures Contract

425
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,520
which is going to be inverted from what

426
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
we see when we're studying the dollar

427
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
Index versus the Canadian dollar because

428
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,620
that pair starts with the US dollar

429
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,440
first that means when that market is

430
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,200
going higher as a pair that means the

431
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,820
dollar strong in Canadian dollars weak

432
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,299
if the dollar cad's going

433
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,280
lower that means the dollar Index is

434
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,840
weak and the Canadian dollar is

435
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
strengthening

436
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,320
well in this case

437
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,080
we are looking at the Futures Contract

438
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,240
of Canadian dollar and I want you to

439
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,799
look at the same reference points we

440
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
just showed in the previous slide

441
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
we're just going to do the opposite in

442
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,440
the Futures Market

443
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,840
you see the bodies of the candles being

444
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,020
ran out here in December

445
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,260
and then quickly rejected

446
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,960
we can see the bodies of the candle

447
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,280
made in November gets rated in December

448
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,299
and quickly Rejects and it runs for what

449
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,280
the bodies of the candles here we're

450
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,480
running the old high out where buy

451
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,220
stocks will be resting

452
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,380
and that's where we're at presently but

453
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,900
prior to that big run up

454
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,200
off of that 73

455
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,360
50 73 65 level

456
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,100
take a look at this right here

457
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,020
I gave you a teaching with the

458
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,780
Australian dollar and I showed you how

459
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,120
we can use these quarterly shifts to

460
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,220
take place

461
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,140
and open interest

462
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,179
off of support resistance ideas on a

463
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,580
higher time frame basis

464
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,140
when we're looking at higher time frame

465
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,740
charts we are identifying Clues and

466
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,880
seeking

467
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
evidences that we can see that they are

468
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,140
about to make a move on one side of the

469
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,000
marketplace we understand what's making

470
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,860
that short-term fluctuation could be

471
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,600
largely attributed to just running the

472
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
stops on funds

473
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,860
large fund traders buy stops and sell

474
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,980
stops but it's not always that the

475
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,500
markets are moving based on very very

476
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,600
long-term fundamentals and as it relates

477
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,820
to higher time frame charts but every

478
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,559
three months there can be a manipulative

479
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,320
phase in the marketplace that still can

480
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,059
be a catalyst for us to be a Trader

481
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,520
taking high probability entries

482
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,500
and looking for high probability exit

483
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,720
points and by looking at where the

484
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,539
logical fund level traders buy stocks

485
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,240
and sell stocks would be and looking for

486
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
evidence is that the market is showing

487
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,039
participation by smart money

488
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,919
I.E the banks if the Market's trading

489
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,220
down to a support level at 73.80 to 7360

490
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,080
in that range

491
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
we have a clue here that once the market

492
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
start trading lower from the 7 500 to

493
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,860
74.60 74 40 level to 7400 and then once

494
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,280
we got below 73.80 level by that point

495
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,980
open interest had already tanked you can

496
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,919
see clearly here that's a huge drop it's

497
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
a massive drop

498
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,240
you only need a 15 the decrease to have

499
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,200
a massive uh indication that there's big

500
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,220
huge

501
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
institutional sponsorship behind the

502
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,340
move that you're expecting if open

503
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,020
interest is declining what they're

504
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,539
saying to us is they are not willing to

505
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,440
be

506
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,919
offering sell side liquidity to buyers

507
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,020
they don't want that so they're scaring

508
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,760
those individuals by dropping the market

509
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,559
really quickly and open interest

510
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,679
declines rapidly open interest only

511
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,539
declines as an Evidence

512
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,799
that the smart money are not wanting to

513
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,039
be heavily short high open interest is a

514
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,559
indication that there's a big massive

515
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,200
liquidity uh program that's been offered

516
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,740
for buyers the bank is offering that as

517
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,559
risk they're holding the risk on that

518
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,260
but if open interest declines while the

519
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,880
market drops off precipitously and it

520
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,380
goes into a support level because look

521
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,679
at what's happening in November 2016.

522
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
the Canadian dollars Futures Contract it

523
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,500
rallied from around 73.80 up to 76.40

524
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,840
which is a very respectable range

525
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,120
price comes back down runs the bodies of

526
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,980
the candles that was formed as a low in

527
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,900
November 2016.

528
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,539
price comes down again looking for

529
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,820
another shift in the marketplace

530
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,400
it runs out the sell stops below the

531
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,179
7380 level with an old low remember we

532
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,679
look back in

533
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,500
higher time frame institution order flow

534
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,299
reference points

535
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,780
liquidity pools water blocks fair value

536
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,059
gaps equilibrium

537
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,280
all those price points we used and

538
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
learned in September we look for those

539
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,900
in our higher time frame charts

540
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,700
we're seeing a liquidity pool in the

541
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,200
form of a cell stop

542
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,380
resting around 73.80 they make that run

543
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,140
and on low open interest at a support

544
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,640
level they are indicating that it's

545
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,860
going to go up higher if the Futures

546
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,080
Contract for the Canadian dollar marks

547
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,419
contract delivery is indicating that

548
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,640
there is very low open interest at a

549
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
support level at a time when the stops

550
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
have been running out below the

551
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,100
marketplace

552
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,080
that's indicating what potential

553
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,140
strength and you can see the price

554
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,419
action that transpired after that rather

555
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,280
explosive price move

556
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,299
looking for a move from 73.80 all the

557
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,700
way up to 76.80

558
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,640
so 300 Pips move up

559
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,679
from one specific level that could be

560
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,480
easily derived by looking at the

561
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,100
evidences that we've shown here in this

562
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,020
teaching

563
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,780
using open float

564
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,840
casting forward 60 days casting forward

565
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,900
40 days casting forward 20 days notice

566
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,720
also every 20 trading days

567
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,179
the high and the low becomes very

568
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,159
obvious you can start circling these as

569
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,559
you create new highs every time there's

570
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,880
a new higher high

571
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,179
note that and then wait for the price to

572
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,600
come back down to an old 20-day low

573
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
study that every 20-day High every

574
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,760
20-day low is going to have buy stocks

575
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,679
and sell sauce resting above the highs

576
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,440
and below the lows if you do this as an

577
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,659
exercise going forward you'll see

578
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,159
clearly what side of the marketplace

579
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,740
it's seeking if it keeps taking out the

580
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,799
buy stops or the highs the market is

581
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,900
doing what it's moving higher it means

582
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,280
institutional overflow is on the buy

583
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,900
side you don't want to be selling short

584
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,640
in those conditions

585
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,620
if the market is taking out the sell

586
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,419
side liquidity continuously and rarely

587
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,240
ever taking out the highs of the uh

588
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,100
price action that means that

589
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,360
institutional overflow is indicated

590
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
lower and you want to focus primarily on

591
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,500
being short

592
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,600
until we get an obvious change in

593
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,580
Direction how would that happen well if

594
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,200
you go and you start trading to the

595
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,900
lowest low in the last 60 days

596
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,400
well we're probably going to be very

597
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,100
very deeply uh oversold and we're going

598
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,780
to be in deep discount even if the price

599
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,419
only bounces a little bit on a higher

600
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,159
time frame like this it can bounce

601
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,659
you know a great deal it could be over

602
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,880
150 200 Pips sometimes and then

603
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,520
eventually roll over and continuous uh

604
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,620
fashion keep going lower you don't want

605
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,360
to be caught on the wrong side of the

606
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,980
marketplace trading on a hard time frame

607
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,860
chart and not see the evidences that

608
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,440
it's given you and trade accordingly you

609
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,940
have to have all these things in mind

610
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,059
looking for where the liquidity is and

611
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,980
the easiest way to do it

612
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,659
and to make all this very simple because

613
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,700
it could be very easily complicated and

614
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,980
I'm sure probably complicated in many of

615
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,059
your minds

616
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,120
what you're looking for is a revolving

617
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,159
continuous range of 120 days

618
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,860
and you whatever day you're looking at

619
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,320
you look back 60 and you look forward

620
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
60. so there's 120 days there and you're

621
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
constantly monitoring where's the

622
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,860
highest high and the lowest low in those

623
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,840
in that range

624
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,000
and that's where the buy stops and the

625
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,500
sell stocks are going to be on a large

626
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,760
fund level

627
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,559
the

628
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,159
look back phase is where the hard stops

629
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,179
are going to be

630
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,400
that means where the actual buys and

631
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,620
sell stops are going to be aboggan oil

632
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,360
high and Below an old low

633
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,240
but if we are looking forward studying

634
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,059
new price action as it occurs

635
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,620
you need to be mindful of where you are

636
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,039
in the last 60 days range are we near a

637
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
high or are we near a low

638
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,820
and that's also going to be indicative

639
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,820
of where we see the next quarterly shift

640
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,159
if it's going to be continuously moving

641
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,480
higher and higher and higher it keeps

642
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,240
taking out buy stops eventually

643
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,340
unless you're in a one-sided parabolic

644
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,380
price move which we'll teach about

645
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,940
uh generally you don't see too many of

646
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,100
those uh the market generally moves from

647
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,400
range to range and using this concept it

648
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,659
will be very beneficial to you because

649
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,179
you can see where the near turn that

650
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,240
means to 20 period high and low in terms

651
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,279
of trading days and I'll say that again

652
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,100
the next near-term move is going to run

653
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,100
on the near-term buy stops or sell stops

654
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,679
that means the last 20 days range what's

655
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,880
the highest high and the lowest low

656
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,659
that's the near term open float

657
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,820
the short-term open float is what's the

658
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,080
highest high and the lowest loan will

659
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,760
last 40 trading days

660
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,100
and the intermediate term open float is

661
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,480
going to be the highest high and lowest

662
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,000
low in the last 60 days

663
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,919
knowing where you are in that range and

664
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,179
what side of the marketplace keeps

665
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,220
getting taken out will give you Clues as

666
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,980
to what the next shift in price is going

667
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,960
to be once it starts to break down you

668
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,100
know you're going to have a significant

669
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,419
price move and you can trade that

670
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,580
accordingly even on a daily time frame

671
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,659
where you don't have to go down to a

672
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,279
lower time frame for entry you can

673
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,159
execute purely off of the daily chart

674
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,419
so we're going to build on these ideas

675
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,520
as we go through the rest of January

676
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
until next time this concludes this

677
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,299
teaching wish good luck in good Trading
