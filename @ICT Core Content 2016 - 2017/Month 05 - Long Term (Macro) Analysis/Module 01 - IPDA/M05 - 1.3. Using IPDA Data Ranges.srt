1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,520
all right guys

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
we're going to be looking at a ipta data

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,960
range example

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
and we'll be focusing on the australian

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,719
dollar now if you've noticed we've had a

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
little bit of a run up on aussie

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,199
and we're gonna break this down a little

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
bit in context why i was expecting the

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
the levels that we're looking at now

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
to be hit

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,599
looking at the charts that we share on

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
the forum so if you're not paying

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,480
attention to those charts or if you're

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
not saving them

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,160
it might be a good idea while we're

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
doing

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,960
this month not that i'm encouraging you

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,040
to do this throughout the mentorship

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
but when we do

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
daily reviews

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
i'm taking you basically to the points

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,480
at which i'm drawing my attention to on

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
my own journal how i have reference

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,719
points on my own charts

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,920
what you see

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,840
me noting on those daily entries on the

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
forum there are the points at which i'm

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
keeping focus

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
in my own journal and any salient points

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,119
that would be

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
in addition to those levels i will make

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
in terms of commentary

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
but the

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
the month of january when we do these

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
daily entries where i do the dollar

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
index euro dollar british pound us

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,600
dollar

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
dollar cad and aussie dollar

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
when i share them with you

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
don't just click on them and wait for

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
some kind of a neon sign and say buy

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,000
here sell here i want you to be focusing

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
on what i'm drawing your attention to

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
and then watching how price

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
moves to these levels

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
regardless of what type of trader you're

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,240
going to be you're going to need to be

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
focusing on how that happens from

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,159
beginning or from foresight to when now

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,680
we can talk about it in hindsight

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
because all these things

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
are going to help

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,600
you prepare yourself for when you

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,759
anticipate something and then waiting

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
throughout that process because it's not

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
is quickly learned by simply looking at

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,799
a hindsight example where i can say okay

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
this is what we said the market was

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
going to do this is where we thought the

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,119
market was going to happen and here it

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,160
is bang

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
when you see it

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
in the charts and draw your attention is

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
drawn to it beforehand

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
there's a submission to time that's

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
required and unfortunately we gloss over

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
that many times even as educators like

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
myself

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,440
it's hard to communicate what's required

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
in terms of having to wait for that

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,239
thing to unfold or develop in the chart

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
just simply because we have a level or

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,239
an order block or a target even for

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,480
price to get to

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
when you show a hindsight example it

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
that part of the lesson which in my

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
opinion is the

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
that's the main that's the main point

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
you have to learn you have to learn to

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
wait for these things to unfold the

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
impatience that

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
the market presents us an opportunity to

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
experience is overwhelming sometimes and

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
while i'm many times accredited for

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
being very patient i am not really a

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
patient person at all i'm very impatient

87
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,959
uh that's the reason why i don't do long

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
term position trading but

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,360
i'm going to counsel you to go in every

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
single day when we do our daily entries

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,080
for

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
the content whether it be a video

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
review or whether it be a a teaching or

94
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
if it's something along the lines of

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
just simply

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
providing the charts

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,599
you want to be

98
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,480
really

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,640
copying those charts printing them out

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
make you hold me hold me to

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
the standard of if i know what i'm doing

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
then it should be evidenced in this okay

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
for you for the most part we've seen

104
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
many times that occurring but for your

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
learning you need to say okay this is

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
when this was noted this is when the

107
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
observation was made so how long did it

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
take

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
for this to occur

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,720
now since january is focused primarily

111
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,239
on the daily chart

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840
obviously each daily candle when it

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
paints and closes for the day it

114
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
obviously takes 24 hours to do that so

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,599
yes

116
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
we can glibly say

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
it takes 24 hours for this candle to

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,439
form and this is what it takes in terms

119
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,319
of uh the setup or level being reached

120
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
over this period of time it could took

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
three days or four days or two weeks

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
you need to experience that you need to

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
be being mindful of how long those

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,238
things take

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,600
especially on these higher time frame

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
charts if you don't do this

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
and you're new or you're just a

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,520
relatively

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
inexperienced trader

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,639
some of you that are in my group that

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
have been trading for a long time

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
know exactly what i'm referring to

133
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,919
there's a big

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,639
gap in between learning something with

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
examples in hindsight and textbook and

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
even being taught something in a webinar

137
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
or a workshop live where people say this

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
is what happened in the marketplace it's

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
missing that element of having to endure

140
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,800
what needs to be weighted upon to come

141
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
into your chart you can't just simply

142
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
say okay well this is the outcome i'm

143
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,080
expecting and therefore you know it

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
needs to happen on my time that's the

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,479
part that kills traders it was very

146
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
influential in my early

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
days as a trader because i i needed it

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,400
to happen right away because i first

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
started trading things were moving quick

150
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,039
there were fast markets and then when i

151
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
realized that it wasn't like that always

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
it was a very big struggling point for

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
me

154
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,280
so

155
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,520
just go in every day gather those charts

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
up print them out keep a running log of

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
them in fact it's probably a good idea

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
just to print them out every day and

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,639
just get yourself a three ring binder

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
punch some holes in it date them okay

161
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
and then keep track it's a good

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
reference point to go back on saturdays

163
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
and sundays on the weekend when we're

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479
not really doing anything

165
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,639
go back and look at what was observed

166
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
before the fact and then how long it

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
took for these things to develop and

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
those levels to be reached and what was

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
the response after it got to those

170
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,840
levels

171
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
okay so it's important you go through

172
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
the mentorship with that in mind i'm not

173
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
just showing you

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,520
trophies or you know just

175
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
things in passing i'm really trying to

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,440
draw your attention to something that i

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
want you to focus on and study how long

178
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
it takes for these things to come to

179
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,400
fruition

180
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
okay so get it let's get into the

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
australian dollar example where the if

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
the data range all right so we have here

183
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
a futures chart

184
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
okay this is the march contract the

185
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
underlying daily chart of the futures

186
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,319
contract of the australian dollar

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
and by looking at

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
the futures contract if we're going to

189
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
be trading forex okay it's it's really

190
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
important that you know that you can get

191
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,919
a lot of insight just by studying

192
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
the underlying futures

193
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
price so since if we're looking at the

194
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
australian usd pair as our case study

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
we're going to be looking at how

196
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
influential the study of just the

197
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,479
futures contract alone

198
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,160
how that's paramount and understanding

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
how that moves right into and segways

200
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,319
beautifully into trading in the foreign

201
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
exchange market if i were to do a poll

202
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
right now if we were all in the same

203
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
room together okay and we simply said

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,280
hey look um

205
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
i've never traded forex or i've never

206
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
changed futures

207
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
if you were

208
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
studying one or the other i guarantee

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
you a large percent of you probably 80

210
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,280
or more

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,560
never really refer to the opposite in

212
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
terms of the analysis so what i mean by

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,240
that is if you're a futurist trader

214
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
you've never considered what the foreign

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,039
exchange markets doing or if you're a

216
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
futurist trader i'm sorry a forex trader

217
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,319
you've never considered what the

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
underlying futures contract is doing

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,520
vice versa

220
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
it's imperative that you understand what

221
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
they're both doing

222
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
to get a complete picture you want to be

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,639
looking at both

224
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
now obviously right away one's going to

225
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,880
assume well it should be obvious it

226
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,479
should be the same thing because the

227
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
australian is leading the payer all of

228
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
you versus the dollar so therefore the

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
australian underlying futures contract

230
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
should be in fact the same thing we see

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
in the foreign exchange market and by

232
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
far and large it that's true but there

233
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
are certain data points that you cannot

234
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
get by looking at the foreign exchange

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,960
market there's simply no way of getting

236
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
that because foreign exchange doesn't

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
give you volume it doesn't give you

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
accurate volume like you can get volume

239
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,360
from the underlying futures contract

240
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
and we'll talk more about that as we go

241
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
but i want you to take a look at this

242
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,919
chart here okay and i'm looking at a

243
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,840
little bit less than six months i wanted

244
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
to show just this data range because

245
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
outside of this the chart becomes spotty

246
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
because it is a futures contract and

247
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,640
it's march delivery that means

248
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
prior to march we had december's

249
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
contract and that's already uh expired

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
and now we're trading in the nearby

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
contract which is march 2017 australian

252
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
dollar

253
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,320
when we taught or rather when i taught

254
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
the ipta data ranges okay obviously i i

255
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
asked everyone to hold off sending me

256
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
emails but some of you were just

257
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
overzealous and want to know it right

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
now and these are things that are going

259
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
to be building on your understanding as

260
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
we go through the mentorship especially

261
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
through january

262
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
but i want you to focus when you look at

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
your daily chart just simply go through

264
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
and look at the last three months okay

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
start whatever whatever time point

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
you're looking at like right now let's

267
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
assume we sat down with charts right now

268
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
and this would be the first day we're

269
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
looking at australian dollar we're a

270
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,200
brand new trader brand new to the

271
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
concept we're sitting down

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,279
how will we how would we go about

273
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
looking at where

274
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
the ifta data ranges are

275
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
and if we're looking at australian

276
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
dollar

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
you want to go from today's

278
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,519
uh candle which is what's being painted

279
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,560
here

280
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
that

281
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
and it's not a can i know it's open high

282
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
low close but you have to suffer through

283
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
that okay because i

284
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
had to get these slides together and i

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
promise there will be candlesticks shown

286
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
but for now i want you to focus on this

287
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
because the open high loan closes

288
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,279
important

289
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
the

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
most recent market shift okay in the

291
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
last three months occurred back in

292
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
november

293
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
now i know some of you that are hardline

294
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
critics are saying well here we go again

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
this is the hindsight thing

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
this is where hindsight is gold

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
you need to know what i'm going to show

298
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
you in this teaching because it will

299
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,399
clarify what the if the data ranges are

300
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
actually supposed to be doing for you

301
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
some of you are thinking that it's going

302
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
to call the high and low 20 days 40 days

303
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
and 60 days away that's not what happens

304
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
sometimes it can hurt sometimes it can

305
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,240
occur

306
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
but that's not what its job is okay

307
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
the the question that comes up a lot is

308
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
when i'm looking for a order block to

309
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
buy one or if i'm looking at an order

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
block to sell into or if i'm looking for

311
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,600
an area of buy stops or sell stops

312
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
which one should i expect them to go

313
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,839
after which one are they going to

314
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,320
respect how do i know if it's not going

315
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
to keep on going through an old high and

316
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
not be a turtle soup cell all those

317
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
scenarios and those ideas while i told

318
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
everyone in the beginning if you were

319
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
just patient and waited and

320
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,519
all those questions would be answered

321
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,040
but some of you are just really really

322
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
impatient and i get it you're excited

323
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
and you think that you're not going to

324
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
learn all this stuff in the remaining

325
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
time of the mentorship but trust me i'm

326
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399
committed you will learn it there's tons

327
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,399
of information coming to you but you

328
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
have to let me go through the process of

329
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
teaching it this isn't the first time i

330
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
taught this stuff to trust me i've been

331
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
successful in the past doing it okay so

332
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
just go along with the process

333
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
but if we look at back in november we

334
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
can clearly see that there was a major

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,079
market shift in november 2016.

336
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,240
now what that does it gives us a great

337
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
deal of insight we can't take a time

338
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,600
capsule travel back in time okay and be

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
back in november and go short there but

340
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
we can use the information that our

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
daily charts are telling us there that

342
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
means there was a great deal of

343
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
displacement

344
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
by the large players or smart money

345
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
when we see that

346
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
in november what we're seeing here is

347
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
the underlying futures contract of the

348
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,959
australian dollar has a market shift

349
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
right there that's a quarterly market

350
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,760
shift

351
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,079
over the last three to six months that's

352
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,120
the most

353
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
obvious one you can clearly see it if i

354
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,519
was to ask everyone if you're all in the

355
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
same room raise your hand if you can

356
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
clearly see that that is the most

357
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
obvious market shift in the last three

358
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
to six months everybody invariably would

359
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
raise their hand they would click

360
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,480
obviously if you can see it you can't

361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
deny it

362
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
that's what you're looking for every

363
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
three months there's going to be

364
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
something like this occurring it could

365
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
be a sell-off creating a high or it

366
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
could be a a low where it starts to

367
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,440
rally but every three months i want you

368
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,519
to look at your charts

369
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,959
and anticipate

370
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
finding that in hindsight

371
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
now great that's wonderful you can see

372
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
it in hindsight what do you do with that

373
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
information see this is what

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,839
i have an issue with like with elliott

375
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,480
wave and all these other

376
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
very

377
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,200
they're just very highly subjective

378
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
if the market really is

379
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,399
influenced or controlled by smart money

380
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
or if there is what i'm telling you

381
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
there's an algorithm that controls what

382
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
price is going to do it's absolutely not

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
random it's predetermined it's it's

384
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
running on a script

385
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
that refers to specific data points that

386
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
it will go back to over and over and

387
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
over again

388
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,920
the ipta

389
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
data range okay

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
you have a 20 day

391
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,200
look back and cast forward

392
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
range you have a 40 day look back and

393
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
cast forward range

394
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
and then you have a 60 day look back and

395
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,560
cast forward range

396
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,519
what i'm suggesting to you is

397
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
if you are looking at price and you see

398
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
a for instance they have a market

399
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
structure shift here and the quarterly

400
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
shift occurs in november

401
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
that means that now the market is in a

402
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
cell profile from that point until it

403
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
gets to a level of significant counter

404
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
direction what would cause it to change

405
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,519
direction or consolidate that's the

406
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
other thing that's the vague green uh

407
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
not green but gray area in the analysis

408
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
sometimes you won't see a clear

409
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
retracement or correction opposite

410
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
direction for instance it's been going

411
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,079
down november it could have very easily

412
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
been consolidating here going into

413
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
january

414
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,320
okay

415
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
into february it doesn't need to be a

416
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
counter trend move like we're seeing

417
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
unfold here since the last week of

418
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,040
december it can be a consolidation

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
and as we go further into the content

420
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
for the january uh delivery of the

421
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
information we'll talk about when it

422
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
does or when to anticipate when it's

423
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
going to go into consolidation and not

424
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
have a

425
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
a counter swing

426
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
so back in november we see that there's

427
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
a high made

428
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
what's what's really going on that low

429
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
here is broken so we have a shift in

430
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
market structure and it breaks lower

431
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
we know that we can see it because it's

432
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
taken out an area of equal highs and we

433
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
pierced above that

434
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
taking out the buy stop liquidity pool

435
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
and that's seen here

436
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
that was the that was the basis and the

437
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,000
framework around what caused the market

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
structure shift

439
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,000
that quarterly effect comes in

440
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,959
uh to operation at that moment okay

441
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,519
where our eyes go immediately back to

442
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
november because you can clearly see it

443
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,240
when you see that and you delineate that

444
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
in your chart what you're doing is

445
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,760
you're now identifying the beginning of

446
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,800
november

447
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
so you have to have a basis point where

448
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
where is it where did it all begin

449
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
because if you don't get yourself in

450
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,639
sync with what ipda most recently did

451
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
and ipta is the interbank price delivery

452
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
algorithm that's for your notes again

453
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
you're going to delineate where the most

454
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,199
obvious one in the last three months has

455
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,279
been

456
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
then you're going to cast out

457
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
20 days

458
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
go forward

459
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
from the beginning of the the month that

460
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,519
that market structure shift or quarterly

461
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
shift takes place you're going to count

462
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
out 20 days now it may not even be

463
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
20 days you may look at the chart and

464
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,079
say hey this is an obvious one right

465
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,920
here something's really going on

466
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
if you do that you're really

467
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
doing too much anticipation

468
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
you got to go back to the most obvious

469
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
one and it may require you going back

470
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
three months

471
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,320
but find the most recent one where the

472
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
market structure has shifted and there

473
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
was a move that took place that was

474
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
obvious bullish or bearish okay

475
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
and it's really easy if you just divide

476
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,880
your your daily chart into

477
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,279
uh quarters like put one put a line on

478
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,440
march put a line on uh june and

479
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
september december and just keep doing

480
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
that your your eye will go right to

481
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,399
where

482
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
these uh quarterly shifts are happening

483
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,279
they're not going to always occur on

484
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,959
those months there's a little bit of

485
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,160
gray area which is the reason why we

486
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,600
have a look back and cast forward

487
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
the ipta data range okay what it's

488
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,560
really doing is it's highlighting

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
you as the trader you're going to try to

490
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
mimic what this algorithm is doing

491
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
it's looking for

492
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,959
the liquidity

493
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,799
in the range of 60 days in the past

494
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,280
where is the sell stops in the last 60

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
days

496
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,720
where are the buy stops in the last 60

497
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
days

498
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,039
where are the fair value gaps where's

499
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,959
the price gaps that price has not been

500
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,720
efficiently delivered in the last 60

501
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
days

502
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,440
where are the

503
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
the liquidity voids where price has only

504
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
been delivered on the upside where it

505
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
has to come back down to efficiently

506
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,480
deliver price and balance it out

507
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
by going back down and closing in that

508
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,919
range

509
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,200
optimal trade entries that's where that

510
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
comes from

511
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
where are

512
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
the equilibrium price points

513
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
does it have to return back to

514
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,799
equilibrium did we get too far ahead of

515
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,880
ourselves do we extend too far do we

516
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
have to come back and retrace minor

517
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
retracement before we see the next leg

518
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,480
lower by looking at the

519
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
market structure shift that takes place

520
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,120
in this november time period we are in

521
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,799
instance saying that this is a quarterly

522
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,679
shift

523
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
therefore because of the daily chart

524
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,320
this is going to give us insight about

525
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
what the market should do on a

526
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
three-month timeline as much as six

527
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,000
months

528
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
but i like to just remind you that i'm

529
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
only really looking for

530
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
about three months horizon time horizon

531
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
that far out i don't like to look beyond

532
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,440
that there's many many times i can show

533
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
you in journals where i had it right but

534
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,280
i really just because i had it right

535
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,559
doesn't mean i was executing on every

536
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,000
trade

537
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but many times i'm really accurate in

538
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,480
about four to six weeks time horizon and

539
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
it's about the half-life of a

540
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
three-month cycle

541
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
so if i think that the time horizon is

542
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,039
consistently derived at by looking at

543
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
three months out by using the daily

544
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
chart like this

545
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
that's my belief i'm firm in my belief

546
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
that i believe i can teach you how to do

547
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
that and have a three-month horizon by

548
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
having that that is a great deal of

549
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
opportunities for all

550
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
disciplines of trading long-term

551
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
positions swing short term intraday

552
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
scalping all that stuff can be done

553
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
effectively by having this time horizon

554
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,720
but when we find the

555
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
clear market structure

556
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
shift that happens every quarterly

557
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
every three to four months or so we find

558
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,919
it we identified the beginning of that

559
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,840
month you gotta roll back to that first

560
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
month why are we doing that why does it

561
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
have to go back to the first month

562
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
first of the month rather because if an

563
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
algorithm and i'm not sure if any of you

564
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,840
are aware of

565
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
how computer programs are made or

566
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
designed but

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,799
when a systems analyst

568
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
sits down with a company and they say

569
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
okay look this is what i want

570
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
the output to be or i need a a report

571
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
generator that's it's going to give me

572
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
this outcome or i need this information

573
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,640
or i need this computation made i need

574
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,559
this process done

575
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,720
okay the system that's a system analyst

576
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
is going to say okay

577
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,640
what

578
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,960
what data points are

579
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,039
you making available to me so i can sit

580
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,480
down with my team of computer

581
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
programmers okay and the analyst will

582
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
make a documentation stage where he sits

583
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,720
down and outlines the overall macro

584
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
process

585
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,640
now

586
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,799
because of what they're dealing with

587
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
they are taught and learn computer

588
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
programming to some degree but they are

589
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
not doing the programming

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
they put all of the

591
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
context around what is supposed to

592
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
happen what processes are there

593
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
if this is done then this should be done

594
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
as well what checks and balances and

595
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
it's basically the documentation stage

596
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,159
of

597
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,640
the process of a computer program then

598
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,159
the computer programmers take that

599
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,000
information and they actually code it

600
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
out now

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,559
a

602
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,240
computer program and a computer

603
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,039
programmer is completely utterly blind

604
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
and useless if he doesn't have data

605
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,799
points to use

606
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
you can't have a computer program do

607
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
anything of any value unless it knows

608
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
where to draw

609
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
data points from there has to be an

610
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,840
array of information coming to it to

611
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,159
process and do calculations so my here's

612
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,960
my

613
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
this was my epiphany okay when i was

614
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
sitting down with

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
the folks that were introducing these

616
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
ideas to me

617
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,840
and know they're not in the teaching

618
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,799
circuits you're never going to meet

619
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
these people okay but

620
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,799
when i was introduced on how

621
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,679
the markets actually work and operate

622
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,480
the the fast thing i the fastest and

623
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,640
most obvious thing i learned was

624
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
there was no

625
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,039
ambiguity to how price moves around

626
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,960
there was no

627
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,559
randomness

628
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,880
because they were talking about things

629
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,679
that had a finite

630
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,240
or origination where it wasn't like it

631
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
could have been this day it could have

632
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
been that year it could have been this

633
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
month no no no no it's absolutely

634
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,799
nothing like that

635
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,480
if you understand that we're going to be

636
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
referring to things that are

637
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
numerical

638
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,080
they are price related

639
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,640
they are value based that means that we

640
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,080
have to look at a specific level and

641
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,039
price

642
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,760
but

643
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
how does the algorithm go just to end

644
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
the old price how does the algorithm

645
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,280
know that yet that that's where the

646
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
large fund stops are

647
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,280
see this is what's taught and permeated

648
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,159
in the teaching uh circuits in in

649
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,240
education for trading they teach and

650
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,000
i've said these things before but i used

651
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
it to communicate to you the idea

652
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
because most people don't understand

653
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
fund level trading they don't understand

654
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
institutional trading they don't they

655
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
don't know those types of things they

656
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
just think i got an account with my

657
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
broker so therefore i'm trading and if i

658
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,039
get stopped out it's my broker that did

659
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
it to me and many times that's true

660
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,400
but

661
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,919
the delivery of price from the central

662
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,120
bank level

663
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,480
that movement that repricing is really

664
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,720
not always but on the short term it's

665
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
being repriced

666
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,440
to take into account for large liquidity

667
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
pools that are available on the large

668
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,120
fund trading

669
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
realm not

670
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,360
your little mom and pop fxem

671
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,000
not your owanda none of those none of

672
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
those things okay are obvious or on the

673
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
radar screen for what i'm teaching you

674
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
here but they are in close

675
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
uh

676
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
they're basically in alignment with the

677
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
same thing okay but they're this these

678
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
movements for these runs on stops

679
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
they're not looking at oh here's michael

680
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
stop okay here's uh john jones from uh

681
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,440
allentown pennsylvania stops okay

682
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
they don't have that type of information

683
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
they don't see you they don't have any

684
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,280
identification of you they don't have

685
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,240
any identification to retail at all

686
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
but because these ideas are taught

687
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,880
across the board the same way because

688
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
it's been put out there to be done this

689
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
way because eventually if you're

690
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,919
if you are an accurate trader that's a

691
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
retail based trader okay

692
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
eventually if you're profitable to some

693
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
degree what eventually happens to some

694
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,600
of these people

695
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,559
they get

696
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,480
very high-minded of themselves they

697
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,559
think then they're great at what they're

698
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,240
doing so therefore they're profitable

699
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
and the first thing they want to do is

700
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
prove it to the world by having everyone

701
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
else give them their money and they're

702
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
going to be a trader that manages funds

703
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,919
no one wakes up and is born a large fund

704
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,960
trader

705
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
they come up through the ranks of being

706
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
a profitable retail trader so are they

707
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
going to come into that realm and change

708
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,400
the way they've been doing things

709
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
absolutely not

710
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
it's the same thing they're going to do

711
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,559
there then the difference is they have a

712
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,400
process on the fund level that they have

713
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
to go through specific parameters and

714
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
guidelines and stay within these to be

715
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
compliant with whoever is running that

716
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
uh that operation behind the scenes in

717
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
other words just because you're a large

718
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
fund manager unless you're operating

719
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
alone and independent if you go to work

720
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,720
for an agency and you are a fund trader

721
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
and you're managing under

722
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
their umbrella then

723
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
you have guidelines you have to work

724
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
within there's there's rules and things

725
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
that you can't do outside of these or

726
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
you're you're you know you basically get

727
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
canned you're out the door you're gone

728
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,039
you can't manage anything don't you know

729
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,799
they'll expel you

730
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,600
but

731
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,880
these ideas are the same so how can an

732
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
algorithm or a computer will just say it

733
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
like this how can a computer program

734
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,799
know where everyone's stop is

735
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,320
it has to have a range of data

736
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,039
now just because we have the the numbers

737
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,320
of price the value of price okay they

738
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,720
have to have a look back period

739
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
the look pack period is 20 days 40 days

740
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
and 60 days

741
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
and what you're doing is and this is

742
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,000
what i want you to do with your your

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
time after today's teaching while you're

744
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,159
waiting for today's daily recap video

745
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,919
because there'll be two bits go up this

746
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
is the teaching video for today and then

747
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
we'll have a daily review where i do

748
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
like 10 15 minutes talking about what's

749
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
already happened

750
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
and i'll give you the charts and stuff

751
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,799
to study

752
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
i want you to spend your time this

753
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
evening okay

754
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
and even tomorrow while we're not doing

755
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,840
any live session go back through your

756
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
charts and don't just look at the

757
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
australian dollar look at every currency

758
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,000
pair look at every commodity look at

759
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
individual stocks look at indices and

760
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
you'll see quickly by studying this

761
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
it will become quickly clear that

762
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
there's no randomness to it there's a

763
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,080
specific pattern that this thing does

764
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
all the time now it used to be

765
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,240
a manual thing where the market maker

766
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,440
was a real person they sat there and

767
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,679
they worked with a team of individuals

768
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
that manipulated price to do these very

769
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
things but because everything has become

770
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
so streamlined and efficient by

771
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
artificial intelligence ai the uh the

772
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
effectiveness of algorithms okay

773
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
that's been implemented now it's much

774
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,159
more efficient to do that and there's no

775
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,640
emotion it just does what it needs to do

776
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
so if it's a computer program or i'm

777
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
quoting with my fingers now the

778
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,360
interbank price delivery algorithm that

779
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
computer program we're going to call it

780
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
from this point on

781
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
for this teaching

782
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,520
for it to be

783
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,320
effective it has to know where to look

784
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
at

785
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
to find stops

786
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
they don't see orders

787
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,799
that's not what's going on they don't

788
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,480
see orders

789
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
the orders are executed on by the

790
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
traders at the bank level

791
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,880
the algorithm just permits the price to

792
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
move to that level which gives the

793
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
opportunity for the traders to execute

794
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
on that run

795
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
that's the real story that's what really

796
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,120
goes on everybody else out there in this

797
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,039
industry will tell you well it's this

798
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,039
happening and this this guy here he's

799
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
he's pushing a button and it's doing

800
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
this to have no it's not it's not that's

801
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,799
not what's happening at all

802
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,400
the algorithm will look back 60 days

803
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,720
and it'll find it's very easy if you if

804
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
you know anything about computer

805
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,400
programming

806
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
and you don't even have to do that but

807
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
just look at this

808
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,960
first of november

809
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
if you look back 60 days in the past

810
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,279
what was the highest high in the last 60

811
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,799
days

812
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,840
there's going to be buy stops above that

813
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,279
high what's the lowest low in the last

814
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,640
60 days

815
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
there's going to be cell stops below

816
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
that low

817
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,760
in the last 40 days what was the last

818
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,679
highest high and what was the last

819
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,200
lowest low

820
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
looking back in the range to the left

821
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,799
from that november red line that we're

822
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
dealing in november where are the stops

823
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,880
below and above those highs inside of

824
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
the range of 20 days

825
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,159
40 days and 60 days

826
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,440
now i already know what some of you are

827
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,960
thinking

828
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
what happens if there's a low

829
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
that's really really obvious that's just

830
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,399
outside the range of 60 days that's the

831
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
farthest extreme

832
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
that's when the open float will move

833
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,080
aggressively and go outside that normal

834
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,159
parameter of 60 days and you'll see that

835
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,200
big run

836
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
the market will jump

837
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
and skip right down into that old low

838
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
that's just outside that 60 day range

839
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
how do you know when it's going to be an

840
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
explosive move michael

841
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
when you have that scenario

842
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,039
if the last 60 days if they've already

843
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,320
ran out the the stops below and low in

844
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
the last 60 days

845
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,799
or above an old high in the last 60 days

846
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,080
and there is a larger higher high

847
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
or lower low where the stocks will be

848
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
resting above or below respectively

849
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
then you know there's going to be a big

850
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,760
run on price and they're going to run

851
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,279
for that liquidity

852
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,399
because that's the only other thing

853
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,679
that's left the large funds have their

854
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,559
orders above and below these old highs

855
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,760
and lows

856
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,960
you work just like the algorithm will in

857
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,760
a 60-day range look back the last 60

858
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,559
days

859
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,240
and then you watch going forward you

860
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,399
cast forward 60 days and you can

861
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
literally have this on your chart you go

862
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,799
forward count forward 60 days you can

863
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,360
literally go on your daily chart in mt4

864
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,240
and

865
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
change your date 60 days forward to make

866
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,640
a vertical line and that way as price

867
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
starts to paint you'll know you're

868
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
approaching that 60 day that means it's

869
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,399
going to be forming some measurable

870
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
intermediate term high or low before

871
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,039
that time

872
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,640
and it's going to create a liquidity

873
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,440
pool

874
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,760
above an old high or below no low that's

875
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
going to be influential for future

876
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,679
trades the same thing occurs by looking

877
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,679
back on the last 40 days

878
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,000
to the left of that november 1st

879
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
look back 40 days what was the lowest

880
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
low what was the highest low i'm sorry

881
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,039
what was the highest high rather and the

882
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,039
lowest low your buy stops above the old

883
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,679
high and the sell stops below that old

884
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,000
low inside of that range of 40 days

885
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
that's where ipta will look for that

886
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
liquidity now

887
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,840
it's not giving you directional bias yet

888
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,159
i'm telling you it needs to use these

889
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
reference points to find where the stops

890
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,799
would logically be see the ai cannot

891
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
it can't think

892
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
for a human

893
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
it can't do that but because human

894
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
nature says that we will as traders put

895
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,480
our sell stop below a low

896
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
and we will put a buy stop above an old

897
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,120
high

898
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,960
that's all the algorithms doing it's

899
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
seeking to take price to that level

900
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,200
when it gets to that level then

901
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,480
your broker

902
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,200
then the central bank can do a wild

903
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
spike

904
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,919
and send it above 10 to 20 pips

905
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
think about it now 10 to 20 pips then

906
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
becomes logical why they do those big

907
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
spikes okay intraday

908
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
20 and 10 and 20 pips above and over

909
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,520
high then it stops rate many times rate

910
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,919
at 20 pips or 10 pips and then rejects

911
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,279
it goes the other way

912
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,440
it first has to get to those levels

913
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,080
based on a daily chart in the realm of a

914
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
20 pip

915
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,039
40 i'm sorry 20 day 40 day or 60 day

916
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
look back and then cast forward so

917
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,440
really what you're doing is you have 120

918
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,120
days of range from the past and going

919
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,559
forward there's going to be a

920
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,240
significant move now some of your press

921
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
of course there's going to be a move

922
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,919
michael come on i mean a lot can happen

923
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,919
in 120 days yeah you're right

924
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,760
but there's things that you have to look

925
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
for that the algorithm is going to be

926
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,399
doing

927
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,600
to engineer these types of moves

928
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
you have to have these data points to

929
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,760
know why the market's going to go at an

930
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,080
old low what old low well where's the

931
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,559
lowest low in the last 20 days

932
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
where's the last 40 days where's the

933
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,120
lowest low in that range where's the

934
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
highest high in that last range and you

935
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,200
need to be noting those because that's

936
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
the one that they're going to run

937
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,919
they're going to run rate for those

938
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
if there isn't anything that hasn't been

939
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,279
traded to in the last 60 days if

940
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,120
everything's been wiped out above and

941
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,480
below the marketplace in other words the

942
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
open float all the buy stops above old

943
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
highs and all the sell stocks below all

944
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,799
those in the last 68 darn your look back

945
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,080
in other words everything to the left of

946
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,399
that november vertical line at red line

947
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,720
if everything's been cleaned out

948
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,519
above and below the highs and lows

949
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,440
there's no more buy stops there's no

950
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,480
more cell stops it has to create a new

951
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,159
expansion

952
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,039
so you have to identify what the next

953
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,919
high

954
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,480
and low outside that range of 60 days

955
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,960
looking back where that is

956
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,159
and that's going to tell you where

957
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,760
they're going to draw a price on this

958
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
daily time frame

959
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
it's more it's more confirmed when you

960
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
start applying it to the weekly chart in

961
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,480
the monthly chart because you'll start

962
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,880
seeing things align where that old low

963
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,519
that's just outside of the last 60 days

964
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,799
looking back

965
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,159
there's an old low that may not be on

966
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,279
this chart here i don't know i'm just

967
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,360
giving you a hypothetical

968
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,720
example

969
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,799
if there's an old load it's just outside

970
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,880
the realm of september in this example

971
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
here say maybe there's august there's a

972
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
significant lower low

973
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,679
the market's going to reach for that

974
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,840
there may be a high that's just outside

975
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
the september boundary in august

976
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,919
they may have

977
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,519
turned around here

978
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
and they make a run for that maybe it

979
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,279
may be in the 78th uh price range for uh

980
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,799
for aussie

981
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
that's what you would be noting and

982
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,519
you're going to look for price to be

983
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,519
drawn to one of those two price points

984
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,360
and you look for evidences that that

985
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,440
institutional order flow is going that

986
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
direction then you know where it's going

987
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,279
it gives you directional bias because of

988
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,840
the higher time frame nature of this

989
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
daily chart and weekly and monthly

990
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,239
so

991
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,918
what we have here this is the

992
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,359
look forward okay or cast forward of

993
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,480
november

994
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
this is 20 days out

995
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,960
from the 1st of november so we have 20

996
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,639
days here

997
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
inside of that 20 day range there's

998
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,359
going to be a significant setup that you

999
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,399
can use for your trading it's moving up

1000
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,839
into the old load that was formed in

1001
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
october

1002
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,599
it goes into consolidation well here we

1003
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,679
have a condition where the market didn't

1004
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,639
create

1005
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,800
any significant shift

1006
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
but it starts to move in consolidation

1007
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,639
then you count forward okay from here

1008
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,320
that's the 20th

1009
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,599
so you can go from the beginning of

1010
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,760
november to the 20th yes there was a

1011
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,960
price swing

1012
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,119
but using the information next stage

1013
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
would be 40 days out from that price

1014
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,480
point of november beginning we have here

1015
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
that is your 40-day lookout

1016
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,640
or cast forward

1017
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
and you're looking for

1018
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,119
again a potential major

1019
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,280
shift quarterly it can happen at that

1020
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
point now it didn't give you the lowest

1021
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,480
low because if you go back to the left

1022
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,760
two two daily candles or bars the last

1023
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
down

1024
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,119
right here

1025
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,760
this down candle that was the actual low

1026
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,200
we had a small little range in here and

1027
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,880
then we came down and hit this level

1028
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,560
here 71.50

1029
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
that's the 40 days out

1030
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
from the beginning of november

1031
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,200
framed on the

1032
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,359
quarterly shift that took place here

1033
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
so we're anticipating a potential change

1034
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,040
in in the direction okay

1035
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,920
20 40 or 60 days out

1036
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,480
but that's the range it's not always

1037
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
going to do like what you're seeing here

1038
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
where it's almost calling the very day

1039
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,320
it moves and makes the change

1040
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,880
it's you're allowing your study to say

1041
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
okay the price is going to move about 20

1042
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
days and then we could see something if

1043
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
it doesn't happen in 20 days okay well

1044
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,640
in the next 20 days up to 40 days from

1045
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,520
where the market structure

1046
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
last shifted here quarterly then we're

1047
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,520
going to anticipate

1048
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
in the realm of the next 20 days it may

1049
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,480
happen

1050
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,320
so you have to be looking for signs that

1051
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,839
it's going to happen if you don't do

1052
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,960
these things

1053
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
you're going to marry the idea that the

1054
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,280
market's going to keep on going lower

1055
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,599
and never turn around

1056
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,200
it doesn't it doesn't do that mark is

1057
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,040
not trading straight lines

1058
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,640
so if we see here

1059
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
on this day here this is 40 days out

1060
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
from the beginning of november

1061
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,560
very significant price move occurred

1062
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
from that price

1063
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
71.50

1064
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
i mean i would think everyone if we were

1065
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,640
all in the same room if we raised our

1066
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
hand if we were in agreement i think the

1067
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
majority of us if not all of us would

1068
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,040
raise our hand say that's a pretty

1069
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,760
significant move off that level

1070
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,280
one of the things i learned when i was

1071
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
an indicator based trader i'd like to

1072
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,640
stochastic i like

1073
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
larry williams accumulation distribution

1074
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,640
formula where it plotted an accumulative

1075
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,560
line based on the relationship to open

1076
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,359
the close and closed open and measuring

1077
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
that as some smart money buying and

1078
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
selling well

1079
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,720
sometimes that's true

1080
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
not always and it didn't always give you

1081
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
a divergence

1082
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
i liked his william percent art and the

1083
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
reason why i liked his william percent

1084
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,560
are is because it has an uncanny ability

1085
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,960
to be one day before

1086
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,880
like if you look at stochastic you have

1087
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,599
to wait for the the candle to close and

1088
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,320
go to a new candle to see if the k line

1089
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
crossed the d line or d line across the

1090
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,760
uh the k line or whatever it is i don't

1091
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
even remember what it was anymore but

1092
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,560
the the trigger line that uses uh the

1093
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,480
idea behind a crossover for stats for a

1094
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,839
stochastic

1095
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,160
that has to happen after the fact well

1096
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,000
the market's already moved

1097
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,320
when i looked at the percent r

1098
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,480
what that did it gave me many times the

1099
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,560
day before the real oversold condition

1100
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,839
would happen for instance if the

1101
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,760
oversold condition existed in williams

1102
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
percent r

1103
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,160
today that means tomorrow it's probably

1104
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,440
still likely to go down just a little

1105
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,720
bit more but that's going to be the buy

1106
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,960
day that's a very low low

1107
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
well

1108
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,839
that same phenomenon sometimes occurs

1109
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,480
with these ranges 20 days out you may

1110
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,839
get

1111
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,000
the if it doesn't turn it may happen on

1112
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
the 21st day

1113
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
or it may occur on the 19th

1114
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,480
day

1115
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
when the when it does occur but that's

1116
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,160
not what you're relying on so it's

1117
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,240
important that while that may have magic

1118
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,839
in your chart sometimes you may see it

1119
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,400
happen it might do the very thing of

1120
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
turning on the 20th day or the 40th day

1121
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
or the 60th day and you saw that in my

1122
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,720
first teaching for the month i wish i

1123
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
probably would have stressed it more

1124
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,520
because everyone seems to think that

1125
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,119
that's what's going to happen i i'm not

1126
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
telling you the market turns every 20

1127
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,680
days every 40 days and every 60 days but

1128
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
it can and will sometimes do that what

1129
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,040
we're looking for is these quarterly

1130
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,599
shifts that take place once we identify

1131
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,480
one

1132
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,960
there's our beginning point okay but you

1133
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,560
have to roll back to the beginning of

1134
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
that month it occurs in it occurred in

1135
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,280
the second week of uh of the month of

1136
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
november so we're now we're calibrated

1137
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,839
now we can start going forward until we

1138
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,680
see a equal

1139
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
or counterparty

1140
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
uh to that move going lower it has to be

1141
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
a significant um

1142
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,040
you know retracement or correction or

1143
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,920
reversal it's indicating that here the

1144
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,000
last week of december why is it doing

1145
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,520
that because we've taken out december's

1146
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,200
high

1147
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
see that

1148
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,320
we're trading at a level where if this

1149
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
was continuously bearish

1150
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,760
it shouldn't be where it's at right now

1151
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,040
today

1152
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,839
okay

1153
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,680
but my point in drawing your attention

1154
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,359
to the 40 day is

1155
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,320
it was not the 40th uh i'm sorry it

1156
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,160
wasn't the fact that it made the lowest

1157
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,480
low and turned on that day but look at

1158
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,640
the low in proximity to the lowest low

1159
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,960
that was formed here inside to see this

1160
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,480
day here was inside the range of 40 days

1161
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,800
back to this point price point here so

1162
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
from this level of looking at the first

1163
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,079
day of november casting forward 40 days

1164
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,079
this whole turning point right here

1165
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,000
could have happened any time in the last

1166
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
40 days

1167
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,520
now again that for the summers that are

1168
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,599
cynical of course obviously this this is

1169
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,560
of no value it's a great deal of value

1170
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
because inside that 40 days just like

1171
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
when we look back for 40 days and look

1172
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
for the low for sell stops and we look

1173
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
for the high for the buy stops

1174
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,040
in this range here

1175
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
what is this

1176
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
that's a low

1177
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,680
below that low is going to be what

1178
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
cell stops

1179
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
yes we moved

1180
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,839
about 150 pips or so

1181
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,920
below that

1182
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,960
but we came to a level of 71.50 that's

1183
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
not

1184
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,200
random

1185
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
7150 is a significant level it's a mid

1186
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,599
figure level

1187
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,359
and it's happening at a time

1188
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,599
when inside of 40 days

1189
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,960
the if the data range is going to be

1190
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,119
looking to do something it has it has to

1191
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,280
do something every three months

1192
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
price is going to be

1193
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,359
pushed around it's going to be drawn to

1194
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,119
a level or it's going to repel from a

1195
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,000
level

1196
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,440
and it's based on what i'm telling you

1197
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,560
here it's seeking large fund liquidity

1198
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
now longer term where we're talking

1199
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,920
about monthly and yearly moves they are

1200
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
all driven by real fundamental things

1201
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
like interest rates

1202
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,319
but every quarter there's going to be a

1203
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,720
ebb and flow that takes place a rally

1204
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
and a decline when this occurs that's

1205
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,520
all short-term in nature when you look

1206
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,440
at long-term trends that

1207
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,599
go for five years or 10 years

1208
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,440
three months is nothing that's like a

1209
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,960
five minute chart on the scheme of a

1210
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,319
weekly chart it doesn't mean anything

1211
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,880
there's no significance to it at all

1212
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,839
long-term macro fundamentals okay are

1213
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,800
not

1214
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,839
impacted by three-month

1215
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,040
cycles they're not

1216
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,359
they can be used to get in sync with

1217
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,000
long-term macro fundamentals

1218
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,720
but

1219
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,760
the only fundamentals you're going to

1220
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,680
get from me is interest rates which is

1221
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,079
going to talk to you this month as well

1222
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,880
so again in summary the 40 days and i'm

1223
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,119
not done teaching but for 40 days

1224
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,520
this range we're looking back because

1225
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,359
you know here we have a new 40-day look

1226
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,440
we're casting forward 40 days so that at

1227
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,240
that moment we're gonna have that

1228
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,000
in our charts from this point here we

1229
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,160
know 40 days from then this is where we

1230
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,560
would have our expectation of a shift

1231
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,160
but we also because we can do that in

1232
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,119
advance we can now look back 20 days

1233
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,280
from there

1234
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,119
we can look 40 days back from there

1235
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,720
where's the lows and where's the highs

1236
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,640
think about that

1237
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,200
if we know at this point here casting 40

1238
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,440
days forward we can have a vertical line

1239
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,480
right here

1240
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,640
on our on our charts

1241
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,240
now to someone looking over your

1242
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,839
shoulder they'd be like why is that line

1243
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,040
even there why do you have a vertical

1244
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,319
line there

1245
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,599
i don't know

1246
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,200
i ain't telling you you weren't part of

1247
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,119
the mentorship

1248
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,800
but from this point here counting back

1249
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
that's good here's here's gotta count

1250
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,480
this day as day one one

1251
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,319
two three four five six seven eight nine

1252
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,640
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20. okay

1253
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,680
to 20 is basically the the last day

1254
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,000
before you get to december so the second

1255
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,079
to the last day of november is 20 days

1256
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,319
back

1257
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,319
what was the highest high

1258
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,960
formed in that range

1259
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
it's going to be mid july uh mid

1260
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,160
december where it made those equal highs

1261
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,440
so there's going to be what's resting

1262
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,480
above that

1263
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,520
buy stops so what is the ipta algorithm

1264
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,800
going to do

1265
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,440
it's going to seek that liquidity it's

1266
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,520
going to go up there and take that

1267
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,440
which high should i look for michael

1268
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,839
that one

1269
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,480
looking back from this point here

1270
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,760
because we know it from this point here

1271
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
casting forward

1272
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
40 days okay going back 40 days well

1273
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
that's going to be in the range that's

1274
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,680
delineated here with this line that

1275
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,880
we've already shown this is the low

1276
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,160
is there any significance about that low

1277
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,400
well i'll count you to go into your

1278
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,560
4 hour 1 hour and 15 minute time frame

1279
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,760
and put up 7300 on your aussie dollar

1280
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
and see what you see

1281
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,400
there's nothing random about this stuff

1282
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,720
folks

1283
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,400
that low is 40 days inside the 40 day

1284
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,480
range okay that is a

1285
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,960
significant turning point it's not the

1286
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,480
very lowest low

1287
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,319
but you can see that the low forms two

1288
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,319
days before that and then we have a

1289
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,560
market structure shift

1290
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
and the market starts to go opposite to

1291
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,119
what has been put in place in november

1292
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,000
you can now also from that price point

1293
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,760
there by having a vertical line on the

1294
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,680
arrowed

1295
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,160
daily range you can now start counting

1296
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,359
forward 20 days 40 days

1297
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,640
60 days

1298
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,960
until you see an obvious

1299
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,520
shift quarterly

1300
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,680
there's a major structure shift okay it

1301
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,280
could be bullish or bearish whatever one

1302
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,560
it happens it doesn't make it that

1303
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,400
you're not trying to forecast that

1304
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
all you're doing is anticipating another

1305
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,599
significant move in price on a daily

1306
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,680
chart and it happens every three months

1307
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,000
but the point is the

1308
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,920
the if the data ranges

1309
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,400
give you a means of looking back

1310
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
20 40 and 60 days from specific

1311
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,119
days and specific price points

1312
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,800
because then you'll know what stops

1313
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
they're going to be reaching for

1314
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,720
above the old high and below an old low

1315
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
it's not just well i'm looking for the

1316
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
most recent obvious high and low no no

1317
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
no no it's not like that at all it's not

1318
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,400
like that at all you got to look back in

1319
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,960
a range of 20 40 and 60

1320
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
and then if all those levels have been

1321
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,160
cleared out then you gotta look outside

1322
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
that range then you know you're getting

1323
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,520
may see a big move

1324
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,359
and if it has these

1325
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,960
characteristics then you know you're

1326
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
going to see a larger move higher or

1327
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,760
lower based on what those

1328
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,680
uh highs and lows would be outside the

1329
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,839
most recent 60-day look back

1330
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,599
all right so this is the australian

1331
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,440
dollar

1332
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,960
candlestick you can

1333
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,720
uh rest your eyes a little bit and then

1334
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,920
we're straining your eyes on the open

1335
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
high-low enclosed bar

1336
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,119
here's that 70-50 level okay and why is

1337
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,599
that significant here we have a old

1338
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,079
low back in

1339
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,480
february of 2016 we have a last down

1340
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
candle but that last down candle

1341
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,040
has a range in it okay let me show you

1342
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,319
again this is what it looks like that

1343
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,200
wick

1344
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
right in here

1345
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,119
right here look at that price movement

1346
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,000
up

1347
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,599
right before

1348
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,960
the last it was the last week of

1349
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,880
february the big green candle right

1350
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,839
there

1351
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,400
we know that prior to that we saw

1352
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,480
the down close

1353
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,440
and that explosive range higher

1354
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,280
that high is going to be significant

1355
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,520
it's going to be sensitive okay but all

1356
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
the way down into the opening of that

1357
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,839
weekly

1358
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,319
range also notice that this last down

1359
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,599
candle here

1360
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,440
right before this big move up in the

1361
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,359
last week of may of 2016 that last red

1362
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,040
candle

1363
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,800
that was the bullish order block as well

1364
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,079
so we have a big range to work within

1365
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,720
then going into the latter portions of

1366
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
2016

1367
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,200
the

1368
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,000
last down candle in december

1369
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,359
that would be a bullish order block as

1370
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,400
well

1371
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,359
looking at the the high and the open on

1372
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,680
that candle would give you significant

1373
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,680
price points to go forward as well but

1374
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,760
look what happens when price hits this

1375
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,839
70 150 level it's been down here before

1376
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,680
and they repelled aggressively away from

1377
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,480
that

1378
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,800
fundamentally must be something to it i

1379
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,640
don't know what it is but on a weekly

1380
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
chart we're going to be using old highs

1381
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,240
and old lows

1382
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
and if those old highs and old lows had

1383
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,079
significant buying and selling pressures

1384
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,319
it's evidence and you can see it here we

1385
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,480
have to be mindful of that

1386
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,319
and you can see that they have in fact

1387
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,319
traded down there we tapped it two times

1388
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,319
on a weekly basis

1389
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,000
and then moved out

1390
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,079
once we moved out away from that level

1391
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,119
you'd see that they're going to be

1392
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,240
looking to do what they're going to be

1393
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,359
trading

1394
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,400
above

1395
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,599
these candles bodies

1396
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,400
and the wicks are next

1397
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,760
and we could potentially trade up into

1398
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,839
this last up candle

1399
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,559
in the last week of october of 2016.

1400
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,160
that's where the bearish order block is

1401
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
so we have a range that potentially

1402
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,359
could take us up into 75 70 to 75.80

1403
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,559
still

1404
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,359
for australian dollar

1405
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,760
let's go back into

1406
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,359
the daily

1407
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,800
or australian dollar and i want you to

1408
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,839
take a look at this chart for a moment

1409
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,119
stare at this for a second tell me what

1410
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,240
you see

1411
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,800
okay this is again this is the

1412
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,640
march contract for the australian

1413
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,520
futures market

1414
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
it's going to basically do the same

1415
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,839
thing our australian dollar pair does in

1416
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,119
forex

1417
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
but what you're seeing here cannot be

1418
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,640
seen

1419
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,040
in trading forex and er all these guys

1420
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,119
that get on facebook and on the internet

1421
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,240
and twitter and they know everything

1422
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,160
about forex and they know the insides

1423
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,640
and then and everything that's secret

1424
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,440
okay the buzzword smart money and now

1425
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,079
it's institutional trading everything is

1426
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,599
making its way in everybody else's

1427
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,040
curriculum now

1428
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,480
but

1429
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,240
none of them talk about this

1430
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,280
okay and this is where i learned the

1431
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,680
things that larry williams taught in his

1432
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,800
book

1433
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,720
how i made a million dollars trading

1434
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,800
commodities last year wrote that book in

1435
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,040
the 70s folks you know we're in 2017 now

1436
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,920
very very few things have the longevity

1437
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,079
of what has been taught in his book i

1438
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,200
mean for

1439
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
less than it costs for a pair of shoes

1440
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,839
today

1441
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,599
you literally can buy a book that if you

1442
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,280
have no understanding about how

1443
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,359
commodities move and how they're priced

1444
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,440
and all that business uh to me i think

1445
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,920
that is an essential part of every

1446
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,400
trader's library again the title is how

1447
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,599
i made a million dollars trading

1448
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,839
commodities last year by larry williams

1449
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,040
in his book

1450
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,520
he talks about how he was taught he

1451
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,839
didn't discover it he was taught this by

1452
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,200
his friend

1453
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,880
and i think if i'm not mistaken i think

1454
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,559
he names his friend in that book but the

1455
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,520
uh

1456
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,119
if not you can find it on youtube you do

1457
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,880
a search on larry williams and open

1458
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,480
interest but the

1459
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
the fact that open interest is the most

1460
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,520
misunderstood

1461
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,400
data point in trading is

1462
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,000
a wonderful opportunity for you as a

1463
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,920
trader

1464
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,240
if there is now thing think just for a

1465
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,400
second

1466
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
if there is

1467
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,280
100 control over price

1468
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,240
there has to be someone controlling it

1469
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,760
we're going to globally call that smart

1470
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,359
money

1471
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,200
if they are controlling it

1472
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,839
why would they want to control it

1473
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,760
greed

1474
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,880
they want to make money just like

1475
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
anybody else does banks are not in the

1476
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,040
business to go out of business they're

1477
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,280
in business to buy and sell money

1478
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,400
or

1479
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,760
provide means for you to borrow money to

1480
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,920
pay them interest on the usage of that

1481
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,599
money

1482
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,800
that's just one facet of it there's also

1483
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,640
speculation

1484
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,240
that is the mis

1485
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,079
most misunderstood realm because it's

1486
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,240
not widely talked about you have to be

1487
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,359
in that

1488
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,920
arena you have to be there to know

1489
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,319
anything about it and you are forced to

1490
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,319
not talk about anything

1491
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,119
so

1492
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,960
i had to create a

1493
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,520
language if you will okay to be able to

1494
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,480
talk

1495
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,119
where the things i understood

1496
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,040
are effectively communicated

1497
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,280
but also doesn't put me out there where

1498
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,839
i'm in trouble

1499
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,599
that's why we are in

1500
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,359
this teachings uh this this medium

1501
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,040
the things that i

1502
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,200
quickly learned that were apparent in

1503
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,359
the marketplace is that yes

1504
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,559
there is a entity out there that is 100

1505
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,000
interested in offsetting large funds

1506
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,559
because they have real huge orders in

1507
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,720
the marketplace and if they can upset

1508
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,119
them or take them out of the marketplace

1509
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,440
they know that their viewpoint will

1510
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
eventually get back in line because

1511
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,160
they're trend filing in nature they can

1512
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,319
take them out of the move and take their

1513
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,440
seat in that position or they can take

1514
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,760
them in the wrong side of the move

1515
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,839
and then reprice aggressively the other

1516
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,559
way and they can profit from that

1517
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,040
they're not looking at owenda or fxcm's

1518
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,880
books and saying okay well you know

1519
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,079
we're going to really punish retail

1520
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,359
today retail is just following the you

1521
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,640
know the blind

1522
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,119
leader of all these textbooks

1523
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,480
all that stuff

1524
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,280
you know that leads you to losses that's

1525
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,400
a

1526
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,640
derivative of you doing what you've been

1527
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,839
told to do

1528
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,720
and it doesn't have any basis in how the

1529
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,160
markets actually work

1530
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,480
once in a while they will work

1531
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,000
but you're not it's not because that it

1532
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,280
didn't happen because the divergence

1533
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,800
isn't stochastic it didn't happen

1534
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,960
because your wolf wave or your harmonic

1535
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,800
crab riding on the back of an eagle's

1536
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,240
wings pattern doesn't that doesn't

1537
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,800
happen okay price is moving based on

1538
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,559
where the large funds orders are where

1539
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,480
that open float is

1540
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
on these higher time frame charts that's

1541
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,040
what's drawing price but because

1542
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,280
the price is going to allow

1543
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
the bank level traders to get in and

1544
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,480
build positions in otherwise

1545
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,640
if it was really just the central banks

1546
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,760
repricing

1547
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,920
it would be like all the time big moves

1548
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,680
moving up to an old high then down to an

1549
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,040
old low

1550
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,920
the traders have to have a opportunity

1551
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,000
to work inside that position to

1552
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,839
capitalize on the move that ifta is

1553
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,720
engineering for them

1554
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,960
how do we know when the banks

1555
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,040
smart money are actually going in and

1556
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
buying if we know that there's a

1557
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,760
likelihood that 71.50 when aussie dollar

1558
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,240
is potentially bullish

1559
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,800
what evidence is there that there is in

1560
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,359
fact smart money buying it

1561
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,200
well inside that blue shaded area in

1562
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,359
here i have a great

1563
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,040
deal of insight to share with you and

1564
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,480
some of you already know some about

1565
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,920
something about this but i want you to

1566
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,119
think about this

1567
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,079
every

1568
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,520
three months this occurs

1569
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,280
write this down your notepad

1570
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,839
if you're busy changing diapers okay

1571
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,200
doing dishes

1572
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,839
hiding from your boss write this down

1573
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:34,800
every

1574
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,200
three months

1575
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,319
this pattern occurs

1576
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,200
where you're at a support level

1577
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,000
a major higher time frame support level

1578
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,240
if you see an expectation that price

1579
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,680
should be bullish

1580
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,640
we have been trading lower

1581
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,599
and

1582
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,119
we hit the level like we're seeing here

1583
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,359
at 71.50 as we just let me go back one

1584
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,720
more time to show you the weekly chart

1585
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,559
there's that 7150 level down here we've

1586
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,800
been there before in

1587
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,040
may okay so look at that level here you

1588
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,440
can see that

1589
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
7150

1590
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,880
that level

1591
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,480
has been hit perfectly his nails it okay

1592
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,319
and it runs away as price hit it

1593
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,720
as price hit this level here

1594
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,480
this purple line in here i want you to

1595
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,559
look at what was going on as price was

1596
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,800
dropping down

1597
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,920
okay

1598
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,680
all through this market structure shift

1599
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,680
in november okay

1600
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,000
what's happening here

1601
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
yes prices repricing going lower it's

1602
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,160
allowing bank level traders to be short

1603
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,000
and capitalize on that move

1604
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,839
but also open interest is also

1605
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,880
declining why why is that happening

1606
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,200
why is open interest declining

1607
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,520
when this moves dropping down

1608
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,319
what what significance is that

1609
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,920
because if you read larry williams book

1610
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,200
he says

1611
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,079
his buddy told him if the market is in

1612
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,880
consolidation

1613
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,760
all through here all between 77

1614
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,720
and

1615
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,839
74.50 for august september and october

1616
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,680
price was in a big trading range it's in

1617
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
consolidation

1618
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,280
then in november

1619
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,599
it creates a false breakout above 77 big

1620
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,599
figure and rejects and trades lower

1621
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,240
open interest is taught that as long as

1622
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,880
a trend is going up or down and you see

1623
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
open interest increasing as the trend

1624
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,119
goes that's a healthy trend that works

1625
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,520
for bull markets doesn't work for down

1626
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,880
markets

1627
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,839
that's a misnomer that's misinformation

1628
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,079
larry williams says when open interest

1629
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,880
drops while you're in consolidation

1630
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,319
we're in consolidation all through

1631
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,240
august september and october

1632
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,799
price drops down in here we have a big

1633
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,559
drop in open interest

1634
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,319
open interest

1635
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,920
is the total open longs and shorts that

1636
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,079
are in the marketplace right now

1637
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,760
if the central bank

1638
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,079
is the storehouse for price it's their

1639
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,240
currency it's their commodity

1640
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,079
if you are trying to buy

1641
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,160
currency it has to be made available to

1642
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,880
you

1643
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,040
and it's going to come from a bank

1644
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,680
if this would have been gold okay uh the

1645
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,079
commodity is gold is there's a a

1646
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,359
provider or a liquidity provider of gold

1647
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,000
okay you have to buy up this position or

1648
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,760
assume a position in gold well for

1649
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,079
australian dollar if you're buying that

1650
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,480
currency it has to come from somewhere

1651
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,359
it comes from the bank so if they are

1652
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,559
the liquidity provider for the price of

1653
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,240
australian dollar the central bank of

1654
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,359
australia if that bank is providing you

1655
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,520
the basis of the valuation on australian

1656
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,040
dollars

1657
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,040
they are essentially doing what

1658
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,880
they're the counterparty to all the

1659
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,400
large funds

1660
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,480
not always not 100 percent because you

1661
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,119
have all kinds of smaller entities and

1662
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,720
institutions that could take the other

1663
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
side of other positions but from for the

1664
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,839
most part

1665
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,920
view open interest as

1666
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,880
every trade that the central bank is

1667
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,200
providing counterparty to basically what

1668
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,640
a small brokerage firm would do with

1669
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,720
their own clients they are the liquidity

1670
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,319
provider well the central bank is the

1671
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,040
liquidity provider for australian dollar

1672
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,799
so if we see open interest increasing

1673
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,240
what does that mean that means the

1674
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,960
central bank is it's taking on risk

1675
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,880
it's providing liquidity

1676
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,799
for buyers of australian dollar

1677
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,119
if open interest has a

1678
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,599
15 or more

1679
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:38,720
drop

1680
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,280
or change lower like it does here this

1681
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,880
is extended this is a very significant

1682
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,920
drop

1683
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,040
while price is sideways this is bullish

1684
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,880
because what this is doing is

1685
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,920
every every time open interest increases

1686
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599
it's indicating that they have now

1687
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,319
provided liquidity for a buyer

1688
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,760
if they're not trying to provide

1689
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,359
liquidity for a buyer and they're trying

1690
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,319
to reduce their holding or exposure that

1691
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,240
means that they're not doing what to

1692
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,119
offer liquidity to a buyer they have to

1693
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,880
be a seller

1694
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,640
open interest reflects the selling side

1695
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,680
of a provider of liquidity

1696
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,440
if this open interest declines

1697
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
aggressively like this that's indicating

1698
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,640
they do not want to hold the heavy

1699
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,559
short position they would be having by

1700
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,079
being a provider for those that want to

1701
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,480
buy australian dollar

1702
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,640
you see it rally then

1703
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,839
but look carefully the extended trading

1704
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,319
range is months long what's going on

1705
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,960
that whole time from this point here

1706
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,440
they start building in positions

1707
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,200
they're selling this thing as it's

1708
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,280
creating higher highs it's coming back

1709
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,760
it's they're selling more of it here

1710
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,440
and they're selling more over here

1711
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,799
every peak

1712
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,400
in the open interest from the low it

1713
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,680
creates here

1714
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,000
every peak in it is a high

1715
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,079
they sold more here

1716
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,400
they sold more here right at this high

1717
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,000
they sold the most

1718
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,480
right there

1719
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,799
they're selling into that rally you

1720
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,720
don't get that from leah williams book

1721
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
you do get him saying open interest

1722
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,079
increases when we're in bearish markets

1723
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,240
and then for the consolidation it tells

1724
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,079
you if we see open interest increasing

1725
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,240
in a consolidation that means that the

1726
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,000
open interest is reflecting heavy net

1727
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,240
selling on the central bank level that's

1728
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,079
how i'm viewing it for currency trading

1729
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,839
but what he taught in his book was the

1730
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,319
commercial traders the large commercial

1731
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,799
users and producers of a commodity

1732
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,640
they're actually building in heavy short

1733
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,799
positions what i learned was by looking

1734
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,960
at open interest and matching up the

1735
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,119
highs to the peaks and open interest you

1736
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,160
can actually see where they did their

1737
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,319
cell programs that's a sell

1738
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,400
they're selling it here and in the very

1739
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,799
highest peak they sold it there now

1740
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,280
think about it if they sold it there and

1741
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,799
then we do have a market structure shift

1742
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,440
here are they gonna hold on to their

1743
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,880
short positions

1744
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,799
if they're naturally a hedger

1745
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,960
open interest is going to by natural

1746
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,880
order of things reduce as it's going

1747
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,079
lower because what are they doing

1748
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,760
they're covering those short positions

1749
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,520
they built in here that's what's

1750
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,960
happening all through this process of

1751
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,559
going lower

1752
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,640
open interest is declining you don't get

1753
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,720
taught in textbooks

1754
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,480
it's showing you that they are in fact

1755
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,240
in a cell program and they're profit

1756
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,400
taking as it's going lower lower lower

1757
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
lower lower open interest is going to

1758
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,440
decline

1759
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,680
then we hit a level like this

1760
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,599
major support are they going to want to

1761
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,000
hold on to a heavy

1762
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,920
net short position by offering liquidity

1763
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,079
to the buyers no way

1764
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,240
how do they upset that they do rapid

1765
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
price declines that knocks the desire

1766
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,559
for buyers that want to move away and

1767
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,920
get out of their way

1768
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,599
because they don't want to be a provider

1769
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,839
and by by providing the sell side to

1770
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,040
buyers

1771
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
they don't want that risk and that's why

1772
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,200
they do these massive sell-offs in price

1773
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,880
you see these big moves that jump down

1774
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,640
to specific levels and they just keep

1775
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,880
going lower and lower lower

1776
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,119
they do that to take away and control

1777
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,680
sentiment on the near term you may have

1778
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,359
been bullish back here

1779
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,720
well that goes away real quick when they

1780
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,720
do this

1781
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,480
and they would keep driving lower all of

1782
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,240
a sudden there's no support levels until

1783
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,400
you get down to 71.50

1784
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,119
they know buyers are going to come in

1785
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,280
so they have to reset and drop down

1786
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,119
quick boom they reset they take all

1787
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,839
their interest on being a sell side

1788
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,760
liquidity provider and drop it down to

1789
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,119
its lowest point

1790
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,799
why are they doing that

1791
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,200
because now their exposure

1792
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,119
is not here

1793
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,079
their exposure starts down here

1794
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,839
and they go back to that same cycle now

1795
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,839
everybody's signing a buy buy buy buy

1796
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,520
and they will provide that liquidity

1797
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,160
because they've already profited

1798
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,480
down here from back here

1799
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,200
back here and back here all in the last

1800
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,960
week of september the midpoint of

1801
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,880
october and the second week of november

1802
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
where they sold and built in their

1803
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,119
bearish positions

1804
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,079
the telltale sign is inside that support

1805
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,480
level at 71.50

1806
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,040
dovetailing this with if the data ranges

1807
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,359
and quarterly shifts we know that this

1808
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,680
is most likely going to occur and move

1809
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,280
all z dollar up

1810
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,799
and go back into the charts and go back

1811
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,000
into what i was talking about for

1812
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,520
australian dollar i told you that it was

1813
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,599
going to go higher this is not hindsight

1814
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,680
cherry picking i'm telling you why i

1815
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,520
said these things and what was behind

1816
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,359
the scenes that i can't go through i

1817
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:22,400
mean look how much we're talking about

1818
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,559
it now if i did this kind of talk on

1819
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,720
everything and every setup every single

1820
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,640
day i'd never get done i'd never see my

1821
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,520
wife

1822
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,359
and probably be divorced really quick

1823
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,240
but

1824
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,200
these are the things that you're going

1825
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,799
to do in your analysis it won't take

1826
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,799
this long obviously you'll know what

1827
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,240
you're looking for because of the

1828
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,640
teachings but the mechanics behind it

1829
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,359
all is that 7150 is support

1830
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,720
price on the weekly charts bounced there

1831
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,760
before

1832
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,079
we're in the low end of

1833
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,880
the the range for the weekly

1834
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,799
um

1835
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,559
um well

1836
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,720
the lowest point which has been in a

1837
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,480
long period of time going back to go

1838
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,680
back to your weekly chart that i showed

1839
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,400
here

1840
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,079
in your notes

1841
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,599
and you'll see that that's the lowest

1842
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,200
it's been in recent time in the weekly

1843
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,480
chart so therefore it would be

1844
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,079
reasonable expect to see some bounce at

1845
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,720
71.50 but i'm drawing your attention to

1846
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,119
that little area in december

1847
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,480
that little

1848
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,599
massive really it's a massive decline in

1849
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,240
open interest

1850
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,920
right there that purple line when it

1851
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,480
tanked went low real quick like that

1852
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,400
that's the central bank

1853
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,480
getting rid of any of their remaining

1854
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,240
short position so now they're they're

1855
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,400
done they completed their cell program

1856
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,240
first week of november

1857
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,880
mid part of december so now the they're

1858
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,720
ready they're prepared for buyers to

1859
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,079
come in

1860
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,240
they have reset their self there's no

1861
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,000
exposure on the upside

1862
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,160
okay against them by holding heavy heavy

1863
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,559
shorts so now they can start offering

1864
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,720
that liquidity from the low end because

1865
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,480
they made their book

1866
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,520
from 77.50 all the way down to 71.50

1867
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,960
600 pips

1868
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,559
and believe me they're moving size on

1869
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,079
all that

1870
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,359
so from that point on okay we had that

1871
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,760
delineation

1872
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,920
on this

1873
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,200
candle or bar remember earlier and

1874
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,240
looking back 20 trading days we put you

1875
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,079
right about in here that means the high

1876
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,200
is here

1877
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,000
that's where they're going to run

1878
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,440
liquidity

1879
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,640
that's where they're going to be seeking

1880
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,920
to take price

1881
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,440
now what does this mean for forex

1882
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,799
trading

1883
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,160
all right so this is what we've seen

1884
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,720
price do

1885
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,880
here's that

1886
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,480
40 day

1887
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,079
cast forward day

1888
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,599
that's the very day and this is that

1889
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,079
down candle or down open high low close

1890
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,839
candle that small little one and then

1891
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,160
here's the the last one or the 40 day

1892
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,559
look forward from the first of november

1893
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,960
price goes higher from there creates a

1894
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,400
down candle

1895
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,359
price moves above that candle

1896
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,200
here this becomes a bullish order block

1897
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,640
so if price was to ever come back down

1898
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,160
we could be a buyer there

1899
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,160
i said we'd like to see some bullishness

1900
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,000
on this candle here because we're on the

1901
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,839
left side of the curve this is all the

1902
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,599
cell side now if you're going to be

1903
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,880
bullish you're going to go look over

1904
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,599
here at every down candle

1905
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,119
there should be some bullishness in here

1906
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,480
we saw some of that

1907
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,799
they have a down candle here

1908
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,640
if we had a retracement i would like to

1909
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,720
see it price come back down here i would

1910
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,799
be a buyer that was a potential scenario

1911
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,039
that could have unfolded if it didn't

1912
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,839
and we blew out the high of this candle

1913
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,359
this down candle is going to be the new

1914
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,119
bullish order block

1915
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,839
so it's high comes in at 70 350 price

1916
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,079
comes down hits it here yesterday finds

1917
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,079
some sensitivity there and expands up

1918
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,640
and closes in the range the context of

1919
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,480
the move for australian dollar was i was

1920
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,400
not bearish australian dollar

1921
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,880
i did not have you set up to expect

1922
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,960
lower prices on the australian dollar we

1923
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,400
were looking for this thing to come up

1924
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,599
here and close in this range and

1925
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,200
potentially up into this bearish order

1926
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,839
block and it's now confirmed that it

1927
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,599
wants to go higher

1928
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,440
relative to the things we just said

1929
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,119
based on that weekly chart

1930
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,760
and we described on the futures contract

1931
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,400
on its own daily chart we had a mean

1932
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,039
threshold of the range from this candles

1933
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,599
open to this candles close that's what

1934
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,079
this range is here we've moved through

1935
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,480
that so now what is it indicating it

1936
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,079
wants to go higher what's it going to

1937
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,480
reach for it's going to look for a clear

1938
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,720
run above this high here

1939
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,000
because that's where the buy stops are

1940
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,960
resting

1941
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,039
they're not going to take it just to

1942
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,640
this level here and be satisfied if

1943
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,079
they're going to allow this move to take

1944
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,480
place they're going to punch it through

1945
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,720
equal highs now i know you're saying if

1946
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,200
you if you're new and you haven't really

1947
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
paid too much attention to

1948
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,799
and equal those and you're only looking

1949
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:43,839
for

1950
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,960
like a perfect equal candle height this

1951
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,119
is in my opinion this is an equal level

1952
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,960
it's so close to

1953
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,599
one another in terms of proximity

1954
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,640
if you look at the buys of the cam

1955
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,599
they're almost the same

1956
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,960
i mean look at that i mean we have the

1957
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,400
open on this candle and the clothes on

1958
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,760
this candle since it's the same thing we

1959
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,599
only have this one little wick so the

1960
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,240
liquidity really is

1961
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,400
above here

1962
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,240
and in my opinion it's going to go above

1963
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,799
this level here so that puts us around

1964
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:16,080
that 75 70 to 75 80 level like we talked

1965
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,279
about relative to that weekly chart

1966
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,198
so by taking this information and

1967
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,439
applying it to your charts

1968
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,679
it helps you map out while you have

1969
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,759
areas where yes this could happen we

1970
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,080
could trade down here but if it did we

1971
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,158
were buying we would be expecting to be

1972
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,880
a buyer down there it may not happen

1973
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,960
they may allow price to keep on going

1974
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,120
and give you no real retracement but you

1975
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,479
still had reference points to be

1976
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,000
watching and monitoring going forward

1977
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,158
this was the new down candle okay it's

1978
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:45,279
going to be a bullish order block so

1979
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,960
therefore we should not see this candle

1980
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,600
give way if it trades through it it did

1981
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,839
it traded above its high so now this has

1982
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,560
become the support level this level is

1983
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,560
where the banks are going to look to

1984
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,640
defend it on the downside so any

1985
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,960
movement into it like we see here

1986
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,279
this candle trades into the body and

1987
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,600
quickly rejects the next day it opens

1988
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,759
trades down it hits the bodies i'm sorry

1989
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,040
the candle

1990
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,279
it's high it's 73 55 goes a little bit

1991
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,359
below look at the low

1992
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,158
73 52 it only went three pips below the

1993
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,920
level we would be watching for and then

1994
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,839
look at the aggressive move through it

1995
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,080
trading in delivering price with a

1996
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,359
bullish side of price buy side delivery

1997
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,080
we had all down movement here between

1998
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,359
74 34 and 73.80

1999
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,839
prices moved

2000
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,920
from

2001
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,799
738-7434 yesterday

2002
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,920
so having that

2003
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,600
having that move from 7380 to 7434

2004
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,679
it closed in that fair value gap that

2005
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,440
we've we've been monitoring that

2006
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,640
occurred in december 2016 and then

2007
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,320
prices move through the mean threshold

2008
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,199
it's obvious that we'll see

2009
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:13,440
a move above that 75 25 level how much

2010
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,480
further

2011
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,440
like i said 75 80 looks likely

2012
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,600
and if we do that we could really make a

2013
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,960
run all the way up into uh

2014
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,480
76

2015
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:38,320
i'd say 76.50 so 76.50 is likely upside

2016
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,920
objective if we get really rolling

2017
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,239
higher but apart from that

2018
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,040
uh that that was the uh the dna or

2019
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,880
anatomy if you will of why the

2020
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
australian dollar moved up why we were

2021
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,199
expecting bullishness on it uh behind

2022
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,719
the scenes

2023
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,320
these higher time frame ideas that

2024
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,239
you're learning you have to learn to

2025
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,960
trust them on these monthly weekly and

2026
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,199
daily in applying open interest to

2027
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,560
levels that you would expect to see

2028
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,640
bullishness in

2029
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,800
every three months

2030
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,560
okay and this is the last point and

2031
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,719
we're going to close today's teaching

2032
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,400
the point at which

2033
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,120
these three month to four month moves

2034
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,040
that take place every quarter there's a

2035
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,080
major

2036
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,400
shift in market structure

2037
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,560
and while that may not undo the

2038
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,040
long-term bullish or bearish moves

2039
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,040
they are executable in a way where you

2040
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,040
can make great deal of money you can

2041
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,320
take a lot of money out of positions if

2042
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,239
you're properly aligned

2043
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,880
if you are not aware of these they will

2044
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,239
take you by surprise and you're like

2045
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,159
where'd this come from you know there's

2046
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,520
you know

2047
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,840
there's no worse feeling than

2048
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,640
expecting a move to go

2049
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,800
hard one direction and then see it do

2050
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,320
something like this like for instance if

2051
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,960
you're looking at this move here

2052
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,480
and say you were a

2053
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,560
fibonacci trader

2054
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,159
not necessarily optimal trade entry but

2055
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,159
say you were a fibonacci trader and you

2056
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,400
saw the 50 level here there's a guy on

2057
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,480
baby pips that makes a name for himself

2058
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,840
on trading at 50 level

2059
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,120
fibs and

2060
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,920
i i use that as equilibrium but

2061
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,120
you could be looking at that say okay

2062
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,239
yeah and this day you would have

2063
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,440
probably felt good about the whole idea

2064
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,640
of being bearish on australian dollar

2065
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,440
not

2066
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,760
by what we've been talking about and we

2067
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,360
mapped out very specific we even talked

2068
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,840
about that very day being bullish

2069
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,080
but in the retail mind

2070
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,000
this whole day right here that would

2071
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,840
look like okay well we have a double top

2072
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,880
now

2073
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,800
it's at a 50 level in the fib it's going

2074
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
to go down and trade down below here or

2075
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,360
i'll do i'll do an abcd type move and

2076
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,640
i'll be looking for

2077
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,000
70s on

2078
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,840
the australian dollar that's retail

2079
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,840
thinking we were not thinking that at

2080
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,760
all we're mapping that candle out as a

2081
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,440
reason to be a buyer

2082
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,880
so the things you're learning is

2083
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,640
completely diametrically opposed to

2084
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,679
those things that you learn in the

2085
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:54,960
retail world

2086
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,480
and it's like that because we have to

2087
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,640
capitalize on those ideas because those

2088
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,920
things permeate large fund trading where

2089
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,520
the buy stops where the cell stops it's

2090
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,960
the same way human nature is going to

2091
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,440
repeat itself every large fun trader

2092
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,679
starts as a low end trader just like you

2093
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,840
are right now just like i started

2094
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,760
grassroots we all start from the same

2095
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,520
place the beginning

2096
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,600
no one becomes a large fun trader

2097
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,360
managing billions and millions of

2098
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,880
dollars

2099
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,400
because you just felt like you want to

2100
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,640
do it today try it try today if you're

2101
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,199
successful today try to get a large fund

2102
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,719
traders position by the end of the month

2103
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,760
you can do that i'll send you one

2104
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,760
million dollars through paypal

2105
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,199
you have to do some things you got to

2106
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,000
prove

2107
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,760
you know you can trade okay and you have

2108
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,760
to go through a lot of uh rick morrow if

2109
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,199
you will if my if i can quote my

2110
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,040
grandmother to get

2111
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,120
to that that position

2112
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,560
you have to prove yourself it doesn't

2113
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,719
happen by accident so

2114
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,400
if they are doing the very things they

2115
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,000
did as a regular trader but they still

2116
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,719
have to do things with guidelines okay

2117
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,880
then

2118
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,719
it's common sense that their stops are

2119
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,800
going to be rate where everyone else is

2120
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,640
going to be placing their stops but they

2121
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,280
have a lot more money at risk

2122
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,360
they have exposure that you don't have

2123
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,440
you're trading micro lots and mini lots

2124
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,960
and all these other things and i'm not

2125
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,199
trying to disparage you or or you talk

2126
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,719
down to you because i started the same

2127
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,800
way i started with small stuff

2128
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,640
but they don't see you you're not even a

2129
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,199
blip on the radar screen but they do see

2130
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,040
these large pending orders above old

2131
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,080
highs and below lows in the last 60 days

2132
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,760
in the last 40 days

2133
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,760
in the last 20 days and once you find a

2134
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,520
time marker where you can delineate when

2135
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,600
there's a shift that has taken place or

2136
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,159
when you cast forward 60 days at that

2137
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,480
moment you know in the future 60 days

2138
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,560
from that last market structure shift

2139
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,960
quarterly you know that's a delineation

2140
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,360
in the in the future so you can already

2141
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,679
anticipate a significant move 20 days

2142
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,920
from that one back from it which would

2143
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,880
be

2144
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,520
not 40 days

2145
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,880
it would be

2146
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,760
20 days back from that new

2147
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,320
market uh delineation so for what i'm

2148
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,280
saying is

2149
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,960
by having these things on your chart

2150
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,719
you'll be able to look backwards and

2151
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,800
forwards and looking for the ranges just

2152
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,080
like the ipta

2153
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,159
algorithm will look for where the most

2154
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,880
recent 20 day 40 day and 60 day stops

2155
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,840
are

2156
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,679
if they have been cleared out on both

2157
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,679
sides of the marketplace

2158
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,120
once they have been wiped out and we're

2159
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,159
in equilibrium you have to look at where

2160
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,880
the next range high and low is outside

2161
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,239
of the last 20 i'm sorry last 60 days

2162
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,159
that will tell you where the next big

2163
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,840
significant move is going to be

2164
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,600
and if you combine that with weekly and

2165
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,960
monthly charts

2166
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,480
it's almost like a no-brainer you just

2167
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,400
have to wait for it to happen it takes

2168
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,560
time for that to unfold and most of us

2169
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,120
by human nature are not patient we're

2170
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,800
impatient some of the folks that have

2171
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,360
left this mentorship are classic

2172
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,679
scenarios of that they're just impatient

2173
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,199
they want to know it right away they

2174
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,040
wanted to learn it all in one month you

2175
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,320
know they stuck it out for the second

2176
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,600
month the third month the fourth month

2177
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,719
it was too much

2178
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,320
i can't wait for it i gotta go okay i

2179
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
gotta just gotta toss it in

2180
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,840
and they'll be they'll regret the rest

2181
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,360
of their life trust me they're gonna

2182
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,960
regret it when they

2183
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,400
look back they're going to feel like

2184
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,600
they've missed the opportunity of a

2185
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,280
lifetime and they have

2186
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,199
what you're learning you're not going to

2187
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,120
get that from anywhere else but it's

2188
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,360
going to require you to work for it i'm

2189
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,719
going to put your nose right where you

2190
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,159
need to be focusing

2191
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,400
but i cannot take away the lessons that

2192
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,440
by studying it will give you that has to

2193
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,600
happen by you doing it and if you can't

2194
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,800
be here in the live sessions they're

2195
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,480
recorded it's the same thing there's

2196
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,920
nothing different by watching the

2197
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,360
recording

2198
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,320
when we leave january's content

2199
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,760
we're gonna be applying all these things

2200
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,360
so that way when you start looking at me

2201
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,000
doing short term trading and weekly one

2202
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,719
shot one kill setups and we go deeper

2203
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,000
into the mentorship when we start going

2204
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,640
back into intraday trading you'll see

2205
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,040
all these things are the reasons why i'm

2206
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,440
being a buyer or a seller in london open

2207
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,440
or a buyer and seller in new york

2208
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,199
session and why these levels i'm keying

2209
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,040
off of and telling you everything that

2210
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
you saw us doing in the september month

2211
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,560
where we were nailing highs and lows

2212
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,280
what the market was doing almost daily

2213
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,520
all that was was me applying what i just

2214
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,360
showed you in this teaching

2215
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,040
i just didn't go through all the the

2216
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,360
mechanics behind it all i just knew it

2217
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,040
and applied it and just talked about it

2218
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,120
just you know whatever this is what's

2219
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,679
going on and it gives you a great deal

2220
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,520
of confidence and for some of you it

2221
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,480
will create an air of

2222
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,520
arrogance don't let that become

2223
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,280
don't let it define you but you

2224
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,199
definitely will have a

2225
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,480
level of confidence this goes through

2226
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,320
the roof because you're going to know

2227
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,520
with a great deal of

2228
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,840
trust that the market is trying to get

2229
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,320
to a level for a real reason

2230
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,920
and it's being manipulated it's being

2231
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,159
controlled it's being driven there it

2232
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,840
has no

2233
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,040
other way of

2234
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,840
operating except for over time

2235
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,520
price will

2236
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,600
agree on a level that's arrived at what

2237
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,239
ipda is seeking

2238
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,600
last 60 days where's the high and the

2239
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,880
low

2240
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,239
last 40 days where's the high and the

2241
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,199
low

2242
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,880
last 20 days where's the high in the low

2243
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,199
that's where your liquidity pools are

2244
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:09,520
okay last 20 days where is the gaps

2245
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,159
where are the gaps in the last 40 days

2246
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,400
where is the gaps in the last 60 days

2247
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,920
that's where all your fair value levels

2248
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,080
are

2249
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,280
think about it what's where's the

2250
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,800
consolidations in the last 20 days the

2251
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,719
last 40 days in the last 60 days that's

2252
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,000
where your equilibrium price points are

2253
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,040
going to be

2254
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,800
when the market isn't going to move it's

2255
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,719
going to gravitate and hang at those

2256
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,920
levels

2257
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,520
when you see me say i'm not doing it

2258
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,520
today the market's going to be sideways

2259
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,640
and you're all like well how did you

2260
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,760
know that

2261
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,719
this

2262
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,880
what i just taught you today how to use

2263
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,239
the data ranges house tells you what you

2264
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,320
should be doing should you be expecting

2265
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,400
range expansion on the upside

2266
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,679
should you be expecting range expansion

2267
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,000
on the downside that is directional bias

2268
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,760
that's are you bullish today or are you

2269
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,679
bearish today

2270
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,960
if you are not in a range where it's

2271
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,880
going to expand and you're hanging

2272
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,280
around equilibrium in the last 20 days

2273
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,960
the last 40 days and last 60 days in

2274
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,560
other words what's that look like if you

2275
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,800
go back 60 days and you see where price

2276
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,800
has made a small little trading range

2277
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,159
divide that range in half that's

2278
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,480
equilibrium if your price right now

2279
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,640
today is just hanging around and dollar

2280
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,159
index is not trying to move it's

2281
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,679
probably going to be a z day that means

2282
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:20,800
it's going to go up a little bit down a

2283
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,920
little bit and hang around the middle of

2284
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,800
range

2285
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,600
until it gets some kind of manipulation

2286
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,280
what's going to cause that high impact

2287
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,960
news which is the reason why i started

2288
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,800
you in september looking at the high

2289
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,400
impact and medium impact news events for

2290
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,560
the week

2291
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,480
draw those things together everything

2292
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,320
that you've been exposed to so far for

2293
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,480
the mentorship draw all those things

2294
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,600
together

2295
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,560
and apply the if the data ranges now

2296
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,159
all of you are trying to over complicate

2297
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,400
it and it's probably my fault because of

2298
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,719
the way i taught it and believe me it's

2299
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,880
a lot of things to digest

2300
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,920
it's not simply 60 40 and 20 and

2301
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,400
therefore everything unlocks you have to

2302
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,280
use those ranges looking back and see

2303
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,040
where the highs and lows are where the

2304
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,440
gaps are where the fair value gaps are

2305
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,280
where equilibrium is

2306
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,480
and it'll tell you where the

2307
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,840
institutional reference points are

2308
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,480
it's up to you to execute on them when

2309
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,560
they get to those levels based on what a

2310
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,920
weekly chart and daily chart is

2311
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,480
indicating bullishness for variousness

2312
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,080
just because it goes above an old high

2313
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,360
doesn't mean

2314
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,679
it's a cell it could be

2315
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:26,960
the confirmation is going to go to the

2316
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,840
next buy stop level above it

2317
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,600
that's the next stage of january's

2318
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,199
content where we start building the

2319
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,360
ideas of okay using a monthly and the

2320
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,199
weekly and a daily chart nothing less

2321
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,719
than that

2322
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,040
what do we do what do we look for what's

2323
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,360
the process what sets up the trades on

2324
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,360
these time frames because if we can

2325
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,239
identify and prove that this is what

2326
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,880
goes on in price it does these types of

2327
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,440
things that are repeating phenomenon

2328
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,880
going back to our

2329
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,600
algorithm idea and computer program

2330
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,120
analogy

2331
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,120
if the nose

2332
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,440
simply by going back what's today's date

2333
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,960
everybody knows what today's date is

2334
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,679
it's january 12 2017.

2335
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,760
the computer programmer can can gather

2336
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,480
that information okay so what's 60 days

2337
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,920
from that backwards in time okay then

2338
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,600
the algorithm will simply say okay

2339
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,239
what's the highest value of that asset

2340
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,719
that it traded to okay right there so

2341
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,400
now i need to go back up to that level

2342
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,920
that's what it's going to do it's going

2343
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,000
to go up there to allow

2344
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,040
the bank traders to position themselves

2345
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,440
once it gets close to that level then

2346
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,600
the bank level and broker level

2347
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,520
interventions and manipulations can come

2348
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,360
in but the the broker is not going to

2349
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,800
jump your spread 50 to 100 pips

2350
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,640
the central bank has to get it in close

2351
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,520
proximity to these levels then the lower

2352
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,120
level manipulation that takes place in

2353
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,520
broker level that's when that happens

2354
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,120
but your broker is not killing you and

2355
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,920
wiping you out with 50 pip swings that

2356
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,120
doesn't happen it has to allow price to

2357
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,280
be driven there and that's all central

2358
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,520
bank level

2359
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,840
so i threw a lot at you today children

2360
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,920
uh hopefully uh i haven't confused any

2361
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,239
of you hopefully uh i've given more

2362
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,080
clarity um you're gonna see examples of

2363
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,320
me actually using this information um

2364
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,280
but i have to give it to you

2365
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,760
conceptually first so that way i won't

2366
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,880
be uh

2367
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,120
inundated with a million questions about

2368
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,719
why did you put a line here watch out

2369
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,400
you'll know why i'm doing it because i

2370
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,920
when i explain it

2371
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,840
based on what i've talked about here and

2372
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,520
what i've shown in the

2373
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,679
lesson 101.1

2374
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,000
for january it'll it'll start making

2375
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,520
sense because we're not just going to do

2376
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,280
this one time and never come back to it

2377
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,960
we're going to be doing this throughout

2378
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,040
the mentorship and

2379
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,120
if you

2380
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
i'm not saying you should but when i

2381
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,280
start the signal service in the winter

2382
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,800
of 2017

2383
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,159
um

2384
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,520
you'll know why i'm dealing with certain

2385
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,600
signals then if you if you're able to

2386
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,840
watch it some of you will probably

2387
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,520
want just to see what you know what i'm

2388
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,960
doing just to see how it lines up with

2389
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,280
what you learn but the

2390
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,880
the signals are all going to be based on

2391
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,639
what you're seeing here

2392
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,760
and it's

2393
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,960
why they're going to be so good that's

2394
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,440
why september was so powerful i had to

2395
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,320
show you that yes we can read price it's

2396
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,239
very predictable and if it's that

2397
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,840
predictable on the short term then it

2398
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,199
has to be that predictable in the higher

2399
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,560
time frame

2400
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,280
and you see now that it can be it's all

2401
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,679
time and price

2402
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,199
time

2403
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,320
and price

2404
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,600
time is

2405
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,000
date on the higher time frame it's not

2406
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,080
time of day it's date

2407
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,600
calendar days

2408
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,880
and they're calendar days that the

2409
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,159
markets trade

2410
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,320
so if we know there's a range of 20 40

2411
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,920
and 60 days that the algorithm will look

2412
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,360
back

2413
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,639
then you know what high and loading

2414
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,159
you'd be focusing on

2415
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,639
if market structure is bearish

2416
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,159
what does that tell you where's the loan

2417
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,159
the last 20 days where's the loan last

2418
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,120
40 days where's the loan last 60 days

2419
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,239
that's where it's going to be reaching

2420
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:01,360
for it's looking for that sell side

2421
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,760
liquidity below those lows

2422
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,120
what happens

2423
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,560
if it has

2424
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,360
two

2425
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,840
lower lows that haven't been traded to

2426
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,080
and it trades down below the one

2427
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,679
in the last 20 days it takes that low

2428
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,840
out and as a lower low

2429
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,719
60 days in that range 60 days back

2430
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,320
there's a low and you know that it's

2431
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,360
possibly going to go down there but say

2432
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,199
it doesn't go down there and it rejects

2433
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,960
and it breaks market structure bullish

2434
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,880
what does that tell you

2435
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,840
you have a quarterly shift now it's

2436
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,440
bullish [ __ ] start finding the highs in

2437
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,360
the last 20 days last 40 days and last

2438
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,040
60 days and you'll know what if there's

2439
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,639
dealing it's going to draw a price up to

2440
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:37,920
them everyone else is going to be

2441
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,679
looking at retail thinking okay this is

2442
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:40,960
a trend it's downtrend they're going to

2443
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,199
look for that old low 60 days out not

2444
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,560
because they're doing what we're doing

2445
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,920
but they're going to see classic support

2446
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,560
resistance ideas and they hold on to it

2447
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,560
they marry the idea it's getting going

2448
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,239
down it's been going down so therefore

2449
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,560
it must continuously keep going down and

2450
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,320
they just watch the market grind against

2451
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,520
them and all of a sudden we see what

2452
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,880
we're seeing in the chart right now

2453
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,360
australian dollar what happened

2454
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,280
what happened

2455
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,719
look look at the forums just for fun

2456
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,560
today what happened with an australian

2457
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,679
dollar

2458
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,520
i haven't been there yet i'm just

2459
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,800
prophesying

2460
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,000
they're probably saying what happened

2461
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,080
australian dollar

2462
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,679
well you all know what's happened in the

2463
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,199
australian dollar we talked about this

2464
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,280
before the fact why it's trading here

2465
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,880
why it went there

2466
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,400
and now you know the mechanics behind

2467
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,480
the scene what what led me to believe

2468
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,440
that this 7434 was likely the mean

2469
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,679
threshold was uh um

2470
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,080
upside objective and

2471
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,320
why this currency's a leadership

2472
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,719
currency why'd i focus on this one why

2473
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,159
why was i talking about this one and not

2474
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,800
the new zealand dollar that's a study

2475
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
for you this week as well

2476
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,280
share that with me on

2477
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,679
the forum show me what you discovered by

2478
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,000
contrasting the price action just like

2479
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,639
we just did here for aussie dollar do

2480
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,360
the same thing with new zealand

2481
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,360
do the same thing with euro

2482
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,159
do it with the cable

2483
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,480
you have to practice folks if you only

2484
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,719
do the things i'm only showing you

2485
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,199
you're cheating yourself of all kinds of

2486
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,280
learning opportunity the time that you

2487
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,120
have together

2488
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,199
believe me you want to maximize it i

2489
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,480
know some of you have businesses some of

2490
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,159
you have family obligations and this is

2491
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,000
a long-winded session but

2492
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,199
you know we only have two of them a week

2493
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,440
so suck it up

2494
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,960
the uh

2495
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,719
there's so much information i i

2496
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,600
literally have 20 years of information

2497
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,960
i'm trying to share with you and

2498
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,440
it's a lot of information but this

2499
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,360
information still has to be practiced

2500
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,639
you have to implement it in your charts

2501
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:37,840
you have to look for it you have to see

2502
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,760
it in your charts if you're not going to

2503
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,280
do that

2504
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,159
this is going to be

2505
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,800
it's not going to be enchanting for you

2506
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,760
to be here

2507
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,520
you're if you're wanting me to tell you

2508
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,800
this is how it is and it's always going

2509
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,159
to be this way and it doesn't require

2510
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,679
you to look for it and study it

2511
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,199
ain't going to work it's not going to

2512
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,239
work

2513
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,719
but you do have to do a little bit of

2514
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,639
rolling up your sleeves get your nose in

2515
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,880
the charts but i promise you

2516
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,400
this is a guarantee

2517
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,920
if you do the things i'm telling you to

2518
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,679
do in this teaching and everything in

2519
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,679
this month of january

2520
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:13,280
it will give you every possible scenario

2521
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,120
for any type of trader you want to be

2522
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,960
and it will put you in the high odds

2523
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,480
category you'll be in the upper five

2524
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,280
percent you'll you will most likely be

2525
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,600
on the right side and far less time be

2526
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,280
offside on your trade

2527
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,280
and that's what the higher time frame

2528
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,040
whole idea is about because you're

2529
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,560
trying to align yourself with smart

2530
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,400
money everyone that's on youtube is

2531
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,000
teaching smart money this is the market

2532
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,280
maker i'm on a one-minute chart teaching

2533
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,960
this by by the way they're not on a

2534
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,239
one-minute chart

2535
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,679
they're not even down there they don't

2536
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,280
they don't even they're not looking at

2537
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,080
that

2538
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,320
they're looking at the orders on a daily

2539
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,920
chart that's what they're looking at

2540
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,679
that's what's driving price

2541
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,280
and outside of that

2542
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,719
it's a 15-minute time frame they're

2543
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:52,320
looking for liquidity pools and and

2544
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
ideas around a 15-minute time frame five

2545
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,159
minute again they're not looking at that

2546
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,639
but you can use a five-minute chart

2547
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,520
to find where there's a most likely uh a

2548
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,520
small little gap that would not appear

2549
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,520
readily on a 15 or an hourly chart

2550
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,320
so all these things dovetail nicely

2551
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,679
but you won't appreciate that

2552
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,040
dovetailing

2553
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,960
until you start getting in there and

2554
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,320
spending some time looking at price

2555
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,480
that's already happened

2556
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,719
some of you a large group of you are so

2557
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,639
worried about that right edge tell me

2558
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,080
what that right edge is telling you

2559
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,280
michael

2560
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,360
when that won't make sense to you

2561
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,199
and you'll leave the mentorship

2562
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,679
if i just gave you trades every day yeah

2563
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,960
you'd make money

2564
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,880
but when i'm done teaching and it's and

2565
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,199
that's happening i'm done when i walk

2566
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,239
away

2567
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,679
you've made money but you didn't learn

2568
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,120
how to trade

2569
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,520
and that's a waste of time and money

2570
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,960
you want to be focusing on what's

2571
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,960
happened on that left side of that chart

2572
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,360
because once you understand all that

2573
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,159
it's going to repeat itself

2574
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,679
because if in fact there is a smart

2575
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,760
money entity and they are manipulating

2576
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,199
and they are controlling things because

2577
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,760
they're motivated by money and greed

2578
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,719
they're not going to change their mo

2579
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,080
their motive is going to be the same

2580
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,639
thing going forward it's the same

2581
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,400
business model every single day

2582
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,000
it doesn't change

2583
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
it's not going to stop working

2584
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,520
the only thing is is

2585
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,360
if you share it with people

2586
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,719
number one

2587
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,320
you're just making it common knowledge

2588
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,760
and just you just don't want to do it

2589
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,120
you don't want to do it not because it's

2590
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,400
going to stop working

2591
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,080
but because you just want to be a part

2592
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,480
of that small group that is profitable

2593
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,320
that is an elite that you know what

2594
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,840
you're doing with your money you're not

2595
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,400
gambling this is not

2596
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,920
gambling

2597
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,159
you're not rolling the dice you're

2598
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,320
waiting for a scenario where those

2599
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,480
individuals that control price

2600
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,719
are in play their moving price and

2601
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,639
you're on the same side as them by

2602
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:49,760
default you have no other way except for

2603
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,120
seeing positive

2604
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,560
results

2605
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,040
does that mean profitability maybe

2606
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,080
if you're in a demo account you can't

2607
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,920
make money on that

2608
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,239
but you learn a positive response and

2609
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,159
then therefore it teaches you this

2610
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,400
worked let me try it again

2611
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,480
wow this worked let me try it again why

2612
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,000
do you think i tell you guys that it

2613
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,239
takes a minimum of six months because if

2614
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,480
you look at the things i teach you will

2615
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,520
see at least one market structure shift

2616
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,600
in that time period

2617
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,360
you need to see one because once you

2618
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,120
understand when it happens and you see

2619
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,719
it unfolding

2620
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,120
oh man the confidence level sends you

2621
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,800
through the roof you're like oh man i

2622
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,080
i'm never doing this again i'm never

2623
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,440
working for somebody else again i'm

2624
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,719
going to learn this business and i'm out

2625
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,800
of here i'm done i need to do this the

2626
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,880
rest of my life and your passion level

2627
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,400
will go crazy

2628
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,360
and you'll know what you're doing you

2629
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,639
won't be just excited like a football

2630
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,960
game fan you'll know what you're excited

2631
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,679
about and why it's exciting because it's

2632
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,120
consistent

2633
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,679
it's over and over reoccurring it's

2634
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,000
never deviating it's there all the time

2635
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,679
very rarely do you hear these terms

2636
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:56,000
taught and spoke about in textbooks you

2637
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,960
know

2638
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,719
there's always a risk there's always

2639
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,159
this and it's always that the risk is

2640
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,719
you reading it wrong but this is always

2641
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,159
there in price

2642
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,440
the problem is is that you're going to

2643
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,840
let you as the trader steer you wrong

2644
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,639
because you're going to look at

2645
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:09,600
something you're going to get so

2646
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,320
opinionated about something

2647
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,159
higher time frame it's hard to change

2648
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,320
directions a lot on that daily and

2649
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,760
weekly chart

2650
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,080
it's it's usually one direction for a

2651
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,360
while

2652
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,880
that's why you have to start there

2653
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,159
because if you start on a lower time

2654
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,840
frame you're changing your mind 20 times

2655
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,760
inside of the day and i talked to some

2656
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,280
people outside of our group they're

2657
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,880
still in a free membership area to just

2658
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,800
go on my tutorials and follow my youtube

2659
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,159
channel

2660
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,840
they send me charts all day long i can't

2661
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,600
get to them i can't i can't keep up with

2662
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,000
the emails coming in but they send me

2663
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
their changed mind

2664
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,120
you know here's here's what i'm doing

2665
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,960
today in in cable i'm buying this and

2666
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,400
then okay here's 20 minutes later today

2667
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,480
okay i changed why i'm selling it they

2668
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,760
change their mind again this is all

2669
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,719
happening in two hours

2670
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,400
that's somebody that has no idea what's

2671
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,760
going on

2672
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,639
no idea what's going on by having the

2673
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,800
higher time frame premise by looking at

2674
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,880
monthly weekly and daily charts focusing

2675
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,400
on the daily chart this is what we're

2676
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,560
doing with a daily chart we're framing

2677
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,040
it like a bank does

2678
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,719
no one's teaching you this they don't

2679
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,120
give you the perspective okay from an

2680
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,199
institutional vantage point where how

2681
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,280
and why they're going to go to a

2682
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,280
specific higher level

2683
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,040
yes you can go back in time and look at

2684
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,560
a chart and say okay here's an old logo

2685
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,760
there's going to be sell side liquidity

2686
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,679
here or sell stops here

2687
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,280
all kinds of people on youtube that are

2688
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,560
doing that now

2689
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,080
and yeah it's great

2690
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,480
but i'm telling you which low

2691
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,719
and which high to go to

2692
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,520
there's a specific phenomenon that

2693
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,000
repeats itself over and over and over

2694
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,880
again

2695
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,840
and by having that as your

2696
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,880
routine

2697
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,719
every day you sit down your daily charts

2698
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,159
okay where are we at in the current

2699
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:49,520
range

2700
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,040
where are we at with

2701
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,199
respect to the lowest low and highest

2702
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,280
high in the last 20 days the last 60

2703
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,280
days in the last i'm sorry last 20 40

2704
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,719
and 60 days

2705
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,480
have we cleared both sides of the board

2706
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,560
have we taken all the buy stops

2707
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,400
in the last 60 days in the most highest

2708
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,480
high have we rejected all that and

2709
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,440
cleared out and back in the middle of

2710
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,679
the range because what does that mean

2711
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,360
you have to study are we at a large

2712
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,199
larger longer term equilibrium where we

2713
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,440
could stay sideways for a while or now

2714
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,600
are we going to the sell side

2715
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,280
looking for the lows outside the last 60

2716
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,080
days range

2717
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,159
having that and then start implementing

2718
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,440
inter market analysis

2719
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,639
that means you're going to start having

2720
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,040
ideas from the commodity market

2721
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,440
the equities market

2722
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,560
bonds

2723
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,159
all those things will start giving you

2724
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,080
more information and it'll tell you

2725
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,040
where the opportunities really are

2726
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,120
that way even though we can be

2727
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,600
specific and specialist about i'm a euro

2728
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,560
trader

2729
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,239
i'm like i'm a crude oil trader i'm a

2730
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,600
gold trader

2731
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,400
you do want to have some diversity by

2732
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,400
having some exposure in other asset

2733
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,159
classes because it gives you a great

2734
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,000
deal of context about why you think your

2735
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,440
market's going to go up or down or

2736
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,600
doesn't move at all

2737
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,280
canadian dollar is a

2738
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,760
good example if if the crude oil markets

2739
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,800
um

2740
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,159
you know acting and behaving a certain

2741
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,000
way the canadian dollar is going to have

2742
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,199
a direct uh response to that

2743
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,000
and when crude oil is not of any effect

2744
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,679
in the canadian dollar you know will

2745
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:20,000
move just like the other currencies will

2746
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,520
but crude oil

2747
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,840
has a great deal of influence over that

2748
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,199
particular uh

2749
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,159
currency canadian dollar

2750
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,800
having inter market analysis and

2751
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,120
relative strength analysis

2752
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,800
together

2753
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,120
and implying smt studies like the dollar

2754
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,159
index

2755
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:39,360
and

2756
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,719
the interest rate stuff that i'm

2757
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,199
teaching this month you'll have

2758
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:46,400
very very little opinions

2759
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,679
about what the higher time frames are

2760
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,760
telling you and when you do that

2761
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,520
you are in line with what the

2762
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,440
institutions are doing because you're

2763
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,120
not changing your mind every day this is

2764
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,639
what's going to do i don't care if i see

2765
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,639
two down days on a daily chart nothing's

2766
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,719
changed it just means it's retracing

2767
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:01,920
they're coming back for some more orders

2768
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,120
to buy more

2769
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,800
and that's when we go into discussions

2770
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,280
about building in larger positions with

2771
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,960
an underlying bullish move that's

2772
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,560
already there we've already put in a

2773
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,239
position that's bullish we're retracing

2774
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,080
how do you add more to that where do you

2775
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,360
add more to it and how do you protect

2776
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,800
that position as well

2777
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,920
and and

2778
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,840
what do you do to scale out

2779
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
do we ever hold for whole full positions

2780
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,719
yeah

2781
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:26,159
but you need to know all these things

2782
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,000
you know by the end of this this month

2783
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,840
to fully appreciate what we start

2784
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,920
teaching in february march and april

2785
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,960
because

2786
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,400
they're going to repeat themselves and

2787
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,520
as long as you have a general idea

2788
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,159
of what is being taught in january

2789
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:41,600
i mean if you're completely lost then

2790
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,639
obviously you're gonna need to reach out

2791
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,760
to me after the last lesson in january

2792
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,520
but for the most part if you have a

2793
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,280
general idea what i'm talking about when

2794
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,520
we start applying it every single day we

2795
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,000
sit down you'll see the data points i'm

2796
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,960
looking at

2797
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,280
you'll know exactly why i'm calling this

2798
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,280
high being significant or this low being

2799
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,040
significant or this gap

2800
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,960
you know that that will make perfect

2801
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,239
sense to you then

2802
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,480
what order block am i looking at why why

2803
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,159
this order block and that not that one

2804
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:09,920
michael why'd you pick this swing high

2805
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,400
michael not that swing hi michael

2806
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,360
you just learned it today

2807
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,159
there's a range i'm looking for

2808
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,639
it's 20 days back 40 days back 60 days

2809
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,199
back then i'm casting forward

2810
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,080
and i know from that point on i know i

2811
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,400
can have a nude look back point where i

2812
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,719
can go 20 days 4 days 60 days back and

2813
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,159
wait for those new highs and lows to

2814
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,920
form that have not made its way into

2815
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,159
price yet

2816
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:37,920
when they form liquidity will build

2817
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,320
above it or below it

2818
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,760
based on what i see on the hard time

2819
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,800
frame

2820
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,320
i know what side the market's going to

2821
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,360
reach for

2822
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,440
when you do that same thing you're not

2823
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,280
going to send me emails and text

2824
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,360
messages and direct messages

2825
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,040
do you think the um australian dollar is

2826
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,320
going to go down today

2827
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,080
i i think that the canadian dollar is

2828
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,840
going to go down today what do you think

2829
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,600
don't ask me what i think

2830
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,280
if you're watching my videos and you're

2831
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,520
in here don't ask me what i think the

2832
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,639
whole point is

2833
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,400
learn from what i'm teaching you and you

2834
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,840
arrive at your own opinion and then when

2835
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,520
you're wrong would you what did you do

2836
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,480
wrong

2837
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,239
don't avoid that that's a learning

2838
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,920
opportunity

2839
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,560
take that as a big opportunity center

2840
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,199
stage make me a better trader what can i

2841
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:21,040
do what did i what did i do wrong and

2842
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,719
what did i see wrong there so i don't

2843
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,040
repeat that same thing that's the

2844
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,800
benefit of being in here

2845
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,719
you need to go through the lab

2846
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,520
experience go through the exercise okay

2847
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,440
and make the mistakes now you want to do

2848
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,840
those things right now when it won't

2849
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,000
hurt you it won't hurt your development

2850
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,239
it won't hurt your money it won't take

2851
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,440
anything from you it will build you up

2852
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,679
the folks that have left us they have

2853
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,679
they have no concept of that they don't

2854
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:48,880
want they don't want to wait around they

2855
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,239
don't want to learn anything they want

2856
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,760
to be spoon-fed

2857
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,800
you are here to learn how to do what i

2858
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,000
do

2859
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
analyze the markets call the markets

2860
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,440
from where they are right now and where

2861
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,360
they're going to be at next

2862
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,880
in between those two price points

2863
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,320
there's opportunities and i'm going to

2864
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,440
teach you how to take those

2865
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,280
opportunities and manifest that in the

2866
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,880
form of trades

2867
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,560
keeping risk low

2868
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,960
equity curves going higher and managing

2869
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,960
risk all throughout the whole process

2870
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,760
but you cannot get to that level

2871
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,760
without some interaction on your part

2872
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,920
and it may require you

2873
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,159
to do things by watching videos like

2874
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:25,760
this is a live session

2875
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,520
you may be forced to do these things by

2876
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,360
studying the recordings do not think

2877
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,280
that this is not of any value because

2878
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,760
it's a recording has no it has no basis

2879
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,520
on that had no effect on it

2880
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,280
staying committed

2881
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,600
to the development process is hard it's

2882
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,960
very very hard but i'm trusting that

2883
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,360
what i'm showing you here

2884
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,400
proves number one there is a

2885
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,600
real routine on how why price goes to a

2886
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,880
specific level

2887
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,800
why it repeats why i tell you that it's

2888
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,800
not going to stop working why i tell you

2889
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,480
there's absolutely an algorithm that

2890
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,719
controls price because it does things

2891
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:05,280
that a computer program would naturally

2892
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,560
do

2893
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,760
because i learned to be a computer

2894
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,000
programmer i went to school i have a

2895
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,679
degree in computer science specializing

2896
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,400
in information systems i know computer

2897
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,679
programming

2898
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,840
i know it so if

2899
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,600
i look at this stuff and i wanted to

2900
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,960
become a systems analyst when i was

2901
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,400
going to school that was my job i wanted

2902
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,920
to build the documentation stage so i

2903
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,679
can sit down with the programmers and go

2904
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:28,880
through them and if they had issues with

2905
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
the coding i would help them

2906
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,840
you know make this uh this process work

2907
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,760
but i wasn't going to be the coder i

2908
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,719
don't have the patience to do the coding

2909
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,320
but when i started learning the

2910
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,400
mechanics of what their

2911
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,440
what the

2912
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,000
price delivery does

2913
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,760
i didn't think about it it just jumped

2914
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,040
on my head

2915
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,520
this is the computer program

2916
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,080
this could be automated and by curiosity

2917
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,840
i went home and looked in the charts and

2918
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,360
said okay

2919
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,199
if this is

2920
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,880
possible i should see it in price

2921
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,800
and here you go

2922
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,400
it was right there

2923
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,560
and i got nervous

2924
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,000
and excited at the same time i was

2925
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,199
laughing and crying at the same time

2926
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:12,800
because i thought i literally hit the

2927
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,920
lottery

2928
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,000
like i had the winning lottery numbers

2929
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,960
for the lotto every week going forward i

2930
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,320
had it

2931
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,880
every tumbler clicked it made perfect

2932
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,639
sense i knew right away why i was wrong

2933
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,040
on everything i lost money on

2934
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,600
and i knew now going forward where's the

2935
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,360
next setup going to be

2936
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,280
why do i have to wait for it and when

2937
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,000
will

2938
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,760
what how much time will it take for it

2939
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,119
to happen

2940
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,119
when is it most likely to occur

2941
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,800
where is that signal going to format

2942
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,600
before it even gets to that price level

2943
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,920
that's what this gives you

2944
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,639
it gives you every bit of clarity that

2945
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,639
you don't have right now

2946
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:51,840
once you understand what you're doing

2947
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
with it you'll have every bit of

2948
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,280
understanding about why you're waiting

2949
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,040
and sitting on your hands

2950
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,719
see some of you say oh there's no set up

2951
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,280
right now oh michael i don't hear that

2952
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,719
because i want you to focus on what's

2953
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,679
going on the price has to be

2954
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,440
driven to a specific level then i can

2955
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,520
tell you why this is what happened

2956
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,960
we said it was going up we told you the

2957
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,560
level is going to go up but why did it

2958
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,719
go there you learned that today

2959
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:17,199
going forward you want to be using these

2960
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,560
tools to vapor frame the ideas that lead

2961
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,760
to a trade setup

2962
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,880
as you go through more of the material

2963
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,480
small little pieces will start coming

2964
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,159
clear things that you have questions

2965
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,239
right now you need to not send them to

2966
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:33,920
me in an email

2967
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,480
be surprised by finding the answers in

2968
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,960
the future lessons and in your own study

2969
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,880
that's how you practice that's how you

2970
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,400
develop as a trader

2971
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,560
me giving you an answer

2972
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,239
isn't going to always satisfy because

2973
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:48,000
you're going to still come with 50 more

2974
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,280
questions

2975
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,880
i know that because it's the same thing

2976
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,400
i encountered

2977
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,840
when i think i needed to do something

2978
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
about something and i scoured the

2979
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,000
internet for it it created 50 more

2980
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,040
questions well wait a minute now if i

2981
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,119
came in with one

2982
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,800
one little thing that i was unsure about

2983
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,560
i go in i start looking for it and i get

2984
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,639
the response and the answer to that but

2985
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,119
then it created 20 000 different

2986
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:12,960
scenarios that would create

2987
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,800
a what if scenario well what if this and

2988
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,320
what if that and that's the problem

2989
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,000
every one of you are in that stage and

2990
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,920
it's because you're overzealous and i i

2991
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,000
appreciate that believe me i've been

2992
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,360
there

2993
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,440
but you also have to just take a little

2994
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,880
bit of faith and trust the fact that

2995
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,480
i've taught this before

2996
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,400
you are not a guinea pig scenario i've

2997
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,239
done this with groups of people and

2998
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,320
individual bases as well

2999
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,800
trust me i will get you where you want

3000
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,040
to be at but you have to allow it to

3001
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,040
happen but you also have to be a part of

3002
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,199
it by practicing and looking for it

3003
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,119
not looking for trades

3004
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,480
looking for the things i'm telling you

3005
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,000
the evidence that there is control

3006
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,400
if they evidence control and price that

3007
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,920
means that there's no reason for you not

3008
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,360
to trust the things i'm telling you in

3009
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,880
the future

3010
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,000
if there's something i'm going to teach

3011
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,119
you in the future and i'll say okay

3012
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,440
refer to the if the data ranges this is

3013
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,159
why this turtle soup false break below

3014
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,600
or low is going to happen and we can be

3015
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,520
a buyer down here

3016
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,360
because if i start saying okay look

3017
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,480
we're going to buy

3018
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,600
tomorrow's

3019
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,239
tomorrow we're going to buy today's low

3020
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,400
oh i don't know about that because if we

3021
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,960
sit in london and it starts diving 50

3022
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,119
pips all in one candle

3023
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,960
i guarantee you

3024
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,840
85 or more not buying that day you're

3025
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,360
not buying that low you're going to wait

3026
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,040
for a bullish order block or an optimal

3027
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,159
trade entry or you're going to wait for

3028
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,760
it to move up 60 pips before you think

3029
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,119
it's going to go up

3030
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,040
you won't trust it and you've missed the

3031
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,960
whole learning experience

3032
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,480
you've got to go through the things i'm

3033
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,040
putting you in front of to do those very

3034
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,480
things pay attention what's being done

3035
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,840
right now

3036
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,360
i'm getting a thousand questions about

3037
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,960
why they can't get to october content

3038
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,600

3040
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,360
in november why are you there

3041
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,199

3042
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,520
access to that

3043
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,679

i'm telling you it's a lot of stuff and

3046
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,440
if you are wasting your time on things

3047
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,880
that's already been taught to you and

3048
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,000
it's already in recordings you can go

01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,679
watch it any other time

3050
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,320

01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,719
closely to this one because i guarantee

3052
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:16,080
you if there's any month you're gonna

and believe me it's a lot of stuff and

3103
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,199
you're probably gonna your head's gonna

3104
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:58,560
hurt you're gonna have you're gonna feel

3105
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,159
like man this is information overload

3106
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,239
and i'm already pre-warning you this

3107
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,239
month and i told you this of all the

3108
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:06,080
other months in this mentorship this is

3109
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,199
the one

3110
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:08,639
it's a monster

3111
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,960
it's tons of stuff and you're gonna have

3112
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,840
to study you're going to have to study

3113
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,080
in february we'll resume back to a very

3114
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,159
standardized teaching model eight

3115
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,080
lessons supportive

3116
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,920
in nature and we'll be back to doing

3117
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,360
more live sessions you know throughout

3118
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,520
the week and then in march we'll be

3119
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,360
obviously in live session on a daily

3120
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,199
basis every monday through friday we'll

3121
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,119
be back in live session but you got to

3122
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,280
give me the time to give you this

3123
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,440
information and still operate as the

3124
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,960
mentor and answering emails and also

3125
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,639
running it too i mean there's a lot of

3126
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,719
stuff i have and i have a family

3127
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,880
so permitting me the time to build the

3128
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,719
lessons for you and change some of the

3129
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:49,360
things because i all my notes are all

3130
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,560
based on

3131
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,320
like commodities and

3132
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,159
indices so i have to change some things

3133
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,040
and create some slides that relate to

3134
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,320
foreign exchange because i'm

3135
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,239
predominantly teaching to a crowd that's

3136
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:03,360
come to me by way of fx

3137
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,880
but and when it's um

3138
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,920
it's necessary you'll hear me talk about

3139
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,679
it where um

3140
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,199
this is unique to a specific asset class

3141
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,639
you know like we talked about today with

3142
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,000
commodities the idea of having

3143
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,040
the open interest in your study that is

3144
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,400
only going to come by way of looking at

3145
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,760
the futures market

3146
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,560
so since we're forex traders it it

3147
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,080
is important that you avail yourself

3148
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,000
that information that's available to

3149
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,239
everyone it's common knowledge it's free

3150
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,280
you can go in and get it okay and

3151
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,400
it's valuable it's a gold mine and

3152
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,639
people that think they understand it

3153
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,400
while they may have a little bit a

3154
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,199
myopic view of of what one facet of it

3155
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:48,560
does for you

3156
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,159
what you learned today was the real

3157
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,480
mechanics of what open interest does

3158
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,040
it gives you the x-ray view of what the

3159
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,679
real smart money activity is are they

3160
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,360
really buying because if they're really

3161
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,719
buying they're going to dump open

3162
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,960
interest and it's going to drop 15 or

3163
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,280
more and it's going to happen at a t

3164
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,880
support level

3165
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,239
if it's going to sell off and start

3166
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,679
going lower and if that was a real

3167
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,520
turtle soup cell

3168
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,960
then that means prior to that turtle

3169
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,239
soup cell they should have been a

3170
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,880
massive increase over time with that

3171
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,560
open interest going up and you saw that

3172
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,560
in australian dollar

3173
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,080
because open interest

3174
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,719
high open interest indicates

3175
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:27,760
them offering the sell side

3176
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,280
they're only going to take part of that

3177
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,400
if they know eventually they're going to

3178
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,880
be able to sell that position off with

3179
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,119
price being going lower

3180
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:36,639
that's the only time open interest is

3181
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:37,920
going to go up and they can do this on

3182
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,520
long term trends

3183
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,600
but it will shift every quarter they

3184
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,239
have to fund themselves for allowing the

3185
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,639
holding of that risk

3186
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,400
now you're probably thinking okay well

3187
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,920
michael if they're in control of price

3188
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,639
what real what real risk is there

3189
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:53,679
well

3190
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:55,840
what happens when a rogue nation nukes

3191
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,600
another nation

3192
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,280
you're not thinking that are you but

3193
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,639
that can happen

3194
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:01,920
what would that do

3195
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,520
what would that do if a nuclear bomb

3196
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,760
gets dropped in any nation it's going to

3197
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
freak everybody out uh oh we're in world

3198
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,639
war iii bombs are dropping

3199
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,960
when september 11th happened

3200
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,400
boom markets are all over the place

3201
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,080
anything can happen look at the brexit

3202
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,159
look at donald trump

3203
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,600
look what that did

3204
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,320
there's risk okay but they take these

3205
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,880
risky and uh opportunities and they

3206
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,280
manipulate but they don't want to hold

3207
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,000
on to something and not make money

3208
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,239
so yeah why they will provide liquidity

3209
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:37,119
and sell to the buyers that see price

3210
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,440
trade higher for a period of time

3211
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,960
every three months look at your charts

3212
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,080
and see if they don't reset themselves

3213
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,040
every three months it's there

3214
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,440
it happens in s p

3215
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,440
it happens in stocks it happens in

3216
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,320
commodities it happens in bonds it

3217
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,080
happens in forex it's there every three

3218
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,360
to four months you'll see it it's there

3219
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,840
and that's how they pay themselves

3220
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,920
for holding on that risk offering the

3221
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,600
liquidity for the sell side of it

3222
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,520
providing the means for buyers to buy

3223
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,960
currency

3224
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,239
they will do

3225
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,840
what we're discussing here quarterly

3226
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,960
shifts

3227
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,800
and you'll see evidence is that in open

3228
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,960
interest

3229
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,280
it will happen at points at which by

3230
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,679
looking back 20 40 and 60 days where

3231
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:25,119
those highs and lows are where those

3232
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:28,000
gaps are where equilibrium is those

3233
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,199
reference points in that time field okay

3234
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:33,920
of 60 days is the maximum look back

3235
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,679
it's simple and here's another study to

3236
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:37,760
make it easy for you

3237
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,840
just go back 60 days from every month

3238
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:40,880
beginning

3239
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,800
start every month it was an exercise

3240
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,119
every single month a calendar month

3241
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:48,239
put put a vertical line on at every new

3242
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,320
month

3243
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,800
go back 60 days find the highest high

3244
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,320
and lowest low and you see if they don't

3245
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,199
wipe that out you can take any pair

3246
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,280
you can be the dollar index it could be

3247
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,159
the

3248
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,159
well look at the australian dollar

3249
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,880
put a vertical line on every single

3250
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,040
first trading day of every month

3251
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:07,920
okay

3252
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,280
don't do them all at one time so that

3253
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,440
way your charts nice and crisp and clean

3254
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,199
but put a vertical line at the beginning

3255
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:14,960
of every month the first trading day of

3256
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,320
every month okay and draw out a line

3257
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:22,800
okay 60 days 60 trading days okay and

3258
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,880
delineate that and then find the highest

3259
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,480
high and the lowest low and then go

3260
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,320
forward from the from to the right of

3261
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,560
that and you see if they don't run those

3262
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,960
uh buy stops and sell stops above above

3263
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,920
that and do the same thing for 40 days

3264
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,159
and do the same thing for 20 days

3265
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,080
doing that study

3266
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,400
that's exactly what i did the night that

3267
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,639
i've seen how this works

3268
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,080
that's all i did

3269
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,440
i said okay

3270
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,440
if i'm a data if i'm a computer

3271
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,719
programmer i need to be able to

3272
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,440
reference something how can they know

3273
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,199
what the orders are

3274
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:57,119
like how because in my mind how could

3275
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:58,239
they see

3276
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:00,719
lynne waldock's orders

3277
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,320
because that's how i looked at it my my

3278
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,080
perspective was

3279
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,320
if what i'm learning

3280
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,480
to do in the marketplace

3281
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,280
to be a market maker i have to know

3282
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,560
certain things

3283
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,119
and what i was learning

3284
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:16,800
if this is true

3285
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,400
then i should see evidences of it in

3286
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,840
price

3287
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,520
and i couldn't wait to get home

3288
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,679
i went home pulled out my charts and it

3289
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:25,360
was a swiss franc chart

3290
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,960
that was that was the actual chart i

3291
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,080
opened up my

3292
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,800
commodity price charts from

3293
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,360
commodity trend service and i literally

3294
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,560
turned the page and i literally

3295
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,880
in seconds seen it

3296
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,880
i said okay if i'm if i'm the computer

3297
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,560
program and i'm going to be able to

3298
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,440
reach up into aerial orders it can't i

3299
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,280
can't know what every brokerage firm's

3300
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,880
orders are

3301
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,360
there's no way it's dynamic

3302
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,719
think about it

3303
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,400
you might have a trade on right now and

3304
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,920
you might have a stop on

3305
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,560
it may be there but something might

3306
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,719
change and you collapse that trade

3307
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,920
your order's not there anymore

3308
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,400
every one of us are dynamic thinking

3309
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,840
we may have an order there think about

3310
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,280
what you did with your last trade how

3311
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,159
many times did you meet your stop-loss

3312
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,239
think about it you were long you you

3313
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:17,599
moved your chair you shared your

3314
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:19,280
stop-loss up okay and then you started

3315
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,320
seeing a little retracement you're like

3316
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,560
oh let me move that back and some of you

3317
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,599
probably moved back further than it

3318
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,400
first originated at you're dynamic so

3319
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,320
your orders are always moving around and

3320
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,080
that's why i say hey this is too much of

3321
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,280
a variable

3322
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,199
there's no way for them

3323
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:36,320
to know every single book that's out

3324
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,520
there

3325
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,719
so how can you standardize it

3326
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:43,520
the epiphany i had was

3327
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,080
go back and go back to the same number

3328
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,840
of days that i'm being taught to look

3329
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,880
for

3330
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,760
and just look for the high and low

3331
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,880
that's where the buy stops are and

3332
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,639
that's where the cell stops are

3333
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,239
and there it was

3334
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:57,360
it was like

3335
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,760
solomon's mind just opened up all the

3336
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,840
fort knox opened up everything happened

3337
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,960
that moment a flood of emotions flood of

3338
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,639
euphoria and fear like oh no did i just

3339
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,159
do something i wasn't supposed to do did

3340
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:11,679
i just learn something and see something

3341
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,880
i wasn't supposed to that's how i felt

3342
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,280
i had this big old textbook okay of

3343
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,119
information i had to digest and i

3344
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:20,239
literally didn't want to touch it

3345
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,320
anymore because in my mind i had already

3346
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,679
cracked it

3347
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:25,280
i didn't want to go back

3348
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,119
i did not want to sit with these people

3349
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:29,119
and learn anything more than i had

3350
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:31,920
already learned there

3351
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,280
i went from that to the corn market in

3352
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,639
commodities

3353
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:39,119
it was there

3354
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:42,400
soybeans live cattle pork bellies they

3355
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,760
don't trade anymore

3356
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,960
a silver

3357
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,800
all the metals palladium platinum high

3358
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,159
grade copper

3359
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,199
cotton

3360
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:50,880
lumber

3361
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,159
orange juice

3362
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:54,800
it's all there

3363
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,520
it's all there

3364
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,599
once you see it you're never going to

3365
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:04,239
forget it and you can't unsee it and

3366
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:06,320
when you see these things that repeat

3367
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,560
over and over again and they are they're

3368
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:09,840
finite

3369
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,760
you'll prove it to yourself in a in the

3370
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,239
short little exercise like that

3371
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,000
pull up a chart i don't care what asset

3372
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,239
class it is define it look back the last

3373
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:19,679
20 days last four days in the last 60

3374
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:20,639
days where's the high and low where's

3375
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,400
the liquidity voids where's the

3376
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,080
fair value gaps and where's equilibrium

3377
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,599
and you'll know exactly what price is

3378
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:26,800
going to do on that right hand side of

3379
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,480
your chart

3380
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,800
it's going to move to those levels

3381
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,080
now think in terms of overbought and

3382
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,920
oversold

3383
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,599
you will be able to define a range by

3384
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,719
doing that

3385
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:37,920
you don't need an indicator to tell you

3386
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,080
if your overbought oversold look at the

3387
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,000
highest level of liquidity

3388
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,840
in the form of a high in the last 60

3389
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,000
days and the lowest low last 60 days

3390
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,119
that's your real overbought never sold

3391
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:50,239
you don't need to you don't need an

3392
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:52,239
indicator for that i've made fun of that

3393
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:54,080
stuff in my free tutorials and on

3394
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,520
youtube you know these guys talking

3395
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,480
about diversity i don't need a

3396
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,000
divergence i need to know where's the

3397
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,080
range where am i in terms of

3398
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:01,920
institutional overflow the real

3399
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,280
institutional overflow the what i'm

3400
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,679
talking about you don't hear this talk

3401
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,760
chris lori is not teaching this stuff

3402
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,159
okay online trading isn't teaching it

3403
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,520
youtube guys on there they're not

3404
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,880
teaching this

3405
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,520
these are finite things unless you came

3406
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,199
from where i came from you're not seeing

3407
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:18,639
or learning or even knowing about this

3408
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:20,880
stuff

3409
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:24,560
it gets deeper than this

3410
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,840
it gets more specific than

3411
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,159
this this was just the beginning stages

3412
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,000
of what i i'm taking you whether you

3413
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,320
realize i'm taking you through the whole

3414
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,599
process of how i became ict

3415
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:39,840
the things i learned the way i learned

3416
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,280
it the the process of how i got to it

3417
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,679
it's what you're seeing here

3418
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:47,280
one stage at a time

3419
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,560
and how do i know it's like this because

3420
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,199
i journal i've kept a journal for years

3421
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:53,199
and i remember certain things because i

3422
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:54,400
journal

3423
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,920
i go back in time and look at certain

3424
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,119
things i get to relive that moment

3425
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,880
that's why i'm so passionate about

3426
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,480
teaching you

3427
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,400
even before i started charging

3428
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,639
look how passionate i've always been

3429
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:06,239
i've always been passionate because i

3430
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,000
know what it was like for me to

3431
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,320
experience it to go through the process

3432
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,520
in that euphoric moment when i finally

3433
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,159

01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,760
to be oh you're going to be all over the

3464
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,639
place you're going to be throwing up

3465
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:20,320
char son sunday look at this it did it

3466
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,040
here it did it here this is it then then

3467
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,719
you are not gonna be able to sleep it's

3468
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,719
gonna be like no doze forget about it

3469
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:28,000
caffeine you won't need it you're gonna

3470
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,840
be jumping around hopped up on goofballs

3471
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,840
because you literally won't be able to

3472
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,679
contain yourself because you know

3473
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:35,360
exactly what you're looking for going

3474
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,320
forward

3475
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:39,199
that's exactly what traders want

3476
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:40,960
you're asking for setups give me signals

3477
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,199
no that's not what you want really break

3478
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:46,639
it down you want to know what i know

3479
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,880
you want to know when you are going to

3480
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,400
take a trade because think about that's

3481
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,080
ultimate control because if you know

3482
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,480
where to find the next 20 30 50 60

3483
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,080
trading opportunities

3484
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:59,199
you don't have to trade today do you

3485
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:00,480
contrast it to what you felt like this

3486
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,400
morning before the session opened up

3487
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,599
you're hoping i'll give you something

3488
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:04,880
right now because you want to take a

3489
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,239
trade

3490
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:08,000
and it only comes because you don't know

3491
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,599
anything right now

3492
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,560
you don't know what you want to do

3493
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:15,280
you want to focus on the common goal is

3494
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,280
that this information is going to take

3495
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,599
you to the understanding of knowing what

3496
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,920
it is that you are going to do and when

3497
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,880
you don't want to do it

3498
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,800
to stop distracting yourself by going

3499
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,800
through old content

3500
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,400
don't even watch my free tutorials this

3501
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,400
month just focus on this because believe

3502
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:36,000
me it's a lot it's a lot of stuff

3503
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,920
then and only then

3504
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,159
start amplifying it you know by doing

3505
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:41,360
the other stuff and the new things that

3506
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,040
we teach in february going forward but

3507
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,400
there's a lot of things that you need to

3508
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,639
be paying attention to for this month if

3509
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,400
you miss this

3510
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:50,159
you're going to struggle the rest of the

3511
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:51,520
mentorship

3512
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,880
and i mean that

3513
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:55,360
and if you don't stay it's because you

3514
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:58,400
didn't take my words to heart right now

3515
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,920
because you don't you're not you're not

3516
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,199
trying to do it and guess what there's

3517
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:02,719
no shame in that because if you don't

3518
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:05,040
want to do the work what's required here

3519
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,080
you're not going to make it in trading

3520
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,520
regardless if we had everything i was

3521
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,199
going to teach in this whole entire

3522
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:10,400
mentorship

3523
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,760
it's all between your ears it's going to

3524
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,280
be the problem

3525
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,119
so this is the dividing marker for many

3526
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,520
of you if you can't submit to what's

3527
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,520
required and that you have to do in

3528
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,639
january

3529
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,320
you might just hang it up

3530
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,920
just you know forget about it don't

3531
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,840
worry about it and you know go back to

3532
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,280
watching free tutorials and youtube

3533
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:30,320
videos and and then be content with that

3534
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,000
and don't let it beat you up because you

3535
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,480
have now arrived at that's the final

3536
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,159
decision maker because if you're not

3537
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,360
going to be organized if you're not

3538
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,440
going to be disciplined to do the work

3539
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,440
that's necessary you're never going to

3540
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:42,800
trade

3541
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,400
not in fine profitability it won't

3542
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,239
happen it's not going to happen

3543
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,280
you want

3544
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
reality you want truth that's what this

3545
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,480
is

3546
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,840
you won't make money at all unless you

3547
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,679
submit and do the things i'm gonna teach

3548
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:57,679
you in january

3549
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:59,040
everything

3550
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,440
if you don't do these things

3551
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,239
with one thousand percent of surety

3552
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:05,840
you're wasting your time with me you're

3553
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,679
wasting your money with me and you're

3554
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:09,280
never going to be profitable with the

3555
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:10,719
things that i teach it's not going to

3556
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:12,320
happen you'll have hit and miss results

3557
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,599
and you're going to undo everything

3558
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,199
because you're going to just go nuts

3559
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:16,480
you're going to just over trade trying

3560
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,000
to get it all back and you don't need to

3561
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,159
do any of those types of things

3562
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:22,480
you can be very boring about it

3563
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,679
and that's what you want you want to be

3564
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,520
boring you want you want that same

3565
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,360
feeling when you go to work

3566
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,440
it's the same thing every day

3567
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,199
same people every day that's what you

3568
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:33,599
want your trading to be same thing i

3569
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,840
know in 60 days looking back that's

3570
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:38,239
where i need to be focusing on

3571
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:39,760
last 40 days where that's what i need to

3572
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,440
be focusing on last 20 days that's what

3573
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,960
i need to be focusing on take that

3574
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,760
information cast it forward

3575
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,599
those levels cast it forward they're

3576
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,119
going to be influential in the future

3577
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:51,199
and there's going to be new levels that

3578
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:54,000
create highers and lows 20 days going

3579
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:54,880
forward

3580
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,639
40 days going forward 60 days going

3581
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,080
forward

3582
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:01,440
and by doing that you get a future level

3583
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,679
to draw a vertical line on

3584
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,840
and look back 20 40 and 60 days and if

3585
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,800
you get an overlap

3586
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,800
that's when the magic happens

3587
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,000
and with that kids i'm going to close it

3588
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
wish you a very good day and i will have

3589
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
the recording up as soon as i'm humanly

3590
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,840
possible can

3591
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,360
i guess i do have to do another session

3592
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,960
so this one might have to go on a little

3593
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,960
bit later because i do want to do a live

3594
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,920
recap another live recap but a recap of

3595
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,679
today's price action and then i'll have

3596
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:29,599
this one up afterwards so uh because it

3597
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:30,880
takes a little bit more time for this

3598
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,560
longer ones to compress

3599
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:33,760
and

3600
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:35,199
hopefully you guys found it insightful

3601
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:36,320
i'm going to

3602
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,080
wish you all a very good day

3603
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:41,800
and good luck and good trading
