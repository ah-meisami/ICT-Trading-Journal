00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome back folks this is lesson 1.5

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
defining institutional swing points

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
okay we're going to be talking about

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
institutional swing points now

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
you've heard me teach

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
in many instances where the

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
swing high swing low forms in the price

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
action swing high being a high with a

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
lower high to the left of it and a lower

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
high to the right of it just a three

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
consecutive three candle or three bar

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
pattern

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
one with a high with

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,879
two lower highs to the

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,399
either side of it

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,680
and then obviously the same thing would

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,960
be said just in opposite terms for a

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
swing low one candle with a higher

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
candle to the left of it and a higher

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
candle to the right of it

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,719
that's a swing low that's what i learned

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,160
from my mentor larry williams pretty

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,079
simple easy pattern

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
there's been a lot of patterns i've come

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
across through my development as a

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
trader some of them

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
rather elaborate they really didn't mean

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
too much in terms of future

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,400
prognostication but nonetheless they

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
were fun to read about initially got my

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,080
hopes up but didn't really deliver

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
anything

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
i'm not talking about swing points in

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,560
that

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
degree here

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
i want you to think about institutional

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,840
swing points

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
in terms of

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
concept in other words what's going on

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
behind the scenes i don't want to draw

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
any charts up i don't want to pull any

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
examples up i want you to think about it

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
conceptually because we're going to be

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
building on these ideas

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
i want you to understand that there's

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
really only two forms of

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
swing points in the marketplace as it

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
relates to institutional trading

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
it's in the form of a stop run or a

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,399
failure swing

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
that's it there's nothing else

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,280
so we're going to talk about the two

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
forms of swing points and we're going to

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
talk about the contrasting differences

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
between

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,439
the two and what makes them

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,600
opportunities for us as traders and how

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
we can see the characteristics of both

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
the first one we're looking at here

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,239
is

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,239
essentially the breaker

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,879
okay this is a breaker where the market

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
will generally make a higher high

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,800
fail then break down and have a

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
rejection at the highs

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,760
many times this is a very surprising and

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
deflating pattern for some traders and

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
everyone's experienced at some time in

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
their development where they've bought

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
a specific price point with the

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
expectation it's going to go higher

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
initially does and then once it makes

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
that new higher high it breaks lower

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
aggressively and you probably experience

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
it as well where you market you sell a

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,200
low

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
and it starts to break lower you feel

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
good about the trade now sudden just by

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
moving below a previous low a little bit

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
explodes on the upside and now you're

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
trapped or stopped out

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
this pattern in my opinion is the most

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
powerful the most dynamic the most

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
significant price pattern you need to

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
learn conceptually

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
and you understand some of the

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
characteristics about where it forms

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
but

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
what generally happens is

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
when you have a selling

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,280
scenario the market will generally make

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
a rally up

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
to an area of old resistance now that

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
resistance can come in the form of how

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
we interpret resistance as a bare

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
shoulder block it could be a breaker

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
or mitigation block

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
it could be an old low it's returning to

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
or it could be you know high it's

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,319
returning to

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,120
and it may fall short just by a few pips

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,599
or points initially and start to trade

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,640
lower

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
and retail traders and like myself when

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
i first started i thought that this was

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
most likely going to be when the market

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,159
would break down aggressively and start

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
trading lower and i could be

109
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,599
expecting lower prices well

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
the market makes one more pass higher

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
driving out that short term high it

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
creates and it spooks the marketplace

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
and it upsets those traders that are

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,200
already short

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
and ultimately goes to the level at

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
which you would have expected it to

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
trade to the first time which is that a

118
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
resistance level or in this case it

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
could be a bearish order block for us or

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
could close in a gap

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
but when we see price hovering just

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
below a key institutional reference

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
point like we learned in september which

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
are the bearish order blocks bullshore

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
blocks liquidity voids fair value gaps

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
when we see these things in our charts

127
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,639
we anticipate price trading to them

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
to the pip or

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,720
into them a little bit like as it were

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
for a order block

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,639
the

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
the idea is once you see

133
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
the level and these levels are going to

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
be delineated with the blue lines

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
uh the diagram on the left represents a

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
selling opportunity or where we expect

137
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
some measure of resistance

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
that could be a bearish order block uh

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
the short-term high that forms prior to

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
that

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
higher high

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
that's what gets many traders caught

143
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,039
and if you understand order blocks

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
many times the bearish order block is

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,120
just above that it didn't it didn't

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
trade to it or it leaves a little bit of

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
a fair value gap

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
and price comes up and just falls short

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
of filling it in

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
and then finally drives up and closes

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
that little bit of a range in that's

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
when you get this

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
breaker

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
swing point

155
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
now why is it a breaker

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
the fact that it creates that little

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
short term low in between the higher

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
high and the previous high

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
for the sell side diagram on the left

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
when the market breaks down and takes

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
out that short term low

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
prior to the new high

163
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,639
that is indicating that the market has

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
broke

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
those individuals that were initially

166
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
short

167
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
and now they're trapped

168
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
so when that move takes place what

169
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,000
you're seeing is

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
the opportunity for the marketplace to

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
move aggressively away from the level

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
it was an initial fake out

173
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,479
and then the buy stop sometimes also are

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,919
what's targeted so it could be a order

175
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,840
block it could be a

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
fair value gap it could be a liquidity

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
void getting closed in it didn't get

178
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
closed the initial time and then

179
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,319
searched up the second leg up

180
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
many instances

181
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
by looking at your charts you'll have a

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
plethora of examples and

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
gaining experience by looking at

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
hindsight examples of how that occurs

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
the one of the benefits of looking at

186
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,960
intraday charts not that we're going to

187
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,039
be talking about intraday in this

188
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,280
month but when we practice with intraday

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
charts it gives us a lot of

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
examples of where these types of events

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
take place because this very pattern

192
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,039
here

193
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,680
this materializes every single day it

194
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
materializes every single day and in

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
every single pair it's there you have to

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
study every single time frame and see

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,400
how this pattern manifests itself

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
when the bias of being bullish

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
the market diagram here that we have on

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
the right hand side where the cell stops

201
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
are ran out below a short-term low once

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
it hits the level or short falls short

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
of a support level the market many times

204
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
will drive lower and go right into that

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
level

206
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,880
to me i love this pattern because number

207
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,599
one i can see when it's forming okay i

208
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
can see when it's just falling short of

209
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
a level and where we're going to

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
anticipate one more drive lower or in

211
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
this case it could be a drive higher on

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,160
the bullish side but when we look at

213
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
price

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
it's important to have the key levels or

215
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
the institutional reference points that

216
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
we taught in september

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
those ideas

218
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,319
have to already be on your chart if you

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,080
don't see them

220
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
already outlined

221
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,039
you're not going to be able to

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
capitalize on the opportunities that

223
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
these patterns present themselves with

224
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
so if we see cell stops being ran out or

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
if we see a fair value gap below the

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
marketplace or a liquidity void that

227
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,199
didn't initially fill in the first pass

228
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
lower and then dries lower then closes

229
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,080
it in

230
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
all those

231
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
scenarios can lend well to this pattern

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
by itself

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
conceptually it doesn't do you any good

234
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,879
just hearing me talk about it so you

235
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
have to go into the charts and literally

236
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,360
pull out examples where a short-term

237
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
high was passed through just a little

238
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
short period time right after that and

239
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
then it creates that re rejection or

240
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
reversal high

241
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,200
same thing is said for the

242
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
buy side of the uh the breaker pattern

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
these swing points if you look at them

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,399
they many times offer

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
outstanding entry points what makes them

246
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
scary is the fact that

247
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
the number one question i get about them

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,640
is how do you know

249
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,279
if you're going to see it reverse if you

250
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
sell above the previous high

251
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
and that comes by experience with

252
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
trusting the institutional reference

253
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
points that we taught in september and

254
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
throughout all the free tutorials order

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
blocks

256
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
breakers mitigation blocks liquidity

257
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,519
voids and now you've learned

258
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,279
fair value gaps

259
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
so

260
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
having these ideas in your chart you'll

261
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
be able to anticipate

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
these patterns unfolding before they

263
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
actually do

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
if you don't have the levels on your

265
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,959
chart

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,320
you're going to be surprised by these

267
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
things but that's okay i already know

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
that most of you aren't going to be able

269
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,000
to see this pattern readily before that

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,040
happens so what can you do with it once

271
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
you see the pattern break down

272
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
in the example on the left-hand side for

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
our

274
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
bearish swing point in the form of a

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
bearish breaker

276
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
when that high is broken and it takes

277
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
out that short-term loan between

278
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
that market structure shift breaking

279
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
point

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,880
that becomes your trigger

281
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
if price ever comes back up to that

282
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,080
level you can be a seller

283
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,480
now the beautiful thing is

284
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,120
we already have a stop run

285
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
on this pattern

286
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
now think institutionally

287
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
there was a short-term high

288
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
right here

289
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,600
the market comes down creates a

290
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
short-term low and it rallies up taking

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
out this short-term high

292
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
blowing out the buy stops closing in a

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
liquidity void that didn't get filled in

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
completely when this first pass came up

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
or it came into a bearish order block

296
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
maybe it fell short of the various order

297
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
block here or maybe this is just a

298
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
simply an old

299
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,959
high

300
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
and price comes right back above the old

301
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
high and then rejects and trades lower

302
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,720
you don't have to fear this pattern here

303
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
if you can't if you don't have the

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
confidence to get in here and sell that

305
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
idea

306
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,399
like an institutional trader would go

307
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,920
right in there and sell it rate as it

308
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
trades through it

309
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
wait for it to break down if it takes

310
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
out that short term low when market

311
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
trades back up to that trigger point

312
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,519
right here

313
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,880
that's when you would be looking to be a

314
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
seller

315
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
the wonderful thing again is about this

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
pattern is we already have the stop run

317
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,720
so if it's already

318
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
stopped out those individuals here

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
there's no reason for it to want to come

320
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
back up and trade back in there because

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,160
these traders are already knocked out

322
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
so we can be a seller here with a great

323
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,440
deal of confidence that our stop loss

324
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,800
could actually be

325
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
above this high

326
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
or rate at that high the likelihood of

327
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
coming back up there after an aggressive

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
breakdown

329
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
once a level has already been arrived at

330
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
discerning that there has been an

331
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
expectation of the market being bearish

332
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
if we see evidence is that we've already

333
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
seen a stop run here

334
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
if we've seen a move start to break

335
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,160
lower at or just below that that

336
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
resistance level

337
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
this is going to lull traders into

338
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
believing and let you know what it feels

339
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
like as well you want to see price

340
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,079
action moving in your favor many times

341
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,640
as a new trader so this dropping off

342
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,959
will get traders short where's their buy

343
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,079
stock going to be placed right above

344
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,320
this high so this pass through clears

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
out that buy side liquidity that they

346
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
can engineer new shorts on

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
so when we see it return back up to this

348
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
level here it gives a great deal of

349
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
confidence even on a daily time frame

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
that we're most likely not going to see

351
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
price trade back up to this level here

352
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
because it's already done its job of

353
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,839
knocking out those players that are

354
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
already short they don't want to give

355
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,200
them an opportunity to get a good price

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
in a short they've already done that

357
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,639
themselves by knocking out the initial

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,399
bears

359
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,320
this breaking point here we want to be

360
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,200
selling at that point right there

361
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
so when we look at price we're looking

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
for this pattern for ourselves

363
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
this is the highest most probable

364
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
condition to be a short seller in the

365
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
marketplace because it has a built-in

366
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
advantage even though it's the most

367
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
fearful thing for you right now you

368
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
don't want to sell above an old high

369
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
because you haven't practiced enough you

370
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
haven't seen the effects of looking at

371
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
institutional order flow on a higher

372
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
time frame or any other time frame for

373
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
that matter that frames the support

374
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
ideas around these particular

375
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
reads on stops

376
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,000
the same thing is said just in opposite

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
terms for when you're looking to be a

378
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,839
buyer you want to see a short term low

379
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
form at or just above a key support

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,480
level it could be a bullish order block

381
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
it could be a liquidity void that hadn't

382
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
filled in on this pass here that does

383
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
here

384
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
it could be an old load it just simply

385
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
runs down below

386
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
if it's an old low there is no limit to

387
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
time between this low and the new load

388
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
it forms

389
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
okay and that re in that regards there's

390
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
no there's no time limit like you can

391
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
look at an old low here and it could be

392
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
six months and then finally it trades

393
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
down below that low and then it runs

394
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
that's still the same pattern here okay

395
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
ideally you want to see something that

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
has just recently created a low came

397
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
back a little bit a few days maybe a

398
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
week and then it dries one more time

399
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
through it and hits your bullish

400
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
institutional reference point it could

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
be again

402
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,639
trading down to an old high or it could

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
be a lower low it trades down but the

404
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
main thing is you want to see a low

405
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,839
that makes no real sense stopping there

406
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,160
and giving a little tiny little bounce

407
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
and then expect that drive lower closing

408
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,120
in on that real level you're having on

409
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
your chart which constitutes support

410
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
just like we mentioned over here the

411
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
opposites said here

412
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,440
any buyers over here on this little pop

413
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
is going to have their protective cell

414
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
stop just below that low

415
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
we want to think institutionally about

416
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
accumulating those sell stops

417
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
so if they're going to sell it to us

418
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
we're going to be a buyer and we're

419
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
going to be buying a deep discount with

420
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
the expectation now here's the thing you

421
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
want to see an immediate response away

422
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
from that level you don't want to see it

423
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
trade down below this low

424
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
and hang around for a while okay you

425
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
don't want to see that

426
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
the problem you're going to encounter is

427
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,279
because we're trading on a daily time

428
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
frame as position traders we're gonna

429
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
have to wait a long time sometimes

430
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,320
for

431
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,639
that confirmation it may it may require

432
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
the whole entire daily range before the

433
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,079
daily candle creates the wick

434
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
here so this many times will become the

435
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,199
wick

436
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
the market will trade down

437
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,360
make that low here and then wick away

438
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
from that low and then you'll see what

439
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,199
many people get excited about as a

440
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
hammer or

441
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
some kind of a doji okay and i'm not

442
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
teaching classical if you want to call

443
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,360
it that candlestick patterns but the

444
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
idea is

445
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
candlestick traders trade the

446
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,000
candlesticks that have formed

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,720
institutional traders we trade it when

448
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
it's a bold face candle before it

449
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
becomes that that wick or that hammer or

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,079
doji

451
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,360
it takes a great deal of confidence to

452
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,160
be buying down here below an old low

453
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
whereas retail traders they all have

454
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
reasons to justify why something should

455
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,160
be done after some form of confirmation

456
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,920
if you're demanding confirmation you're

457
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
not going to get this entry down here

458
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,279
but you can get a favorable entry point

459
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
by waiting for a market structure shift

460
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,920
here

461
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
so when the market structure shifts on

462
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,519
the bullish side here all eyes go back

463
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,360
to this reference point here

464
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
we're not worried about coming back down

465
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
here again we don't care about that

466
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
we're worried just simply for a return

467
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,160
to this level here

468
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
so again the same mindset we said about

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,639
the sell side or bearish breaker on

470
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
swing point

471
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
this

472
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
we know this has already been arrayed on

473
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,839
cell stops

474
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,240
there's no expectation or reason to

475
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
believe that the market needs to come

476
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
back down into this level again because

477
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
it's already done its work it's cleared

478
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,040
out the sell stops and the market is

479
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
quickly rejected

480
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
the market if it does give you an

481
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
opportunity to come back down into

482
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,720
this

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
breaking point

484
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,720
we can be a buyer here

485
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
with the exception

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,040
that there may be a bullish order block

487
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
over here it doesn't have to come back

488
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
down to this level just like it doesn't

489
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,679
have to come all the way back up to this

490
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,199
level it could just come right back up

491
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
to an area over here where there would

492
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
be another order block to trade off of

493
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
depending on how aggressive

494
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
the selling was away from this high or

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,679
where the buying was in terms of

496
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,000
magnitude you may never get that return

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,359
back down to this price point it may

498
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
just keep on screaming higher and that's

499
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,400
sometimes going to happen and that's

500
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
going to be a missed opportunity but i

501
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
want you to think about the marketplace

502
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
in two

503
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
conceptual ways as it relates to swing

504
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,400
points

505
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
you have a breaker swing point

506
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
which is what we're describing here and

507
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
i'm giving you the classification of it

508
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
and i'm teaching this one first because

509
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
this is the one i trade predominantly

510
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
because it's based around

511
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,320
the pattern i like to trade which is the

512
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
turtle suit

513
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
a false break above an old high

514
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,400
rejection and quickly it moves away and

515
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
if i don't get the entry off like i want

516
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,280
to

517
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
it i always give it an opportunity to

518
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,520
get back in here so it's like a

519
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
two-chance setup

520
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
and many times you don't get two second

521
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
chances in trading you know you either

522
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,840
miss it and you never get it again or

523
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
you take it you lose money and here

524
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,120
this pattern is in my opinion the best

525
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,200
pattern in in market structure when

526
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,799
you're looking for uh

527
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,679
institutional evidences to what should

528
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
be taking place in price when you see

529
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,919
this pattern unfold and you learn to

530
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
anticipate it you're going to have the

531
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
highest probable entries for all your

532
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
setups because you're actually entering

533
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,039
at the lowest possible point for buys

534
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,240
and you're selling at the highest

535
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
possible point for sales

536
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,679
and yes it takes a great deal of

537
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,080
conviction to do that but it also

538
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
doesn't demand it

539
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
you can wait for this pattern to give it

540
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
to you

541
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
by waiting for the break above the

542
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
market structure here

543
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
which

544
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
is ironic because

545
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
you don't

546
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,400
get that same forgivingness

547
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
with the next pattern we're going to

548
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,679
talk about which is the failure swing

549
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
all right this is the failure swings is

550
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,960
the second

551
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
form of institutional swing points again

552
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
i understand

553
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
that you know

554
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
you probably understand this a little

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,000
bit but i'm giving you some additional

556
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
points because if we're going to start

557
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
breaking the market down into modular

558
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
form where we can go in and start

559
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,760
utilizing these things not just speak

560
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
about them in broad terms

561
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
i want you to narrow your focus to only

562
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
two ways of viewing the marketplace when

563
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679
it turns

564
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,360
we already mentioned the breaker swing

565
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
point and now we're talking about the

566
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
failure swing

567
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
the failure swing is when you identify

568
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,080
when there is a

569
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
resistance level and it trades through

570
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
it

571
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
breaks down

572
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,559
and comes back and retests it

573
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,440
it can't make another pass through

574
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
now this level could be up here it could

575
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
have been just touching it here

576
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
and then failed to make another pass to

577
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,679
it it's the same thing in same

578
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,080
conditions but we're focusing primarily

579
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,600
on is the ability for the market to get

580
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
back to this high and make a higher high

581
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
or the fact that it makes a failure

582
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
swing

583
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,000
we don't ever know with great deal of

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
conviction if we're gonna get the

585
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,600
breaker set up

586
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
so while this may be unfolding we could

587
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,039
be anticipating this high being taken

588
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
out to be a seller up here

589
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,640
but many times what will happen is the

590
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
market will come up and fall short

591
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
and then break lower

592
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,120
and that's a missed opportunity we can't

593
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
be a seller at a high price

594
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,799
we may have may have even second guessed

595
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
this entry as a short but we are

596
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
demanding a breaker to occur

597
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
which would be selling above this old

598
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
high but it doesn't give it to you here

599
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
that would be a missed opportunity but

600
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,679
it doesn't mean there's no trading

601
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,880
opportunity

602
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
same thing can be said for the buy side

603
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,000
we have a support level down here the

604
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
market trades down into it may trade

605
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
through it or the blue line representing

606
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
our support level could be down here

607
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
right at the low it's not important as

608
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
it relates to

609
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
where the actual level is what we're

610
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,039
anticipating is is the market's gonna

611
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
probably make another pass through and

612
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,880
retest this low

613
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,080
again we're aiming for and trying to get

614
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,559
breaker swing points if we don't get the

615
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,960
breaker swing point that's not a problem

616
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
we have an opportunity to trade off of

617
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,039
this pattern as well

618
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,000
if we get the buy

619
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
set up like this and it retraces off of

620
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
the the level that we are anticipating

621
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
seeing support at

622
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,559
and it comes back and starts to come

623
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
back down and fails and makes one more

624
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
pass up if it takes out this short term

625
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,559
high

626
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
or on the sell side takes out this short

627
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,440
term low

628
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
we have another

629
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,159
opportunity

630
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
because what we have here is the

631
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
market's already shown a willingness to

632
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,679
do what it's run an area of liquidity

633
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,720
out

634
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,679
it's trap traders above here

635
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
and traders below here so sellers are

636
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
stuck down here

637
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
and buyers are stuck up here

638
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
they're not giving them an opportunity

639
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
to get out

640
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,360
they're quickly repricing here

641
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
so now when we understand that think

642
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
like an institutional trader

643
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
if you know

644
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,679
you have

645
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
a guy on the hook or a fund on the hook

646
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,200
up here

647
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
he's he's long now

648
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,799
if you can

649
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,600
reprice the market and go lower with it

650
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
leave them holding the bag up here

651
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,799
or vice versa they sold on some weakness

652
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,280
down here because again think like those

653
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
turtle traders long-term position

654
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
traders they're selling on a breakout

655
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
they're selling below 20 period lows and

656
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,000
buying above 20 period highs

657
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
so if we can see this phenomenon taking

658
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
place where they've moved away from a

659
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,159
low aggressively came down but failed to

660
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,240
make a low and then broke through a

661
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
short-term high

662
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
in an area where we anticipate

663
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,919
bullishness on an institutional basis

664
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,120
we have to sit back and simply just wait

665
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,240
because we'll understand that this

666
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
movement could have been moved into a

667
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
order block that's bullish this could be

668
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,799
a bearish order block this could be a

669
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
move that goes into a old high to run

670
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
out buy stops here

671
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
it could be an older hot you know height

672
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,919
is not being shown in this diagram just

673
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,559
like this could be an older low

674
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,760
you know to the left of the truck that

675
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,600
wouldn't be shown in this diagram but

676
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
we're seeing the evidences that they've

677
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
already did the manipulation down here

678
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,919
we don't know that for certain until

679
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
we see the retracement back up

680
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,640
here so all this retracement here

681
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
this is a gray area we don't know for

682
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,120
certain if this is going to stop here or

683
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
if it's going to continue up

684
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,039
and give us a break or swing point

685
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,320
just like we don't know that there's

686
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,559
going to be a continuation to go lower

687
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,679
to have a

688
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
breaker swing point for buys here we

689
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
don't know if it's going to go down

690
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,240
below that low i never know that for

691
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
certain i never know that i anticipated

692
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
the most optimal entry i'm looking for

693
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
that scenario but it may not give it to

694
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,960
me so if it doesn't

695
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
and it starts to run the other way i'm

696
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
just simply going to put my eye sight

697
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,919
right here for the buy and here for the

698
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
cell

699
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,200
if i can't get a retracement back here

700
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
or on an idea for a short

701
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,159
if i don't see anything to justify a

702
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
short here and sometimes that occurs

703
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
sometimes i just you know i don't get it

704
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,520
right and i'm human just like anybody

705
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
else will if i can't get a short off

706
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,559
there and i don't have strong

707
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
convictions to sell there it's no

708
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,000
problem i'm going to just simply wait

709
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,880
for that

710
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
swing point right here to be violated

711
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,039
and then i'm going to be aiming for this

712
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
level right there that's where i'll sell

713
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,159
now

714
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,799
if i'm going to sell at this level here

715
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,039
i can have great confidence that myself

716
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,559
can be protected with a buy stop right

717
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,559
above this short-term high because it's

718
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,880
in inside this area at which they had

719
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,039
already ran the stops out on the form of

720
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
buy stops so if my buy stop is here now

721
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
they're not going to come back up here

722
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
and give these opportunity to get off

723
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
they're not going to let them out

724
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
so i can be a seller here with my stop

725
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
here and look for lower prices

726
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
same way can the same thing can be said

727
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,880
here

728
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
if i don't know with great deal of

729
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
conviction that this is a good buy

730
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
or i miss it and it takes off it's no

731
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
problem i'm waiting for this little

732
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
swing point here to be broken

733
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,279
once that high is broken

734
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,880
i can wait for price to come back down

735
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
to this level right here

736
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,120
when this level is retreated to down

737
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
here

738
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
i can be a buyer with a great deal of

739
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
confidence that my stop loss can be

740
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,039
placed just below this low because it's

741
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,400
going to be in an area where they had

742
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
already ran the cell stops

743
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,279
now

744
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,279
this is probably very 101 ict okay but i

745
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
want you to come away with this idea

746
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
that the institutions

747
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,799
go into the marketplace to trap

748
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,640
or they go into knock off that's what

749
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,760
they do

750
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
they are in the business of knocking the

751
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
funds out when they're going to be

752
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,799
correct

753
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
and they'd like to put them in on the

754
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
wrong side when they have pending orders

755
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
that are allow them to be offside for

756
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
instance in this case here

757
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
funds could have buy stops here with the

758
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,919
expectation if it goes out they're

759
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,679
thinking this could be a long-term trend

760
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,919
filing buy program where they can hold

761
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
on to it for many months

762
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,840
the institutions will drive the price up

763
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,799
there

764
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,960
take those buy stops in but when those

765
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
buy stocks become market orders to buy

766
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
they're selling

767
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,679
with the expectation they're going to

768
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,720
reprice aggressively and then go short

769
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,559
i may read it wrong just like you're

770
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,320
going to read it wrong i may be looking

771
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,159
for a breaker scenario up here where it

772
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,559
makes a pass above this old high i may

773
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,240
be looking to sell

774
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,559
this old high on turtle suit it may

775
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,919
never give it to me

776
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,240
and i may not be astute enough watching

777
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
price to see this is the scenario to

778
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
really be selling at

779
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,840
so if i miss it

780
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,679
just like you're going to miss it too

781
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,760
and you see this breakdown in here no

782
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
problem wait for it to trade back up to

783
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
this level here and that's where your

784
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
shorts going to be and your your

785
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,520
position is going to be protected with a

786
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
stop loss right above this high it's

787
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,799
going to be in an area where it's

788
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,720
already been traded to

789
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,559
with manipulation

790
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,000
buy stops have already been violated

791
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,919
here they're not going to come back up

792
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,080
to take those out if it does you're

793
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,640
probably wrong anyway you want to be out

794
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
same thing is said over here just in

795
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,279
opposite terms

796
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,480
when the market comes down here and

797
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
rejects you you may not see that

798
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
initially as a rejection you may

799
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,799
anticipate one more pass lower to get

800
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,640
that ideal buy

801
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
and it doesn't do it and if you can't

802
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,159
get this off as a long

803
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,919
and it starts to take off no problem you

804
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
go right back to this price point here

805
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,960
and wait for it to come back down you

806
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
can be a trader that takes a long

807
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
position there with your stop-loss right

808
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,120
here

809
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
again with the expectation that if your

810
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
stop loss is already below this low

811
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,880
you're in an area where they already ran

812
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,799
out sell stops so there's no reason for

813
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,240
them to come back down there again

814
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,159
especially if they have a very dynamic

815
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
price response here

816
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
the the magnitude of which they move

817
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,039
away here

818
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,399
and the magnitude at which they move

819
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,640
away here indicates that they have

820
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
already trapped a sizable

821
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,080
number of orders net long here

822
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,279
and seismo orders that are net short

823
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,200
here they're not going to want to let

824
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,399
them off

825
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
and if they are short

826
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,360
how can they get out of their short

827
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
position if they aggressively reprice

828
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
higher

829
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
they're going to collapse their trade by

830
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,679
doing what buying it back they're going

831
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,200
to reprice quickly so that way they

832
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,799
force them to buy back at a higher price

833
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,640
where they can now start scaling off

834
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
their position that they bought down

835
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,799
here and down here

836
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,360
at a net profit

837
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,919
and the opposites being said here where

838
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,200
they could quickly reprice here

839
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
smart money sells here and sells here so

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,320
if price aggressively moves lower

841
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,760
those that are

842
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,159
along in this point here they're going

843
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,440
to want to collapse their trade and they

844
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,279
have to sell it so they're not going to

845
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
sell it down here

846
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,120
where smart money can buy it back after

847
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
being short from this point here

848
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,440
so when we look at price

849
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
i want you to think again in two

850
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,399
institutional swing point theories

851
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,200
you have a breaker which is the ideal

852
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,960
most optimal trade entry pattern there

853
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,039
is in the marketplace because it's

854
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,480
absolutely the deepest discount buy

855
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,760
and the absolute most premium to sell

856
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,320
it's scary to do it it's absolutely

857
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
uncomfortable when you first start doing

858
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
it and i i know what that feels like

859
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
it's scary but that's the whole purpose

860
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
of getting into a demo account where you

861
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
learn to do those types of things you

862
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
cannot learn it doing with live money

863
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
that's all part of this mentorship you

864
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
have to be practicing in a demo where

865
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,039
you can literally go in there and step

866
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,399
in front of the marketplace once it

867
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,240
rolls into a new high

868
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,520
sell it

869
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,679
get that responsiveness of seeing what

870
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,360
happens in price sometimes it'll keep on

871
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
going okay no problem you're gonna be

872
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,120
wrong but you're gonna know right away

873
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,720
that you're wrong and you don't have a

874
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
hundred pip stop on you can have a

875
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
relatively

876
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
modest stop one

877
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,679
point is

878
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
when you're right you get immediate

879
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
feedback and it's very encouraging it's

880
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,919
confidence building and usually if you

881
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,279
enter on the right side and you're

882
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,679
selling an old high

883
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,679
it's amazing because you'll see how fast

884
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,200
the market tanks

885
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,039
if you buy an old low and you're doing

886
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,200
it on a breaker setup and it's a swing

887
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
point in the form of a breaker you're

888
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
going to be able to see dynamic rallies

889
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
just like that take off and it would

890
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
they'll be explosive

891
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,200
so

892
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
don't think in terms of classical char

893
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,799
patterns like head and shoulders or

894
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,559
think in terms of uh

895
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
bear flags and bull flags things like

896
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,200
that

897
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,799
only try to convince yourself that

898
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,640
there's only two real ways the market's

899
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,080
going to turn around it's going to be on

900
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,760
a breaker where they run stops or it's

901
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,000
going to be a failure swing both of them

902
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,039
are indicating a manipulation but they

903
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,600
both have to be used slightly different

904
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,120
the first one being the breaker swing

905
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,960
point that is the ideal one you want to

906
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,559
be looking for that scenario all the

907
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
time on any time frame not just a daily

908
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
chart but any time frame

909
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,960
but if you can't get the breaker

910
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,399
don't fear

911
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
or be upset about missing that move

912
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
because it still gives you the

913
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,440
opportunity to get in there because

914
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
they're only going to turn the market

915
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,279
one of these ways that's it and nothing

916
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,960
else happens in price

917
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,120
i challenge you to go in and show me

918
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,559
something where that doesn't do this

919
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,240
because i can tell you it's either a

920
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,399
breaker or it's a fair swing every

921
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,880
single time it's never anything else so

922
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,399
you're you're limited it's really just

923
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
two conditions in the marketplace if

924
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,520
you're going to be a seller how are you

925
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
going to be a seller you're going to be

926
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,159
selling it at ohi or you're going to be

927
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,919
selling it on a retracement back to a

928
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,320
break in market structure that's it

929
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
if you're going to be a buyer are you

930
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,440
going to be buying an old low

931
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,120
or are you going to be buying on a

932
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,039
return or retracement back to a market

933
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,679
structure break to be a buyer at support

934
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,399
there

935
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,480
it's just that simple nothing else can

936
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,799
happen there's no there's not 50 000

937
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,640
patterns to be looking for there's not

938
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,320
all these different candlestick patterns

939
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,880
to memorize okay new dark clouds

940
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,640
covering this and no inverted hammer

941
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,120
that it's just simply understanding

942
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
where are the orders

943
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
relative to old institutional order flow

944
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
reference points key support resistance

945
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,159
on high time frames

946
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,320
how is the market behaving at that level

947
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
did was it able to pass through it and

948
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,679
did it reject

949
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,360
if it went up to it fell short it's

950
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
probably going to make one more pass

951
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
higher and it might give you that

952
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,960
breaker entry

953
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
if it doesn't give you a breaker inch

954
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,600
and it gives you a fair swing this is

955
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
how you trade them

956
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,279
but there's nothing you need to worry

957
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,399
about

958
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,080
in a demo account while you're teaching

959
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,159

about rushing to get in with live money

961
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,760
if you don't know the characteristics

962
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,480
between these two swing point theories

963
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,519
you're going to hurt yourself you're

964
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
