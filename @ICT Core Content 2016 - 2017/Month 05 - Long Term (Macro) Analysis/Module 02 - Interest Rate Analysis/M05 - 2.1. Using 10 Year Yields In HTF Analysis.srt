1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,840
welcome back folks this is lesson 2.1 of

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
january 2017 ict mentorship

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
we'll be teaching

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
using 10-year yields in a higher time

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,439
frame analysis

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
okay 10-year notes in higher time frame

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
analysis you can see here on the right

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
hand side we have a seasonal tendency

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,520
for the 10-year treasury note

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,040
and i want to take a look at the

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
seasonal tendency chart for a minute

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,399
and try to

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
see where the most

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
significant price swings occur

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,239
and don't worry we'll be able to zoom in

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,399
in a moment but you can see primarily

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
there is a january february high

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,200
it trades down to a june low

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
and then a june low trading up into

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
december's highs

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
so there's two primary or dominant

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
cycles in the seasonal for

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
treasury notes

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
and it's bearish for the first half of

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
the year and then bullish for the second

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
part of the year

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
this teaching is going to give us an

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
example where that takes place

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
and we're also going to see when the

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
seasonal tendency doesn't have an

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
influence on

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
the market and we're also going to see

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
when the market actually performs

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
adversely or contrary to the seasonal

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
tendency

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,759
okay before we get into it some quick

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,920
notes for you when we chart the 10-year

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
treasury prices or the futures contract

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
we're using barchart.com

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
when we chart the 10-year treasury

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
yields

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
we'll be using investing.com both of

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
these websites are free

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,920
and some quick notes for you treasury

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
prices are inverted to its yield

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
as treasury prices

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
drop that means the futures contract for

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,399
the 10-year treasury notes when that

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,479
price drops on the chart

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,439
that shows a treasury yields increase

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
as treasury prices rise

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,280
treasury yields decline

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,840
as a general rule of thumb long-term

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
funds

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,520
seek yield that means money will be

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
placed or

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
allocated in areas at which it will seek

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
the majority or most

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
return on investment

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
okay the dollar index has it relatively

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
easy or it can rally when the yields

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,040
increase

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
and this is seen when the futures

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
contract prices drop on the 10-year note

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,720
and the dollar has its easiest or most

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,959
opportune time to decline

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
when yields decrease

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,319
this is seen when the treasury futures

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
price rise

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
okay here we have a zoomed in

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
seasonal tendency on the 10-year

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
treasury note

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,239
and i want to take your attention to the

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
first portion of

75
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
the seasonal tendency and this is in

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,800
january to february there's a high that

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
generally forms and it trades down into

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
around june

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
or middle of the year

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
and around june july

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
it's really like the last week of may

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
really if you look at it it's the last

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
week of may

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,959
and

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
rolls into the first week of july

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
usually it makes a seasonal low there

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
and in the 10-year treasury notes

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
usually rally the rest of the year

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
now

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,000
if we have

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,159
this seasonal tendency on the underlying

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
futures contract price in other words

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
on the treasury prices

94
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
this is not the yield the yield would be

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
inverted okay so in other words if we're

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,439
watching the june july low and prices on

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
the 10-year are rallying

98
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
that means interest rates are actually

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
dropping

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
so it's going to be an adverse effect or

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,959
inverted

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
effect on the yield

103
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,599
if we see this occurring

104
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,720
in the

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,199
10-year treasury

106
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,798
we should be seeing what in the

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,960
dollar index if we could show a seasonal

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
tenancy which we happen to have one in

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
the next slide by the way

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
if we have the dollar index as a

111
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,919
seasonal tendency

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
should this be occurring

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,120
at the same time that we see the june

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
july rally

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
should that be occurring with

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
a bullish or bearish move in the dollar

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
index

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
uh here's that seasonal tendency for the

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
dollar

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
and you can see

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
around the january february time there's

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
usually a rally that takes place which

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
is

124
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
contrary to what we saw in the 10-year

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
treasury notes declining

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
then we have a significant high forming

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,120
between

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
june and july

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
and then the dollar index typically

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
trades down the rest of the year usually

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
making a low around the last week of

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
october first week of november and it

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
creates a small little bounce on

134
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
november time period for

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
the dollar index

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
so the primary two trends in this market

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,759
for the dollar that is in alignment with

138
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,120
the seasonal tendencies seen in the

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
tenure

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
is there is a bearish tone to the

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
marketplace for the dollar index

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
mid-june

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
to july

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,160
and then we also see some rallying on

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,520
the dollar index the beginning of the

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,400
year

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,720
going into march

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
now there is a seasonal tendency for

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
dollar to decline march into may

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
but that would have to be in bearish

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
markets

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
and in bullish markets you could expect

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,320
to see november be a buy

154
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,759
may

155
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,039
be a buy

156
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
and january be a buy for dollar index

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,840
and the sales come in that

158
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,360
march june july

159
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
and there's one in uh september

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
and it usually creates uh some short uh

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
high in the latter portion of november

162
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
let's go back to the 10-year treasury

163
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
notes just for a moment

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
okay you see there's a strong

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,440
contrast between the two

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,039
and that means that we do have a high

167
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,560
probability scenario for if

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
the 10-year treasury notes are rallying

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
in the in the futures price

170
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,199
that means that the yield

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
will be doing the opposite they'll be

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
going down so interest rates will be

173
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,160
dropping

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,919
the interest rates are dropping that's

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,960
going to cause the tendency for

176
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
yield seeking traders or investors to

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
avoid the dollar index

178
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
because if the interest rates are

179
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,039
dropping

180
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,720
that's not going to

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
incite wanting to buy

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,479
dollar-based assets

183
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
so

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
the reason why we're seeing this adverse

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,720
effect here is because there is a direct

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
inverted relationship between the two

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
so if we have this blending of these two

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
markets it gives us a context to work

189
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
with if we're going to be looking for

190
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
quarterly shifts in the marketplace okay

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
here's the 10-year treasury note this is

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
the

193
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
september contract of 2015.

194
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
and remember that we saw the seasonal

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
tendency to form a low in june july

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
and a 10-year treasury node

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
contract for september because the u

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,599
in

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,319
symbols name znu15

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
left hand corner that u stands for the

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
month of september that's the delivery

202
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,840
contract of september

203
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,199
you can see that the contract prices or

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,160
treasury note prices started to rally in

205
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,039
june

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
that means that the yields are going to

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
be decreasing or declining and that's

208
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,720
going to be bearish for the dollar index

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
you see in june july we made a

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,919
short-term high traded lower we violated

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,520
the low in may

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
and then look what happens between

213
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,479
mid-june

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,199
into july and august

215
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
the dollar index actually has a little

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
bit of a rally

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
at the same time going back to that

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
september contract of treasury notes

219
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
10-year

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,159
the same time the treasury notes were

221
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,440
rallying

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
with its seasonal tenancy if we look at

223
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
the dollar index

224
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
it was slightly bullish as well so when

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
we see this scenario

226
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
we are looking at the likelihood if

227
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
they're moving in tandem that means

228
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
we're actually going to be in a large

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,959
consolidation

230
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,160
that means it's not going to be a

231
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
trending environment most likely and

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
that means we want to look for previous

233
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
highs and previous lows to be violated

234
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
and back to the middle of the range

235
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,399
you can see that was the effect here

236
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,040
after july and august

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
the late part of august we came all the

238
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
way down took out the may june lows

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
the market essentially for the dollar

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
index moved sideways

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
2016 september contract of 10-year

242
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,360
treasury notes again we can see that

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
last week of may going into june that

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,360
seasonal tendency for a load of form for

245
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
10-year treasury notes 10-year treasury

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
notes rally

247
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
all up into july

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
and that should give us a bear stance

249
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
for the dollar index the same time

250
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,000
[Music]

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
and as you can see we did have a bearish

252
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
decline in the last week of may going

253
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
into june and it gave one more lower low

254
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,160
in the lighter portion of june but look

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,600
what happens again

256
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
we have the dollar index rally one more

257
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
time and again we'll go back to the

258
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
previous slides you can see the 10-year

259
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
treasury note

260
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
see i have a slightly higher high going

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
into july as well

262
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
and then we saw that and we saw that

263
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
one more higher high pushed into the

264
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
dollar index in the latter portions of

265
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,640
july

266
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,200
again this is going to be an indication

267
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
that the markets are going to be in a

268
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
large consolidation

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
so think about what we've already shown

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
here if the market's showing the

271
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
tendency to be in a large consolidation

272
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
why

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,399
because both

274
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,240
yield

275
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
and dollar

276
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,399
ten year treasuries and the dollar are

277
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
moving in the same direction if that

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
occurs what we're looking at is

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
long-term indecisiveness and that means

280
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
because both of them are moving in

281
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
tandem

282
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,440
the likelihood of a continued

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
directional trade higher or lower for

284
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,560
either one is highly unlikely so we

285
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
would be focusing on looking for stop

286
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,079
raids

287
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
or looking for if the data range to look

288
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
back and see previous highs and lows to

289
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
be violated

290
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
when both

291
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
treasury and on the dollar index so if

292
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
we're looking at this condition what do

293
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
you suppose that does for foreign

294
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,160
currencies

295
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
it does several things number one it

296
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
puts you in a long-term consolidation on

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
foreign currencies because the dollar is

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,279
in consolidation and treasuries are

299
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
under consolidation

300
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
if we see times when the treasury market

301
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
is in fact moving in its seasonal

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,880
tenancy

303
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
and the dollar is supporting that same

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
seasonal tendency then we have a strong

305
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,440
probability of a directional long-term

306
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,399
trend

307
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
and that's where the large funds place

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
their money when you get into the

309
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
marketplace on those moves you have

310
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
these long periods of many weeks several

311
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
months in terms of

312
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,959
one directional

313
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
bias moves in other words long-term

314
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
trends

315
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,160
okay our next example

316
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,079
now we're looking at the march contract

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
of the 10-year treasury notes for 2017

318
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
and i'm using this contract because it

319
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
allows me to show the data

320
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,800
for

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
the latter portion of 2016 and going

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
into present trading day

323
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
you can see here

324
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
that treasury

325
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
market seasonal tendency to create a

326
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,399
high in november

327
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
and let's go back to that seasonal

328
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,079
tendency just so you guys can see it

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
okay here's the seasonal tendency once

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,079
again for the 10-year treasury note all

331
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,360
the way to the far right you can see

332
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,440
that green line that vertical line that

333
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
most furthest to the right

334
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
that furthest most right green vertical

335
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
line that delineates the beginning of

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,839
the trading for the march delivery

337
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,839
contract you can see that that actually

338
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,560
makes the high of the march contract

339
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,320
and it starts to trade off lower from

340
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,079
that price point

341
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
that seasonal tendency to create that

342
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
high for a march contract is going to be

343
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,360
influential

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
for us in that next slide that we just

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
looked at

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
so here we are back again that same

347
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
10-year treasury notes slide

348
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
for 2017's march contract

349
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
now we had the

350
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,480
presidential election obviously in 2016

351
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
and what we're looking at is that high

352
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
that

353
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
the election results shown for donald

354
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,800
trump

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
making our

356
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
president-elect at that

357
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
time of vote

358
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
the seasonal tendency for the march

359
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
contract could create a high you can see

360
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
that came into effect in november

361
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
so while we're looking at

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,240
the end of that uptrend for the seasonal

363
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
tendency on the 10-year treasury note

364
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
we're looking at the beginning of a

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
seasonal high

366
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
and that gives us that movement going

367
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
lower into the latter portions of

368
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
december and that's what you see here

369
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,200
that's transpired 2016. if we see this

370
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
occurring

371
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
okay and it's now trending it's not in

372
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
consolidation it's down trending for the

373
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
10-year treasury notes that's going to

374
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
provide the opportunity for the dollar

375
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,240
index to do the opposite but also do it

376
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
in a fashion that's in a trending mode

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,040
you see in november we had that same in

378
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
fact just in opposite terms where the

379
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,279
election shown the sell-off in the

380
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,120
10-year treasury notes

381
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
that sell-off shows an increase in

382
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,959
interest rates which means there's going

383
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,199
to be an interest to now buy dollar

384
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,959
because it's going to be going higher as

385
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,199
the 10-year treasury is dropping

386
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,040
interest rates are increasing which

387
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
means

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
that there's going to be buyers that's

389
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
going to be seeking yield by buying the

390
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
dollar index

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,880
and you can see the market did in fact

392
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,639
have a trending environment trying

393
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,079
trending higher then creating a

394
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,839
short-term low in december and finally

395
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
making its high

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
in the first portion of

397
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,600
december of this year

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,639
so the moral of all this is that if we

399
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
study the 10-year treasury notes in its

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
price action

401
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
it's either going to be moving in its

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
seasonal tendency or if the dollar index

403
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,240
moves in tandem with it that suggests

404
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,279
that we're going to be in a large

405
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
consolidation

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
if you look at all the currency pairs

407
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
that we

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,720
trade in the form of the british pound

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,160
the euro dollar those pairs were in big

410
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
consolidations all through the mid

411
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
portion of 2016.

412
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,880
that was attributed to the consolidation

413
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
that we saw in the 10-year treasury note

414
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,839
and the dollar index because they're

415
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,079
basically moving in the same direction

416
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,120
but they were

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
range bound that's going to translate

418
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
into range bound trading as well the

419
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,959
only caveat is going to be until we saw

420
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,560
the brexit vote

421
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,880
and that's obviously going to be the big

422
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
impact for

423
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,199
the latter portions of the summer months

424
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
but prior to that everything in the

425
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,760
marketplace we saw was all range bound

426
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,000
for currency trading so now one of the

427
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
things i said about this month that's

428
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,199
going to be helpful to you is when are

429
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,399
you looking for a trade that's going to

430
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,120
be explosive and trending

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
when the 10-year treasury notes seasonal

432
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
tendency is in effect you see it

433
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
happening and it's supported with the

434
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
contrary in price

435
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
action you see in the dollar index as we

436
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
described here

437
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
if they are not showing that chances are

438
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,839
we're going to be in a range bound

439
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,759
consolidation and that means you're

440
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,079
going to be focusing on very short-term

441
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
moves that means it's going to be high

442
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,079
probability for short-term trades and

443
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,600
day trades and

444
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
highly unlikely for long-term position

445
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
trades long-term position trades are

446
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,160
going to be favorable in the conditions

447
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,759
we've just shown here when we see

448
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
10-year treasury notes moving in

449
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
trending environments

450
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,560
that's going to put the dollar index

451
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,639
into a trending environment

452
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,079
also if we see the absence of the

453
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
seasonal tendency

454
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
the strongest in the form of the buy

455
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
signal for 10-year treasury notes around

456
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
june july

457
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
if that's not occurring then we're going

458
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
to be focusing on where the highs form

459
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
seasonally in the seasonal tendency for

460
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
the 10-year treasury units to get

461
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,079
ourselves in sync with the opposite

462
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,600
scope in other words just because the

463
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,279
seasonal tendency is the strongest as a

464
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,240
buy

465
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,120
in june july for 10-year treasuries

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,359
doesn't mean that when that is not the

467
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,880
case because the markets are not always

468
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,119
doing the same thing every single time

469
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,240
we can focus primarily being a bearish

470
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
10-year note trader which would give us

471
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
the november high as we indicated here

472
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,839
which lined up also for the season z4

473
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,000
our election this year

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,679
so we're going to build on this model

475
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
here in the next teaching and until then

476
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,720
wish good luck and good trading
