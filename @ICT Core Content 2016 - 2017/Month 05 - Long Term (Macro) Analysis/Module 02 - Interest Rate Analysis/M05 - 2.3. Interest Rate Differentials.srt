1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,920
okay folks welcome back this is lesson

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,800
2.3 of the january 2017 ict mentorship

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,840
we're looking at interest rate

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
differentials

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
okay central bank interest rates

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,439
if we're going to be looking at a macro

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
view it really needs to start here

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,079
and there's several places on the

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,680
internet you can go to get this list but

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
this is the global

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
currency

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,760
interest rates from the central banks

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
this is the list you can get from

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
fxstreet.com

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
you do a simple google search and in the

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,399
notes for the pdf i'll have all the

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
links for all these things

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
even though they don't show up in the

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
actual presentations in your pdf file

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
like i said the notes will be rich with

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,199
details about where to get the

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,480
information from and what you can do

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,680
with it

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
but this list is from

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760
fxstreet.com

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,799
and

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,320
what you want to do is

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
when you look at the list and obviously

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
it's a rather anemic

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
list of interest rates currently in the

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
current state of uh

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
the global economy

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
but generally there's always going to be

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,920
a

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,159
higher interest rate among another

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
currency versus another

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,119
country

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,479
and basically what you're going to do is

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
you simply look for

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
a currency or country in this case

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
that has a high interest rate

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
as you see here the highest on this list

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
is the reserve bank of new zealand

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,759
the second in the

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,840
high end of the interest rates would be

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
reserve bank of australia

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
and obviously the low end would be the

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,600
bank of japan

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
and the swiss bank

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
and

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
the european central bank at zero we're

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
going to go through this in

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,360
two passes in other words we're going to

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
find two trading examples on a higher

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
time frame basis using interest rate

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
differentials

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
starting with the interest rates that

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,479
are pegged at the central bank level

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
now again if we're looking at this this

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319
is going to cut to what fundamental

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
basis there is to buy or sell a

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
particular currency

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
uh you can't get any more fundamental

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
than interest rates so

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
if we're going to look at these

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,239
countries

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
if we pick for instance

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
a currency that we want to be a buyer of

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,720
obviously money seeks yield so it makes

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
perfect sense to be a buyer of

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,599
australian

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
or new zealand currency

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
if you're expecting weakness in a

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,280
particular country or in a

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
country's economy

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
you can see that in the form of a weak

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
interest rate

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
for that particular currency or that

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
country

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
uh swiss national bank

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
bank of japan

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
european central bank

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
bank of canada

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
bank of england

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
even federal reserve really it's very

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
low end

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
on the interest rate curve

88
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,400
based on this list here

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
so if we were to

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,519
take a look at these countries

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,000
we could build a model on a higher time

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
frame basis

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,360
on long-term macro trades which have the

94
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
most opportunity to move

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,879
based on a fundamental

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,560
establishment of

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
interest rates being utilized for

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
the selection process

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
put in other words

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
funds will seek to trade high yielding

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
currencies

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
and place that

103
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
against a weak yielding currency

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
and they will look to buy strong

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,239
currencies and sell against weak

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,319
currencies and they will look to sell

107
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
against currencies and buy against

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
strong currencies in other words they're

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
going to be buying strong payers and

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,319
selling weak pairs

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
all right let's take a look at selecting

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
a pair for trading

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
first thing you do is you want to look

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
for a country that has a high interest

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
rate

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,919
then you want to select a country with a

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,759
low interest rate

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
it doesn't have to be the lowest of the

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,960
low it doesn't have to be the highest of

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
the high it can be just a very strong

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
difference between the two

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
interest rates

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
and then obviously once you select the

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
high end and the low end currency

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
or country in this respective currency

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
obviously

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,759
you're going to determine the forex pair

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,400
coupling based on those two

129
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
respective countries

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
for an example we're going to assume

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,479
that the australian dollar is our

132
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,240
selection for our high interest rate

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
yielding country

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
and the interest rate comes in at 1.5

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
percent

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
and we're going to pair that up with a

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
weaker currency from the federal reserve

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
which is the u.s market

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
with a 0.75 percent or three-quarter

140
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,600
point

141
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,840
now i'm going to have to remind you that

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
this data is

143
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,120
factored in with a interest rate hike of

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
25 basis points so

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,240
at the time of the trade we're going to

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
actually review the federal reserve

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,680
central bank rate was at 0.50

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
but when we look at this the way we

149
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
couple that up for a 4x pair

150
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
obviously the australian dollar

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
pair is what we'd be looking at

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
once we arrive at our currency that

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
we're going to be focusing on being a

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
buyer of buying strength against a

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
weaker currency for instance the dollar

156
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
index here

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
we're looking for strong support on a

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
higher time frame chart now we're

159
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
thinking long-term macro perspective

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
so we're only looking for

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
large moves in a fund level trend

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,199
following idea but before we get to that

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
point we have to expect

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
some sizable move that's going to be

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
positioned with

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,600
big flows behind it

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
again we're fundamentally aligning

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,960
ourselves with the central bank interest

169
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
rates

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
we're coupling a pair based on a high

171
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
yield interest rate 1.5 percent

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
versus a

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
half of one percent at the time of the

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
trade but in this case we have to show

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
the numbers as they are here now uh 0.75

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,919
percent

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
we wait for smart money clues that it's

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
being bought now we went through several

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,759
of those things that indicates that in

180
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,600
the mentorship so far

181
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
but we'll revisit a few of them for this

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
example

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
seasonal tendency and or open interest

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
can confirm this

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
so there's our two elements of smart

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,479
money tools that we can use it doesn't

187
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,880
have to use every possible scenario we

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,000
only need one or two to confirm

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and we are looking for us dollar index

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
directional confirmation that qualifies

191
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,319
the setup

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,440
okay we're going to look at the

193
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
australian dollar

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
this is the cash price for australian

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
dollar

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
and we identified a long-term support

197
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,479
level old low in the form of 71.50

198
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
and we move over to our

199
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
march contract 2017 of australian dollar

200
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
which would be the active contract that

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
you would be trading at the end of

202
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
december 2016.

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
we're going to add that 7150 level on

204
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
our chart you can see price has traded

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
into that as support

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
now i want you to take a closer look at

207
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
what's going on with open interest

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
as you see open interest has been

209
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
declining

210
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
and notice this big reduction here

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
that purple line dropping like that

212
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
that's a massive reduction in open

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
interest open interest

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
is going to be a

215
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
indication that there's short covering

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,280
by way of the smart money or large

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
commercial traders

218
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,199
if they're short covering

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,560
that means that they're not trying to

220
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,639
assume the other side of the trade for

221
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,039
buyers they want to reset themselves

222
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,879
because they anticipate what if they

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,759
don't want to be short they're

224
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
anticipating sharply higher prices

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
and that's what you get here off that

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
71.50 now look at the look at the

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
magnitude of the move

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
seen

229
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
with the australian dollar here

230
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,919
remember the payer that we're trading in

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
the forex market is aussie dollar all z

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,320
has

233
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
that higher 1.5 interest rate

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
the federal reserve was offering 0.50

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
to the latter part of december where it

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,160
was adjusted for another 25 basis point

237
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,120
pike

238
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,160
so now it's

239
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
at 0.75 percent for the federal reserve

240
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
rate it's still

241
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,320
half of the interest rate that's

242
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
yielding

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
on the australian central bank consider

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,399
how much this pair has moved

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,360
from the 71.50 level

246
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
400 plus pips have been

247
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
seen from this rally

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
off of a higher time frame support level

249
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
71.50 now just because it trades in a

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
higher time frame support level

251
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,040
doesn't mean that it's going to trade

252
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,399
higher

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
but when you couple that 7150 level

254
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
which is a higher time support level or

255
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,760
an old low

256
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
and you also notice that the market has

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
seen a sudden reduction in open interest

258
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,839
which is short covering on the part of

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,839
smart money

260
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,959
and you couple the idea fundamentally

261
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
that the higher yielding interest rate

262
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
of 1.5 percent from the australian

263
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
central bank

264
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
coupled against the weaker

265
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
0.75 percent or if you want to go back

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
and use the half of one percent rate

267
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
either way

268
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,720
you're getting

269
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
a higher yield off of the australian

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,760
currency

271
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,959
versus the

272
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,920
dollar

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
and that's why we've seen such a sharp

274
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
rally and why i have been talking about

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,279
the australian dollar going higher as a

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
basis of our teaching

277
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,399
throughout this mentorship we've been

278
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,519
talking about the australian dollar

279
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,720
going higher

280
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
with respective levels that have just

281
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
recently been hit with 75 80 as that

282
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
level that we just mentioned from last

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
week

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
the fundamentals if you will

285
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
okay were

286
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
aligned with the central bank interest

287
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
rate of one and a half percent coupled

288
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
against a weaker federal reserve

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,120
0.75

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
interest rate for the dollar when you

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
have that basis and you have technicals

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,399
to support it and you're looking at a

293
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,360
hard time frame chart like this it lines

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
your pockets with wonderful

295
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,519
opportunities to continuously take large

296
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,800
moves out of the marketplace and you

297
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
don't need to be trading a lot

298
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
by looking at these higher time frame

299
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
interest rate yield scenarios

300
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
coupling it with high odds probability

301
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
technicals you get yourself in sync with

302
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,519
the most significant price moves to are

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
going to most likely surprise many of

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,560
the neophyte traders

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
you can see also that we had a higher

306
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
high in the dollar index

307
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
when we fail to make a lower low in the

308
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
australian dollar

309
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,839
okay we're going to do another example

310
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,360
we're going to select a pair with a low

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
interest rate this time

312
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,640
and we're going to select a country with

313
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,360
a high interest rate

314
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
and we're going to determine the forex

315
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,320
pair that couples for that trade

316
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,640
in this example we're going to use a

317
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,959
higher yielding currency

318
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,200
0.75 percent

319
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,519
which again that was actually

320
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,880
half of one percent of the time when

321
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,640
this trade is being shown so i have to

322
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,040
adjust it show you for your notes

323
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
versus japanese uh economy and their

324
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
central bank rate was

325
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
negative

326
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
and the two respective

327
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
countries and their currencies would be

328
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,160
paired up in the form of

329
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,800
dollar yen

330
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,639
we're going to look for strong

331
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
resistance on higher time frame charts

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,079
we're going to wait for smart money

333
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,920
clues that it's being sold in other

334
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,480
words we want to see japanese yen hit

335
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
resistance levels and show indications

336
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,399
that it wants to sell off

337
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
and we're looking for seasonal

338
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,839
tendencies and or open interest to

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
confirm the trade

340
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
and looking for dollar index directional

341
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
confirmation to qualify the up so if we

342
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
have the expectation that the weaker

343
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,839
currency is the japanese yen

344
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
interest rate basis

345
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
against the stronger of the two

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
the dollar

347
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
which has the higher yielding central

348
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,160
bank rate

349
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
we're going to see that u.s dollar

350
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
versus japanese yen

351
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,440
pair

352
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
actually go higher

353
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
because you're buying dollar and selling

354
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,320
in so if we're expecting weaker japanese

355
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
yen because of the weaker lower interest

356
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,440
rate

357
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,519
that means that the pair we coupled for

358
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,920
foreign exchange trading

359
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
the dollar yen is the pair we'll be

360
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
trading so even though we're looking for

361
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
weakness in yen

362
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
we're looking for the opposite of that

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
for the pair the way it's formed so the

364
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,440
dollar yen pair is actually going to

365
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,680
strengthen or go up in our charts

366
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
as it relates to

367
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
the cash

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
you can see the weekly chart here

369
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,639
and a bearish order block

370
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,160
at the 9800 level

371
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
right here

372
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
and that would set the stage for a move

373
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
this is the cash price of the japanese

374
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
yen

375
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,199
and price trades up into that 90 big

376
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
figure

377
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,120
and weakness is seen from that point one

378
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
obviously

379
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
this is seen on the heels of the donald

380
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,600
trump election

381
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
but nonetheless this move

382
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
many hundreds of pips

383
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
well over 1200 pips of a price move

384
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,480
and again

385
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
it's based on

386
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,199
the

387
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
central bank interest rate

388
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,160
and the differential between the two

389
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
and by having that coupled

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
with strong technicals

391
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,279
seasonal tendency

392
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,639
understanding that the market was

393
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
expected high volatility because of the

394
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,079
election

395
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,000
this massive decline

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
seen in the cash price of japanese yen

397
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,959
is also

398
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
seen in the understanding because of our

399
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
analysis or my own analysis as we were

400
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
going through the mentorship

401
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
why i was calling the dollar yen higher

402
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
all those factors for

403
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
leading us up into

404
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
those

405
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,040
commentaries

406
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,199
this was the basis behind it all having

407
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,959
the higher yielding interest rate of the

408
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
dollar versus the weaker currency

409
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,120
interest rate of the yen

410
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
and coupling that with

411
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
the technicals that we teach or use in

412
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,639
the inner circle trader

413
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,160
repertoire

414
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
it gives you these massive price moves

415
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
based on a higher time frame premise

416
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,279
so you're using these things again

417
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,360
you're not using them to day trade

418
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,000
you're not using them to facilitate

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
short-term trades but if you trade in

420
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
that direction obviously your trades

421
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,000
will be a lot higher probability but

422
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
they're more inclined to

423
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
be used on a higher time frame basis

424
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,519
because

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
the large funds because of the nature of

426
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,440
their trading style their trend filing

427
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,560
in nature

428
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
they're going to look at fundamental

429
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,120
reasons to trade specific currencies

430
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
and if you look at the moves that's

431
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,199
transpired in the last three to six

432
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,399
months

433
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
all of the big moves come by way of the

434
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
information that's drawn by the

435
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
differentials that we've discussed so

436
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,839
far here and the method of using those

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
central bank interest rates

438
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
pegging them together to get

439
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
specific currency pairs

440
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,720
and having technicals align you'll be

441
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
able to see that footprint of large

442
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,680
flows and funds pouring money into a

443
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,600
particular currency

444
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
if you look at the

445
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
dollar yen pair in relationship to this

446
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
in november you would see a strong buy

447
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,759
or a low in that particular currency

448
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,120
pair

449
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
so we're going to talk more about

450
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
differentials we're actually going to

451
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
start talking about

452
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
yield spreads also when we get into

453
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
swing trading so there's other

454
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
information we're going to talk about

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
with interest rate differentials

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
and yield spreads but for now

457
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
go through your charts and look at the

458
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
interest rate differentials between

459
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
all the weaker and higher yielding

460
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
currencies on the central bank level and

461
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
look back over the last six months and

462
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,240
see what payers you see

463
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
and find through as a homework

464
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
excitement look for setups that took

465
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
place higher timeframe support

466
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
resistance levels institutional order

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
flow ideas open interests try to

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,679
incorporate that as well on support

469
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
levels

470
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,160
and then

471
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,919
justify why

472
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,000
in hindsight now this is a good exercise

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
go back in hindsight and justify why the

474
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
fundamentals were an alignment with

475
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,240
those significant price moves and again

476
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
you're looking back three to six months

477
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
for currency pair moves to take place

478
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,760
now i don't

479
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
tell people or even advise people to

480
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
trade

481
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
exotic pairs now exotic pairs would be

482
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,880
like uh

483
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,760
euro swissy okay or something like that

484
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,559
but

485
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,280
look at some of those currency pairs to

486
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
have a higher yielding interest rate

487
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
versus a lower interest rate okay and

488
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,240
how you would pair them up in a forex

489
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
pair and look at the respective price

490
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
action in the last three to six months

491
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
on those pairs

492
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
viewing the the information that we're

493
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,559
using from the central bank level at the

494
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,880
interest rate

495
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,679
again

496
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
this is a really simplistic approach to

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,679
trading long term

498
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,760
and it's coupled with

499
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
dare i say it again a fundamental

500
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,720
application of how the funds would go in

501
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,039
and move large scale

502
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
into a particular currency or out of a

503
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
currency based on the interest rate

504
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
information that we've covered here

505
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
today until next time i wish you good

506
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
luck and good trading
