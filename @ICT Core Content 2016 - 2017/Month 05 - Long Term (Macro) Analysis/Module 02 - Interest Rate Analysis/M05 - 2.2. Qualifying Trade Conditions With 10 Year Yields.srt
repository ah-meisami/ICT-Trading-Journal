1
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,580
welcome back folks this is lesson 2.2 of

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,300
the January 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,859
we're gonna be looking at qualifying

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,900
trade conditions with the 10-year yields

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,480
okay the previous teaching 2.1 we had

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,359
looked at the 10-year node seasonal

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,759
tenancy where it has a strong tendency

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,680
to Rally in June and we're looking at

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,200
the 10-year note for September 2015 here

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,780
you can see how during the month of June

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,579
of 2015

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,760
10-year note did in fact make a low in

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,079
June

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,140
and while the seasonal tendency

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,059
is in force

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,980
how do you know the seasonal tendency is

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,899
most likely going to occur

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,820
well the first step is you want to start

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,280
looking to qualify the swings

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,860
in relationship to the dollar Index

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,719
and that's seen by looking at these

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,040
lower lows here

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
so our delineation begins at the

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
beginning of June 2015 and subsequent

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,920
lower lows

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,360
it transpired after June 2015 began

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
we start seeing a slide in price

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,400
and took out the low from May but

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,939
individually there was

30
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,580
five to six different candles

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,380
deck progressively kept making lower

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,840
lows in the first half of June that's

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,360
being delineated here but this short

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,680
little trend line

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,780
now in the dollar Index this is going to

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,939
be ideally seen

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,060
with a series of higher highs that's how

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,340
Market symmetry should

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,860
be posted and delivered in price

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,479
but let's take a look at what actually

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,799
happens in the dollar Index

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,479
at that same moment

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,820
we can see that the dollar Index

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,000
for June 2015

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,820
immediately to the right or after June

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,280
1st trading day

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
we were making lower highs

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,860
so this is a crack and correlation

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,739
and we have confirmation now there is a

50
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,220
trade idea unfolding in

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,620
to 10-year treasury note against the

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,280
dollar Index

53
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,920
it's further confirmed by

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,620
seeing the interest rate Market

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,379
declining at that time as the yield

56
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,800
declines the Futures price on a 10-year

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,879
note was actually rallying

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,879
note also

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
did the consolidation that the yield

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,879
stayed in

61
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,060
which also led to a consolidation in

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,900
dollar Index 10-year Treasury and

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,060
foreign currencies at the same time in

64
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,900
2015.

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,700
okay we're looking at the

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,099
June

67
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,760
of 2016.

68
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,379
again we're looking at that seasonal

69
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,640
tenancy

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
as seen here the market was making equal

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,280
lows so they should be seen in respect

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,800
to the dollar Index with equal highs

73
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,200
here's the dollar Index

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,519
going into June 2016.

75
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,700
did you see here the market made higher

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,220
highs this is a cracking correlation

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,220
the Market's shown a willingness to go

78
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,260
higher in the dollar Index but it was

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
not seen in the form of going lower

80
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,760
on the 10-year notes

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,379
that's a correct correlation there

82
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,980
therefore it is a qualifying condition

83
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,900
there is an underlying trade underway

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,840
this is further confirmed by visually

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,239
seeing the the interest rate Market

86
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,400
seeing it decline in the 10-year yields

87
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,120
again notice the consolidation

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,620
while it looks like if you zoomed in

89
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,480
really tight it would look like an

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,738
uptrend but we're still in a rather

91
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,418
large consolidation

92
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,839
and that is attributing factors to why

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,139
the currency markets had a consolidation

94
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,460
this period of time

95
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,060
lastly we have

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,580
the 10-year treasury note March contract

97
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
2017.

98
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,580
we have a lower high now I know you're

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,380
looking at that big wick on the

100
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,139
elections but just dispel that for a

101
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:49,919
moment

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,720
focus on the market structure alone

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,259
without that Wick we have lower high

104
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,820
formed in the first couple days of

105
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,759
November relative to the mid

106
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,520
October highs

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,720
so that should be seen

108
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,720
supported in the dollar Index as well

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,680
just contrary

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,280
in fact we see a lower low

111
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,080
so for the dollar Index to have a lower

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,220
low here

113
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,300
we should have seen

114
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,039
a higher high form in the 10-year note

115
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,360
that didn't happen

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,940
we see the opposite with a lower low

117
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,780
in dollar Index

118
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,060
we don't see the higher high in 10-year

119
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,800
treasury nodes as you would expect to

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,560
see with the lower low in dollar Index

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,300
again it's going to be a mirror image of

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,860
everything you see for perfect symmetry

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,800
when that symmetry is broken

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
it indicates there is a underlying Trend

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,699
or

126
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,740
manipulation otherwise

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,060
you can also see the open interest

128
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,340
decline in November supporting the idea

129
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,199
that there was short covering

130
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,320
by the smart money and the dollar Index

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,520
moved up as a result

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
again because

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,139
the 10-year note was in a move that was

134
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,960
trending it had more range to go lower

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,240
that supports the trending move on a

136
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,220
dollar Index where I was allowed to

137
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,039
trade for two complete months and you

138
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,080
can see it's supported with

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,060
the increase in the interest rate yield

140
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,400
on the 10-year note

141
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,560
during that time when the dollar rallied

142
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
markets seek yield and if the interest

143
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,080
rate's increasing therefore the dollar

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
has a strong tendency to own a rally as

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,300
well now as a side note

146
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,220
when we see these things occurring in

147
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,660
the price

148
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,819
you want to be blending these ideas with

149
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,979
the quarterly shift Concepts that's been

150
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,620
taught in this month's content

151
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,620
so if we're looking for the next three

152
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,440
to four months potential next swing not

153
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,940
that we're holding for that period of

154
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,120
time or our time Horizon is

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
three months out

156
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,780
generally it's going to be half that

157
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,419
time frame for the trade setups to come

158
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,759
to fruition

159
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,380
and complete

160
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,539
sometimes the trades will last longer

161
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,220
and go a full duration of three months

162
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,259
and sometimes a little bit longer but as

163
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,720
I mentioned in this mentorship my time

164
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,500
Horizon is about three months it's I I

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,020
think it's pretty much it's realistic as

166
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,580
you're gonna get because long-term

167
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,759
trends while they all generally stay in

168
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,699
the long-term trending environment

169
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,580
they can reverse and if it's in a

170
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,960
long-term uptrend you don't want to be

171
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,479
trying to pick the top so it's important

172
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,380
that

173
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,360
I remind you every time we talk about

174
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,060
this that my focus primarily is looking

175
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,220
at a time Horizon of three months with

176
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
the expectation I'm going to trade with

177
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,720
a position that may go up to three

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,419
months but rarely admittedly I don't

179
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,060
hold that long uh usually half that time

180
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,800
frame

181
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,660
but you can go in and look at these

182
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,479
times when the season will align

183
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,500
and there are qualifying smt divergences

184
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
between

185
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,800
the dollar Index and the 10-year note

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,500
when they have that pattern there you

187
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,479
can also qualify it with an interest

188
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,940
rate Triad

189
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,419
or you can go into a Forex currency pair

190
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,839
and look for the smt Divergence against

191
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,159
the dollar index that way those ideas

192
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,719
Blended together not that you need both

193
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,599
of them but one of them will give you a

194
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,640
qualification for a trade idea that may

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,320
be unfolding for a quarterly shift

196
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
by getting in sync with the marketplace

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
like this and viewing a higher time

198
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,480
frame charts with these tools in

199
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,760
alignment it gives your trades a high

200
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,839
probability

201
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,640
and it filters out a lot of the noise

202
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,339
and even if you don't trade in a

203
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,200
long-term position

204
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,839
capacity you can use these ideas to get

205
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,160
in sync with

206
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,500
higher time frame Trend or higher time

207
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,839
frame order flow and by doing that it

208
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,480
puts all your swing trade short-term

209
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,880
trade day trade and Scouts in line with

210
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740
institutional workflow and with that

211
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,959
it's very hard to go wrong not perfect

212
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,000
it doesn't negate the opportunity for

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
you to lose money but it certainly does

214
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,660
put the odds in your favor

215
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,399
until next time wish you good luck and

216
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,000
good Trading
