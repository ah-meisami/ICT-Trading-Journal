1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome back folks this is

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
lesson five of january 2017 ict

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,960
mentorship

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
i'm going to be discussing money

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,000
management and higher time frame

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
analysis

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
okay we're going to be just talking

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,239
about

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,840
a broad brush

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
perspective on this

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
view of trading in other words long term

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
analysis

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,960
we're going to assume for a moment that

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
uh everyone that's learning the concepts

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,200
from january

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,559
is

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
contemplating

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,760
uh the

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
medium of long-term trading or position

20
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,800
trading now that may not be your cup of

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,359
tea that may not be the

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,520
disciplinary trading that you are going

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
to adopt as your career

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,159
but i would advise you to at least

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
work in this time frame a little while

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
at least try to work it at least for a

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,799
year

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
and the reason why i say that is because

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,560
some of you

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
may not be

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
contemplating managed funds

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,759
in other words managing other people's

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
money or working for a firm maybe

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,439
working for a prop firm

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,799
and

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
while you may not have a large equity

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
base to start with

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000
um it's not important now

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,119
but what is important is growing your

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
understanding over a long period of time

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,759
and when that means getting experience

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,200
in the marketplace

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
there's no better experience than

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
actually applying the things that you

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
practice in a demo account with positive

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
results and then segwaying into a

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,799
live setting where you're using live

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,000
funds

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
it's not important you have a big

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
account

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,799
because what you're focusing on is the

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
control over drawdown keeping it

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
manageable keeping it tolerable with a

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
tolerable level of drawdown i think i'd

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
say about uh 15

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
annually is a realistic objective um

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
most folks would uh

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,239
would start to cringe over 25 or so um

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,840
but if you can

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
control your draw down to around

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
15 as a maximum that's absolutely

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
amazing uh but 20s it's probably okay

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,800
and if you can still maintain a

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
positive

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,440
outcome for

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
the annual return

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
but

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
thinking about managed funds i want you

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
to think about the

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
possibility that while you may be

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
thinking about only managing your own

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
individual assets and moving your uh

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
your wealth forward

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
independently apart from using anybody

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
else's money

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
for some of you that may not be the case

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,120
maybe

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,879
you came into this mentorship with every

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
expectation of learning to do that very

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,319
thing

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,680
well it starts here you have to have a

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
realistic expectation coming in

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
and knowing that you don't need a whole

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
lot of money

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
if you can show a consistent equity

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
curve that's improving very little

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,840
drawdown very very

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,560
infrequent uh erratic or slow periods in

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,159
your trading uh that is very good for uh

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,680
for investors when they see things like

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
that

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
um and it doesn't have to be high rates

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,840
of return

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
but having a steady increase of over a

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
calendar year

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
that really attracts investors uh

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
there's you have no idea how much money

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
is sitting out there just waiting for

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
people to say hey look you know i'll

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
take that money and control it for you

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,560
and turn a profit

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
now you also don't need to use the

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
entire equity base that you start with

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
um many times ten thousand dollar

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
trading account and they assume that

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
they have to

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
maximize every possible dollar in that

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
account to get a respectable rate of

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,400
return and i don't teach that i actually

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
have a very conservative approach

111
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
when i'm trading

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,599
my view is i don't want to

113
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
allocate every possible dollar

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,120
to the marketplace what i do is i limit

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
my allocation to only 30 of my total

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,160
equity

117
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
that may be shocking to some of you but

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
it's the truth so let's say for instance

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
i have a hundred thousand dollar trading

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
account

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,000
or let's say you have a hypothetical one

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
hundred thousand dollar trading account

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
that means i'm gonna be using thirty

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
thousand dollars to meet whatever margin

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
requirements or trade

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
parameters that i use

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
for that trading

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
in other words if i'm going to be doing

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
a percentage basis of my equity

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
and let's just say for instance that i'm

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
going to be

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
using this standard in the industry of 2

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
that means i'm gonna be using two

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
percent of thirty thousand not two

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
percent

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
of one hundred thousand

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,320
and the reason why that's done is

138
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,759
because i'm never going to have to worry

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,800
about

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
margin calls i'm never going to be over

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
leveraged i'm never going to have

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
uh wild dips in my equity but i can

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,759
still manage to

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
carve out a very nice equity curve even

145
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
just using 30 of my equity

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
investors like to see that they like to

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,199
see that you're not 100 exposed they

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
like to see that

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,520
you know

150
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
having a a good reserve of cash

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
in the account

152
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
that way you always have opportunities

153
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
that you can still take

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
that if they're really too good to pass

155
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
on you have never extended yourself too

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
much and spread yourself too thin so

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
that we always have an opportunity to

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
take something that may otherwise not

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,560
have been

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,400
on your radar screen something comes up

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
in the chart something comes up as a

162
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
an opportunity you always have equity at

163
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
your disposal to take advantage of that

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
that move

165
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
so what you're doing again is you're

166
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
determining your maximum risk exposure

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
and a percentage basis on 30 percent of

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
your equity

169
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,000
so you're really really really drawn

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
down in terms of risk you're not

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,000
maximizing the risk for maximum return

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
you're looking for a very low end risk

173
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,400
exposure

174
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
with the expectation that you're going

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
to have consistently

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,759
pulling in

177
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
percents of return that are respectable

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
over a calendar year

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
again you're ideally set one percent

180
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
as the most risk per trade

181
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
that means

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
one percent of 30 percent of your total

183
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,520
equity base

184
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
okay so you have 10 000

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
in your account

186
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
and you're going to be using 30 of your

187
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
account that means your account

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
trading is going to be based on three

189
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
thousand dollars

190
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
not ten thousand dollars over leveraged

191
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
not looking for the maximum return

192
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,599
you're looking at only using three

193
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
thousand dollars for your trading

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
account to be meeting those margin

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
requirements for your trades

196
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
one percent of that is going to be 30

197
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,240
so 30 is your total maximum risk per

198
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
trade and i already know what some of

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,319
you are thinking michael i can't get

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,840
rich doing this

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
and that's right you're not going to get

202
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
rich

203
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
right now you're not going to get rich

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
tomorrow or next month but you're not

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
thinking like that right now i want you

206
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
to consider and i'm not trying to force

207
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
you into managed funds but i'm trying to

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,039
broaden your perspectives okay on a lot

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,000
of things

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
and allow yourself the opportunity to

211
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
even

212
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
just

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
think about the possibility and again i

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
personally know from experience it's not

215
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,520
fun

216
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
to manage other people's money it's for

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
me it's very stressful

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
but for some of you it may be exactly

219
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
what you'll need to get over that hump

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
and you can make a lot of money managing

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
other people's money rather quickly and

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
then you can take that money and seed

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
your own investing and then you can do

224
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
your own speculation how you'd like to

225
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
do it and if you want to take a little

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,080
bit more risk on not that you should but

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
you can do that in that medium where you

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
get other people's money to pay you

229
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
fill your account up with funds not out

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
of your own pocket you can independently

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
trade apart from other people's money

232
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
and then you can close shop on trading

233
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
other people's money and just focus

234
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,319
primarily on yourself

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
let me target three to one reward to

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
risk or higher setups

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,799
now again some of you are again totally

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,080
completely turned off to actually

239
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
trading a lot higher time frames but

240
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
for some of you this is going to be

241
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
perfectly designed for you it's going to

242
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
be your cup of tea if you will

243
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
there's still three to one setups that

244
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
are offered on these higher time frames

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
charts and that's what you're going to

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
be focusing on

247
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
now having low risk high reward permits

248
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
very very low accuracy

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,839
you don't have to be accurate all the

250
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,959
time

251
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,920
but

252
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,519
you do have to be patient on this time

253
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,839
frame

254
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
and the other benefit is low risk allows

255
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
equity

256
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,279
for more setups

257
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
so numbers you're going to see more

258
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
possible trade setups by not having

259
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
all your money in one trade

260
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
okay expectations

261
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,279
again you want to be focusing on a

262
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,040
hands-on annual percent return now what

263
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,000
is this

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
what's an annual return that's

265
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
respectable

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
um i think

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
18

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
to 25 a year which is like an industry

269
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
standard for managed funds if you could

270
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
do that every single year

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
i can promise you you will never have a

272
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
shortage of people that will want to

273
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
hand you money

274
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
and manage their money for them

275
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
now

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
as we get deeper into this mentorship

277
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
i'll actually tell you how you can

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
well up

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
other people's money

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
and reach out to other people through

281
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,399
different mediums

282
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
and build business

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
relationships with folks that would want

284
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
to do that type of thing

285
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
again it's something that you'll have to

286
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
make the decision on

287
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,519
your own

288
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,399
but

289
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,560
using higher time frame analysis like

290
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
this i want you to go forward from this

291
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
point on

292
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
and contemplate taking long-term trades

293
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
once we complete january's content i

294
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
want you to think about

295
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
operating at least for

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,079
the remainder of this mentorship for

297
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
next eight months or so you want to be

298
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
uh you want to be focused on doing that

299
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
very thing looking for hard time frame

300
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
trades and letting them

301
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
pan out don't try to get in there and

302
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
take a little bit of the marketplace and

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
move to the sidelines real quick

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
and remember

305
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
when you're managing money with higher

306
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
time frame trades

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
there's very little in terms of

308
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
frequency with higher time frame setups

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
so long-term setups form very

310
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
infrequently annually so there's not a

311
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
whole lot of trades throughout the year

312
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
on a hard time frame charts

313
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
when you're trading this higher time

314
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
frame you're going to have to learn to

315
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
allow short term drawdowns in profits

316
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
that means

317
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
that while you're in these long-term

318
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
trades and they pan out because many

319
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
times you're going to see that there's

320
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
going to be retracements

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
that you're going to have to weather

322
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
you're going to sit through several days

323
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
maybe a week or two where the market has

324
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
actually given back some of your open

325
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
profits okay they're not realized

326
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
profits until you close the trade

327
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,360
so by allowing that mindset early on

328
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
saying that okay i know that there's

329
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
going to be

330
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,519
some give and take in these trades

331
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,640
sometimes

332
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,839
over a period of time when you start

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,440
trading larger

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079
this give and take can be rather

335
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,079
large it could be you know emotionally

336
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
charging if you've seen tens of

337
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
thousands of dollars coming in and out

338
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
of your account over the course of

339
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
several weeks if you're not used to that

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
actually makes uh it makes it hard for

341
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
you to think about being objective about

342
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,399
the trade

343
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
so the reason why i also talk about only

344
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
using 30 of your equity getting back to

345
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
that i know some of you probably

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
snickered and said there's no way i'd be

347
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
doing that

348
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
but by having your account only

349
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
allocating 30 towards long-term trades

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,839
that gives you equity and margin to

351
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,399
trade short-term trades so that way

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,600
while we cannot in the u.s trade

353
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
like a hedger in other words we can't

354
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,880
hedge our trades

355
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,240
we can trade markets that are closely

356
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
correlated or inversely correlated

357
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
dollar yen

358
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
if your short position long term

359
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,320
starts to have and you can anticipate

360
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
these types of things when it starts to

361
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,320
have a retracement against your short

362
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,279
position

363
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
you're going to give back some of that

364
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,440
open profit or paper profit before you

365
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
realize it and close it and

366
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,480
move that profit into your account

367
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
that give and take on your p l is going

368
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
to be

369
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
bothersome for some of you most of you

370
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
in fact so the way you can counteract

371
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
that is if you're going to be a

372
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
long-term trader or position trader

373
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
if you're short on dollar yen

374
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
if there's an opportunity for seeing a

375
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
bounce in your short position on dollar

376
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,440
yen you can actually go in

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
and trade the euro dollar

378
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
it's an inverse related pair and you

379
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
would do the opposite

380
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
whatever you're seeing uh retraced in

381
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
the dollar yen you would trade the

382
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
opposite in euro dollar so if you're

383
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,000
getting retracement higher on a short

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
position on dollar yen

385
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
you can actually go short euro dollar or

386
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
maybe british pound dollar

387
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
and capitalize some more money

388
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
in the marketplace while your long-term

389
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
position is in somewhat of a drawdown

390
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
and you're giving back some profits

391
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
you can actually hedge that by trading

392
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
other pairs that are inversely related

393
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
so that's one way you can beat the

394
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,079
north american hedging rule but you just

395
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,760
have to understand simple

396
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
inter-market analysis

397
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,199
which we just covered

398
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,199
in previous lesson

399
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,720
so having

400
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
an understanding that they're going to

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
be a give and take you're going to have

402
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
to have that in the forefront of your

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
mind saying okay either i'm going to

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
trade

405
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
shorter term

406
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
swing trades or short term trades to

407
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
allow myself to

408
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
compensate for the drawdown in open

409
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,720
profits on my long-term trades and then

410
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,680
when that retracement takes shape and

411
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
comes to completion when your long-term

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
trade then it starts to resume

413
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
you're back in there and you've made

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
more money once you get back to that

415
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
old equity high in your long term

416
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
position so you're able to continuously

417
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,399
make more money

418
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,800
and also cover those draw down periods

419
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
on open profits on your long term trades

420
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,519
now stop-loss orders are not a measure

421
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,880
of ability now

422
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
obviously you know most of us in this

423
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
mentorship are predominantly male and

424
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,279
males have a tendency to like to pull

425
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
out the measuring stick

426
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
and see how they measure up against the

427
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
next guy or how they measure up against

428
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
you

429
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
stop loss orders for whatever reason has

430
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,959
over the ages okay of a technical

431
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,000
analysis

432
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
it's become a way of knowing how good

433
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
you are and if you can trade with a

434
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
10-pip stop-loss you must be elite

435
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
that doesn't belong in any way shape or

436
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
form in long-term trading

437
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
long-term trading

438
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
it's not it's you don't limit your your

439
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
trade idea or opportunity based on a set

440
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
number of pips like intraday trading i

441
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
like to have about 35 maximum that's

442
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
about a safe safe number for me

443
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
30 pips is a general rule of thumb but

444
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,639
about 35 pips is about

445
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
the number one go-to number for me

446
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,199
because generally if it's 100

447
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
pip daily range average adr

448
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
not that everyone is or that it

449
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,199
maintains 100 average

450
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,480
but

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,839
a third of that would be 33 so i rounded

452
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
to 35 pips and that gives me a a real

453
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
good round number to go for

454
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
but you can use what i've always said

455
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,480
before about 30 pips

456
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
but on long term trades uh 30 pips just

457
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
isn't going to do it sometimes

458
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
especially if you're only trading off up

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
and keying off of the daily time frame

460
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
so if your daily chart is your

461
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,839
executable time frame which is what

462
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,680
you'd be using if you're trading with a

463
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
monthly and weekly chart and you can't

464
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
use intraday charting because of your

465
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
business or your your home life doesn't

466
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,880
permit you to be up or in front of the

467
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,639
charts or you just have a job i mean

468
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
let's just face it some of you in here

469
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
they have jobs and there's nothing wrong

470
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,600
with that i came from a world where i

471
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
had to go to work too but

472
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,600
you have to understand that your stops

473
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,199
are going to have to be

474
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
proportionate to the time frame you're

475
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,639
trading in

476
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
which leads us to the next point here

477
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
now you know when you're trading a trade

478
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,240
that has a setup that requires a 200 pip

479
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,600
stop loss on it that means you're

480
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
risking 200 pips for some of you that's

481
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
mind-boggling there's no way that you're

482
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
gonna permit yourself to risk 200 pips

483
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,439
of price movement against you

484
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
because you're so used to and ingrained

485
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
in looking at those lower time frames

486
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
but just because it's a 200 pip stop

487
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
loss on a setup on a daily time frame

488
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,119
assume for a moment that you're aiming

489
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,520
for a 600 pip win

490
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
that's still a three to one reward to

491
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,079
risk

492
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,839
ratio there's nothing wrong with that

493
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,079
you're still gearing the same way you

494
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,280
would

495
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,200
you know to be in line with a very low

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
objective in terms of win rate you can

497
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,360
still do very well with that gearing and

498
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,720
obviously that's the minimum so you want

499
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
to be looking for higher

500
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
levels of reward to risk ratios on these

501
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,840
higher time frame charts

502
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,160
okay and then another thing you want to

503
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
think about when you're managing your

504
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
money trading with these higher time

505
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
frames is

506
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
resist the impulse to move your stop

507
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
loss to break even or even reducing the

508
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,120
risk

509
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
on a lot higher time frame long-term

510
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
position trading you're going to have to

511
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
suppress that desire to reduce risk

512
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
right away

513
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
position trading requires a great deal

514
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
of patience and unfortunately there's no

515
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
way of forming that for most of you you

516
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,919
either have it or you grind it out and

517
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,679
you develop it over a long period of

518
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,400
time it just doesn't happen overnight so

519
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
if you don't have a whole lot of time

520
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
to develop patients

521
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,679
position trading is probably not going

522
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,160
to be for you okay and that's one of

523
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,039
those things you're just gonna have to

524
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,120
live with um

525
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
if you need to be in front of the

526
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
markets a little bit more and you're

527
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
trading these lower time frames then

528
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,440
obviously we can move our stop loss

529
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
sooner to break even and lock in profit

530
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
on these lower time frames higher time

531
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
frame just forget that all together

532
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,919
because you want to be waiting

533
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,520
for the market to really be moving a

534
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
significant measure of

535
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
pips before you even consider moving

536
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
that stop loss from the initial point at

537
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,320
which you

538
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,640
enter the trade

539
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
you're gonna have to learn to exit at

540
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
logical targets and

541
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
look to re-enter at a later time

542
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
we can take positions off at logical

543
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
areas of resistance when we're in a

544
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
long-term trend

545
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
and instead of sitting through a measure

546
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
of draw down on our p l what we would be

547
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,080
doing is actually exiting the position

548
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
or maybe some of the position and we'll

549
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
talk about this when we go into trade

550
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,960
management we're actually going to

551
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
specifics this teaching here is just to

552
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
get your mind thinking about some of the

553
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
things that's going to plague you as a

554
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
long-term position trader

555
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
but you know if you're looking at a

556
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
long-term trade and you're bullish on

557
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,400
for instance the dollar yen

558
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,679
and you get to a level where you would

559
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
reasonably in with high probability

560
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
expect some resistance or some

561
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
retracement um

562
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
you may take some of your position off

563
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
you may take half your position off you

564
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
may take three quarters your position

565
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,919
off a third of your position off you

566
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
know uh you know one quarter of your uh

567
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
position off

568
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
and allow that to you know

569
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
be in your account as a profit and then

570
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
once it retraces back to a level where

571
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
it would be logically timed to see

572
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
another uh move higher in your long-term

573
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,080
trade then you can add back that

574
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,039
position or maybe a little bit more than

575
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
what you profited

576
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
when you can't when you took off a

577
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
quarter maybe you'll put back on

578
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,400
a third maybe you'll put back on um

579
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,320
a little bit more than a quarter okay or

580
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
you'll just put back that original

581
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
quarter you you took off

582
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
for some partial profits and then you

583
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
can add it back and you can get a larger

584
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,039
position built on

585
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,360
and see that next lake price

586
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,039
higher where you would make more money

587
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,080
than you would have if you just would

588
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,840
have kept the original gearing and entry

589
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
point at the

590
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
point of entry

591
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
and finally long term is not get rich

592
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,280
quick but get rich steady

593
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,559
so before you go into

594
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
the next series of teachings

595
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,039
and where we actually go into a little

596
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,559
more detail about what it is you're

597
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
actually doing with long-term position

598
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,799
trading

599
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
just know that

600
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
you are not going to see velocity

601
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,520
for your money trading these higher time

602
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
frames it just isn't there now velocity

603
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,919
is how fast you put your money at work

604
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,200
and it makes a profit for you and you

605
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
get it right back right away that's

606
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
velocity that's why i like day trading

607
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
because i can compound my money very

608
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,840
quickly

609
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
some of you cannot do that and don't

610
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,600
feel that you can't be profitable

611
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
because you can't do that disciplinary

612
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
trading so therefore you can't be

613
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
profitable that's not true

614
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
you can make very very handsome returns

615
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,159
on just long-term position trading

616
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,360
but it has to fit your psyche it has to

617
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,159
fit your in inner trader that person

618
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
inside you that makes who you are as a

619
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,400
trader it has to

620
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
fit that that criteria of that inner

621
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
person because if it's at odds with your

622
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
thinking process

623
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
you can't no matter how you slice it

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
it's going to be at odds with you you're

625
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,600
not going to be able to sit through the

626
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
trades you're going to force things

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
because you're impatiently waiting for

628
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,799
something to come to fruition

629
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,880
and it's just going to be a problem so

630
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
the money management aspect will become

631
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
harder for you

632
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,400
if you can't get yourself in alignment

633
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
but every one of you in the mentorship

634
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
should be trying to apply long-term

635
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
position trading

636
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
to some degree

637
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
for the remaining portion of this

638
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,559
mentorship

639
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,159
and you'll see how you don't really need

640
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,760
a whole lot of

641
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,919
skill in terms of entry technique okay

642
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,039
the entry technique you're actually

643
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
going to learn is rather simplistic

644
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
and some of you will practice probably

645
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
start using it a lot more frequent than

646
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,440
i do if i was long-term position trading

647
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
but for long-term position trading this

648
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,559
you know it's the style

649
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,520
of entry that i use and when we get into

650
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
all the entry techniques and concepts

651
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,960
you'll learn it there

652
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,120
but

653
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
before we get into trade entry and stop

654
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,559
loss orders and you know how much money

655
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
should i risk and all that business

656
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,559
you have to have some broad brush ideas

657
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,039
about money management and

658
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
that was the core

659
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,240
point of this teaching because i want

660
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
you to have the mindset going into it

661
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,280
with

662
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
yes you're managing money no it's not

663
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
going to be a whole lot of trades it's

664
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
not going to allow you to parlay that

665
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
account quickly and it's a pretty common

666
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
sense but

667
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
some of you are so new and you're

668
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,360
naive to the fact that these time frames

669
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
require a great deal time

670
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,799
and by having that submission to time

671
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,000
it will allow you to number one improve

672
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
your overall analysis because what you

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,679
see on these higher time frames

674
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,520
that's what directs the lower time frame

675
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,480
to move as they do

676
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
but your objective if you're going to be

677
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,679
a managed fund trader and you're going

678
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
to be trading other people's money

679
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
opm as they call it other people's money

680
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,039
that uh

681
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,280
that career is very lucrative

682
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
especially if you are consistent with

683
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
your rate of return and if you can

684
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
consistently pull 20 or 25

685
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,520
every single year

686
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,799
and you're only doing a handful of

687
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,200
trades now think about this

688
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
we've already mentioned that there's

689
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
very little trades going on on this

690
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,320
higher time frame so if you have every

691
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,919
three months there's a there's a

692
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,240
potential trade that could theoretically

693
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
form every three months it doesn't work

694
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
like that though folks

695
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,880
i would i look personally for two and if

696
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
i'm lucky three

697
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,200
good position trade setups a year

698
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
so that means over the course of january

699
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
to the end of december you're probably

700
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,559
going to see two very s very simple easy

701
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,840
to find long-term trade setups

702
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
maybe if you're lucky and you're really

703
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
dialed in and the market's really

704
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,039
working well and it's very symmetrical

705
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
you may see a third set up for the year

706
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,919
generally

707
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,880
rarely have i seen four setups in in a

708
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
full january december where i've

709
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
actually been able to participate in it

710
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,640
so

711
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
unless you get you know to the degree

712
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
where you know you're able to see it

713
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,120
better than i and it's the goal here

714
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
also you want to be better than ict

715
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
and also the market

716
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
profile for that calendar year is just

717
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
so

718
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
conducive for a

719
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
four move

720
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
set up where you have every three months

721
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
or so you have a quarterly shift

722
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,799
that would be

723
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,600
you know

724
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
that that'd be great for you but just

725
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,279
know going in the expectation should be

726
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,960
it's not going to most likely be there

727
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
for you okay so we're focusing primarily

728
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
on two really good setups a year and

729
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
really milking those positions and if

730
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
we're lucky we'll get a third okay and

731
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,360
you're probably doing the math on this

732
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,440
and thinking okay well if i just did

733
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
three to one and i'm risking one percent

734
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
the best i can make is

735
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,520
three percent on each one

736
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,480
okay grant yes i agree and if you get

737
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,279
two

738
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,320
that means you're only making six

739
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
percent right

740
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
that's correct

741
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,200
but you're also only risking one percent

742
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
per trade so that means if you have a

743
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
setup that's

744
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,159
moved into profitability now you have

745
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,440
new equity

746
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
so that equity can be put to work as

747
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
well so on new trade setups and just

748
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,720
because you missed the lowest possible

749
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,679
buy for a long term long position

750
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,039
doesn't mean you can't get into the

751
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,000
position in that long-term trend

752
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
with a long-term mindset

753
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,960
and still make more percent return and

754
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,080
we'll talk about that when we get into

755
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,240
execution and trade management so don't

756
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
think you're just going to make well i

757
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
could only make about um

758
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,559
if there's only two a year and the best

759
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,120
i can make is three percent return that

760
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
means i'm going to make six percent for

761
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
the year that's not attractive michael

762
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,520
that's only if you're taking one setup

763
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
now if you take

764
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
two trades

765
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
and your maximum exposure is going to be

766
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,440
at two percent and you change the rules

767
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,880
here then obviously that gives you a

768
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
little bit more leeway but

769
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,559
it's not

770
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
it's not meant for you to go in trying

771
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
to maximize how much you can earn what

772
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,600
your goal is is how much can you

773
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
manage

774
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
in terms of

775
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,880
drawdown keeping it low

776
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,720
and still carve out a rate of return

777
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
over the full calendar year

778
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
that's the goal that's the homework for

779
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
the rest of this mentorship you want to

780
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,279
have

781
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,640
at least

782
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
one long-term trade where you were able

783
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
to execute on

784
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,919
and hold it through a long period of

785
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,080
time at least three months so if you can

786
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,120
do that

787
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
you'll have what it is what i personally

788
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
believe that it takes to take put it to

789
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
work where you can turn a profit over a

790
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,200
whole calendar year now if you're going

791
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,279
to manage other people's money

792
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,240
okay and you become better at your

793
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,080
trading you understand what you're doing

794
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,440
and you're risking two percent of thirty

795
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,240
percent of the total equity

796
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,039
if you make two percent

797
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,279
your total maximum risk

798
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,039
per trade

799
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,640
and you have

800
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
several

801
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
opportunities throughout the year where

802
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
you can take the position then you

803
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
should short term trade or swing trade

804
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
any drawdown periods you can maximize

805
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
that you can very easily get to that 18

806
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,039
to 20 rated return on equity for the

807
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,279
year

808
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
you're not going to be doing a whole lot

809
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
of trades you won't be forced to be in

810
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,120
front of the marketplace every single

811
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
trading day

812
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
you're actually going to be very

813
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,279
free with your personal time

814
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
that's the reason why large fund

815
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
managers are always on vacation

816
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,760
they're always doing that because

817
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
they're not trading every single day the

818
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
idea is that you want to put other

819
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,520
people's money at work for you

820
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,440
but under the guys that you're doing it

821
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,679
they're you're doing them a favor rather

822
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,039
but really what you're doing is you're

823
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,520
trying to do as very little as possible

824
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,039
because you the more times you take a

825
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
trade with other people's money

826
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
the more times you're exposing them to

827
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
risk

828
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,880
when you expose a client to risk enough

829
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
times eventually that risk will grow

830
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,039
teeth and bite you

831
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,720
now you're going to feel it emotionally

832
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,039
and psychologically and monetarily

833
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,559
the client is going to feel it

834
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,720
monetarily and they're going to be mad

835
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,919
they're going to be upset especially if

836
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,279
that drawdown continues for a long

837
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,919
period of time it eats and erodes into

838
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
what their equity base was when they

839
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
allowed it to you

840
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,120
so if

841
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
you can keep your frequency low and

842
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,880
focus on very

843
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
high odds potential setups and keep the

844
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
risk light

845
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
and carve out that rate of return 18 to

846
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
20 percent per year

847
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,399
people will dog pile on you throwing new

848
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,679
money at you

849
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,559
and as you have a management fee

850
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,679
all the

851
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,799
percentage

852
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,480
bonuses that you would establish and set

853
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,000
up when you make your prospectus and you

854
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,360
sit down with clients

855
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,960
all those things

856
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
are in your favor

857
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,480
the client would be making money too

858
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
obviously as a result

859
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,799
but you're not working yourself too hard

860
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,120
to get that that money for them

861
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,559
and therefore because it's going to be a

862
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,120
large degree of money hopefully a pooled

863
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
account where you're having other people

864
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,399
pull money into it not just you and one

865
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,279
client you want to work with a fund

866
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
level that has a ability to bring other

867
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,799
people's money in and when you do that

868
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,520
it builds that equity base a lot larger

869
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
so that way if you're making a 25 rate

870
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,399
of return on say 10 million dollars now

871
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,080
we're talking of something about a

872
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,679
little bit more significant and then if

873
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,960
you have a two percent management fee on

874
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,480
top of that

875
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,600
you're getting two percent management

876
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
fee regardless of what you make and then

877
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,679
you get a performance bonus that you

878
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,960
would set up

879
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
all that goes into your pocket so yes

880
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,679
in your mind you're probably thinking i

881
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,520
want to push it to the limit and get a

882
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,399
better performance incentive you know in

883
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,000
terms of paying myself

884
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
but that's not what your goal should be

885
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,520
you should be having a steady eddy

886
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
approach

887
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
only aiming for that easy low hanging

888
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
fruit the clients will absolutely love

889
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
you they're going to talk about their

890
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,320
their their fund manager you every time

891
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
they go out they're all going to be

892
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
asking you know who is he can you can

893
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
you talk to him for me and new funds

894
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
will always find their way to you

895
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,200
so your account

896
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,799
that you manage would continuously be

897
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
growing

898
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,799
allowing new funds to you come in and

899
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,039
that just by default keeps pushing your

900
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,679
pay every single time this happens your

901
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
pay goes up

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,440
so it's not about how much money you

903
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
have right now

904
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,279
it's how you can manage money

905
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,159
right now and going forward and the goal

906
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,360
is not to see a lot of drawdown drawdown

907
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,320
happens by way of a lot of action

908
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,919
because no matter what it's a numbers

909
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
game you can be good all day long okay

910
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
but you if you play the game enough you

911
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,880
get up the bat

912
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,120
enough times you're going to strike out

913
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,559
when you deal with other people's money

914
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
and you're managing that money you do

915
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
not want to have a big long drawn out

916
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,760
strikeout period you don't want that

917
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
they want to see

918
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,399
consistency and if you're consistently

919
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,039
infrequent with risk exposure

920
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,799
but you're showing rate of return that's

921
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
handsome over the calendar year they

922
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
will love you

923
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,000
and love in the form of managed funds is

924
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
money

925
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
lots of money it comes by way of new

926
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
funds they put more money into your

927
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,120
hands because they've seen that you've

928
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
proven yourself

929
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,159
a lot of folks will test you out and

930
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,279
i'll put a small amount of money okay

931
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,960
i'll see what you do with this and if

932
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,399
you show consistency and a rate of

933
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,440
return it's

934
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,240
very

935
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,799
sobering and it's not over the top

936
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,720
you're not trying to swing for fences

937
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
managing this money

938
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,360
okay will invite and by default

939
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
other money to come in by either the

940
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,799
client you already have or clients that

941
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,760
you have

942
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,360
and by their word of mouth because they

943
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
will invariably talk about what you're

944
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,000
doing for them

945
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
new money

946
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
is very talkative

947
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,519
it dislikes the chatter so when it talks

948
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,640
to other potential clients they by

949
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
default will reach out to you and you

950
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
will see your your fund management

951
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,799
business grow

952
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,000
and that just puts more money in your

953
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,159
pocket and again nothing changes just

954
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,760
because there's more money coming in and

955
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,919
you're managing you don't want to change

956
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,399
the idea of what you do about your

957
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,840
trading you're not trying to impress

958
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,279
anyone you've already made the

959
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,799
impression that this is the rate of

960
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,559
return you're aiming for there's no

961
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,000
guarantee you're going to get it but are

962
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,039
they going to be mad if you made 16

963
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,640
no way they're not going to complain

964
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,279
about that if they made 16 on their

965
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,480
money

966
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,880
and they had very little period of

967
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,559
drawdown where they didn't have any real

968
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,240
exposure to risk

969
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,279
but

970
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,480
they had 16 rate of return 16 return on

971
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,039
10 million dollars is respectable

972
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,640
you can't find that rate of return

973
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,919
anywhere in the marketplace right now

974
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,279
they don't get it in cds they don't get

975
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,120
it in equities they're not getting it in

976
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,480
you know money markets or anything like

977
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,919
that so

978
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,279
what they're doing

979
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,360
is they're allowing you to work for them

980
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,039
by managing that money

981
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
well in their eyes you're working really

982
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
hard

983
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,159
and when you're managing money you don't

984
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,159
want to be working hard you want to be

985
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
working smart and smart means you're not

986
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
doing a whole lot of work to make that

987
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
money you only want to put it at risk

988
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
when it's very favorable and you'll see

989
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,480
when we get into the execution stage and

990
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,360
the

991
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,200
management stage of long-term trading

992
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
you'll see this it takes very little to

993
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,120
do very well on these higher time frames

994
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,879
until next time wish you good luck and

995
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,839
good trading
