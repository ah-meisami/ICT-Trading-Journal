1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,619
welcome back folks this is lesson 4.3 of

2
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,720
the January 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,300
continuing our discussion on seasonal

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,199
Tendencies we're going to be

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,180
highlighting ideal seasonal Tendencies

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,340
and higher time frame analysis this is

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,599
going to be specifically dealing with

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,460
foreign exchange or FX payers

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,559
okay before we begin uh just a reminder

10
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,559
that seasonal Tendencies are a tendency

11
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,780
they're not a Panacea they're not a be

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,420
all in all they're not a absolution

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,579
they're just road maps of what has

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,520
happened in the past with price action

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,100
so when we look at these charts the

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,079
orientation is for instance for the

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,899
Forex pair all the dollar the chart on

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,120
the left is the Australian dollar

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,459
Futures price seasonal tendency

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,380
and the chart on the right US dollar

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,420
Index seasonal tendency for the Futures

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,760
price what I'm sharing with you the

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,380
ideal seasonal Tendencies what we're

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,720
actually looking at is we're comparing

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,119
the two seasonal tendency charts we're

26
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,560
looking for the most diametrically

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,540
opposed price action between the two so

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,640
when we're focusing on high probability

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,159
or in my definition an ideal seasonal

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,259
tendency is when the underlying Market

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,080
is predisposed to go in a direction that

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,119
c Zone tenancy is being outlined in here

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,979
so it doesn't mean every single year the

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,600
seasonal tendency May

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
may not come to fruition but that's okay

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
it's a general rule of thumb there's

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
plenty of these seasonal Tendencies as

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,939
we go through the major pairs so there's

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,320
something always every year that would

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,180
set up a potential long-term trade

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
you see here on the Australian dollar

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,840
the strongest seasonal tenancy in

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,180
contrast to that of the dollar Index on

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,140
the right

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,759
the Shaded in area here shows the

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
strongest tendency for Australian dollar

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,420
Futures prices to Rally in March and

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,899
make a top sometime in May

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,500
now if this is true we should see a

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,080
sell-off in the dollar Index and we do

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,959
in fact see that same thing occurring

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,420
between March and a decline making a low

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,239
in May so between the two we have a

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
qualified ideal scenario for the

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,840
Australian US dollar pair in FX to Rally

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,000
because it's the first currency in the

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,340
name of the pair Australian dollar

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,660
Aussie looks at the rally at time of

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,520
year same time the dollar Index so the

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,519
pair Construction in ways design when we

61
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,040
watch price of Aussie dollar when we see

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,379
price rallying on that chart we're

63
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,540
actually seeing the rise of Australian

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,400
dollar futures or I'll show you in

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,599
prices

66
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,700
versus lower prices on the dollar Index

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,819
so in an ideal scenario this trade would

68
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,700
be best suited to be found on a

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
long-term primary bullish Market or if

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,840
we made a long-term low

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,360
we could potentially test this theory in

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,860
terms of catching a long-term trade

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,879
okay our next pair we're going to look

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,819
at is the New Zealand dollar or kiwi

75
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,519
coupled with the dollar Index on the

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,900
left hand side that's the New Zealand

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,300
dollar Futures Contract seasonal

78
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,260
tendency

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,120
and again on the right hand side it is

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,340
the US dollar Index features seasonal

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,900
tendency

82
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,300
see here again just like we saw in the

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,640
Australian dollar we can see a rally

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,459
that's typical for a March April time

85
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,340
period making a high in May for the New

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,440
Zealand dollar Futures price and again

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,700
if this is true we're going to see a

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,379
contrasting sell-off at the same time of

89
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,200
the year again we do see that May April

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,379
High and a low forming in May

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,200
now these are only focusing on the

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,840
highest ideal

93
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,640
long-term setup I'm not looking for

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,379
every possible scenario for a seasonal

95
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,019
play but for long-term analysis we're

96
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,299
focusing only on the most obvious ones

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,580
that jump off the chart and they have

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,620
historical data to support it and again

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,959
because it's a tendency it doesn't mean

100
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,040
it's going to happen every single year

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,720
so the best scenario would be when

102
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,940
you're in a bullish condition and you're

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,978
seeing underlying bullishness for a New

104
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,139
Zealand dollar this seasonal tendency

105
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,680
should have an effect on price that time

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,660
of year between March and April we

107
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,240
should be seeing a seasonal low and for

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
a couple months you see a rally up into

109
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
around May

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
the next pair we're going to look at is

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
the euro dollar or Fiber

112
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,080
and we're going to be focusing on the

113
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,639
left-hand chart for the Euro Futures

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,020
price and then we're going to look at

115
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,580
the chart on the right

116
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,740
for the Futures price on the US dollar

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,120
Index

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
as you see here we have a seasonal load

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,259
it usually forms between June and July

120
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,479
and that should be seen with a high that

121
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,639
forms in the dollar Index so as a

122
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,639
long-term High time frame scenario this

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,440
is the ideal scenario you would look for

124
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,259
a load of form in the summer of euro

125
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,380
dollar

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,540
okay next one we're looking at is the

127
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,979
cable or British pound versus US dollar

128
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,780
the chart on the left is the British

129
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,820
pound Futures price and seasonal

130
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,780
tendency

131
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,880
and the dollar Index is on the right

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
hand side seasonal tendency for the

133
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Futures price as well

134
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,180
for the British pound we have the

135
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,280
strongest tendency to make a low

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,259
in March with a high forming in May and

137
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,820
if this is true

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,800
we would be seeing a high form between

139
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
March and April with a low forming in

140
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,820
May and we do see that here so this is

141
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,100
the highest probable or ideal scenario

142
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,199
for seasonal Tendencies again not a

143
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,380
Panacea or a BL Indo but it is a really

144
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,800
good time to expect a bullish scenario

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,039
at least for a long-term trade if the

146
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,720
underlying market for the British pound

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,699
is bullish so if you're studying the

148
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,620
Futures price of the British pound or if

149
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
you're just watching the pound dollar FX

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,180
pair and on the higher time frame charts

151
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,740
we're expecting to see higher prices

152
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,080
were in the long-term uptrend if we

153
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,880
enter this time of year between March

154
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,440
and April we would be expecting some

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,940
seasonal low to form

156
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,580
and we can see that actually is

157
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
supported with Ace sell-off in the

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,340
dollar

159
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,220
seasonally as well

160
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,039
I want to contrast also the difference

161
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,280
between these blue and red lines on the

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,139
chart on the left hand side that's the

163
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,360
British pounds Futures seasonal tendency

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,180
the Blue Line represents 40 Years of

165
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,319
data

166
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,100
and the red line represents 15 years of

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,360
data

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,840
so by contrasting that you have a lot of

169
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,639
time factored into these tendencies so

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,740
it's to me in my opinion this is a

171
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,539
really strong one because it's many

172
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,580
years worth of data and it's also

173
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,500
contrasting it with a smaller short-term

174
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,720
view of the marketplace where in the

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,060
last 15 years it was there and in the

176
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,039
last 40 years it was still there so

177
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,080
between March and April there's usually

178
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,060
a seasonal load of the forums and then

179
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,979
it rallies up to making a spring high

180
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,539
around May

181
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,759
and again it's really really uh

182
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,620
positive

183
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,259
and most likely expected to see happen

184
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,720
when you have the underlying British

185
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,900
pound in a strong uptrend or you've

186
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,419
suspected a turn has taken place long

187
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,699
term and we haven't started trending up

188
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,440
higher we can test this Theory by taking

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,020
a trade and see if it does in fact pay

190
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
now

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,300
foreign

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
X pair is the dollar swissy okay or US

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
dollar versus Swiss franc dollar Index

194
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
is on the left hand side it's a seasonal

195
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
tendency for the Futures price of the

196
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,160
dollar Index

197
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,199
and on the right hand side it is the

198
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,020
Futures chart seasonal tendency for the

199
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,940
Swiss francaise so what we have on the

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,440
dollar Index we have a seasonal tendency

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,020
for the dollar to make a seasonal High

202
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,539
in the June July time period so summer

203
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,419
highs forming in dollar Index

204
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,240
and the contrasting low that forms in

205
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,819
June July in the Swiss franc so we have

206
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,440
a strong tendency for that to make a

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,139
major turning point in the summer months

208
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,940
for this particular pair and again this

209
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,879
would be an ideal scenario where the

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
dollar is in a bearish market uh primary

211
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,719
downtrend or if we are in a primary

212
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,179
option for the Swiss franc this will be

213
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,619
a good scenario to trade this as well

214
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,279
okay the dollar versus Japanese Yen

215
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,680
on the left hand side we have again the

216
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,839
seasonal tendency for the Futures price

217
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,820
for the dollar Index

218
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,019
and then on the right we have the

219
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,640
seasonal tenancy chart for the Futures

220
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,040
price of the Japanese Yen

221
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
strongest tendency on the dollar is to

222
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
see a high form and a sell-off into May

223
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,860
and the opposite is seen with a seasonal

224
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,140
low forming in March in April and we see

225
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
that that generally makes the long-term

226
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,779
low

227
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,420
for the Japanese Yen at that time across

228
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,899
the calendar year foreign

229
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,360
if we're looking at seasonal Tendencies

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,660
again the way you could trade this is if

231
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,820
you are in a downtrend for the dollar

232
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,800
Index this would be a really good one to

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
sell

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,959
dollar versus Japanese Yen or if you are

235
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,940
in a bullish uptrend for the Japanese

236
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,660
Yen this is a good time to

237
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,820
sell short this currency pair because

238
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,580
you'd be buying strength of the Japanese

239
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,200
Yen while selling dollars

240
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,720
okay our next pair is the dollar CAD

241
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
or US dollar versus Canadian dollar on

242
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,380
the left-hand side we have the dollar

243
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,620
Index Futures seasonal tendency and on

244
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,700
the right we have Canadian dollar

245
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,680
Futures seasonal tendency

246
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
and for the dollar we have a strong

247
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,700
tendency to create a high again in that

248
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,740
March April time period McNiel low in

249
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,000
May

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,700
and we see the opposite is seen with the

251
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,399
Canadian dollar making a low in March

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
April and that high forming in May so

253
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,779
the way you would use this seasonal

254
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,100
tendency is if you're bearish on the

255
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,720
dollar Index this is a good time to be

256
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,200
selling short dollar CAD or if you're

257
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
long-term bullish on Canadian dollar

258
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,339
this is a good time to sell this pair

259
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,800
because you can see the weakness in the

260
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
dollar Index and the strength underlying

261
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,980
with the Canadian dollar

262
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,620
so I went kind of like go back in

263
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,959
summary with these seasonal tendencies

264
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,120
just because we're looking at one

265
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,920
seasonal tendency for instance when

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,540
we're looking to the season seasonal

267
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,820
Tendencies for the dollar Index uh when

268
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,980
that occurs like for instance between

269
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,079
March and April time period we expect

270
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,420
the dollar Index to create some measure

271
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,600
of a high long term seasonally it

272
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
doesn't mean it's going to happen but

273
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
we're expecting it to occur

274
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,660
by itself it means that if we're

275
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,399
primarily bearish on the dollar Index

276
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,160
this is an ideal scenario to be selling

277
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
dollars

278
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,940
now that may not be apparent in the

279
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,019
dollar Index but if we see a pair or a

280
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,579
currency that is coupled with a dollar

281
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,459
that has a strong seasonal tendency to

282
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,019
Rally in a specific time of the year

283
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,680
like that March April time period like

284
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,820
we're seeing here with the Canadian

285
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,640
dollar that means we don't have to be in

286
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,220
the uptrend for dollar Index we could be

287
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,320
in a long-term consolidation but

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,360
save the save the Canadian dollars in a

289
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,980
bullish uptrend

290
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,579
you're focusing in on that time of year

291
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,860
where March April creates a low in

292
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,079
Canadian dollar and it rise up into May

293
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,940
so with that seasonal tendency

294
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,920
underlying strength for the Canadian

295
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
dollar that also would sell off the

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,220
dollar versus CAD pair so it's a it's a

297
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,839
blending of the ideas it's not simply

298
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,300
well it has to be the uh downtrend for

299
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,920
the dollar and it has to be uptrend for

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,540
the Canadian dollar you only really need

301
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,380
one

302
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,600
and by blending these two elements

303
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
together and applying the seasonal

304
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
tendency you're really focusing in on

305
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
when seasonally the highest probability

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,300
for a big move is to occur you narrow it

307
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,680
down to a specific time of the year

308
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,380
certain calendar months and highest

309
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,240
probability seasonal Tendencies so you

310
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,279
can go through your calendar

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,620
ahead of time and write down certain

312
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,480
months where you want to be focusing on

313
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,820
specific plays that may unfold in price

314
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,800
it's real easy to forget about these

315
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,060
seasonal Tendencies when you get caught

316
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,680
up in the day trading and short-term

317
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
trading and reading other stuff about

318
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,700
ICT material but you want to have this

319
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,139
stuff in your in your calendar on your

320
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,459
trading desk there should always be

321
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,740
things to watch this month things to

322
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,139
watch the coming month okay and these

323
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,100
are the types of things you want to have

324
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,660
in your notes so when you're working at

325
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,160
your desk and you have your your your

326
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,899
trade desk open you're looking for

327
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,940
trades always start your trading day

328
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,700
every single day with reviewing a macro

329
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,000
perspective like this are we coming on a

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,620
time period where there's a high

331
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,040
probability for a sustainable move and

332
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,019
it's seen by these types of seasonal

333
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,540
tendencies very rarely do you have

334
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
things that would line up or give you

335
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,860
clues that feature price should do

336
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,019
certain things or have a rhythm to it

337
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,839
like seasonal Tendencies and when we

338
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,639
study these you're going to see that

339
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,440
we're gonna go we're going to refer to

340
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,940
these actually uh multiple times

341
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,560
throughout the disciplines of trading

342
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
we're going to use them again in swing

343
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,940
trading and in short-term trading so

344
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,680
we're not done with them because we're

345
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,720
doing High time frame analysis but for

346
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,279
higher time frame analysis these are

347
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,019
scenarios you want to be focusing on

348
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,260
specifically for these respective pairs

349
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,360
so until we talk again I wish you good

350
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,740
luck and good Trading
