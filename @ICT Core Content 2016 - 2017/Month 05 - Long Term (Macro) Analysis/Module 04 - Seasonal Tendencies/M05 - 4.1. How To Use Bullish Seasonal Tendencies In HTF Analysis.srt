1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,199
welcome back folks this is lesson 4.1

2
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,660
implementing macro analysis

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,340
we're going to be teaching applying

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,960
seasonal Tendencies to hire time frame

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,439
analysis

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,599
this module is going to be teaching

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,180
bullish seasonals in higher time frame

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,640
analysis

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,140
okay you've probably seen this chart

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,620
before I've made uh available a few of

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,559
these templates over the years but we're

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,660
gonna be teaching specifically only on

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,940
the buy side for seasonal tendencies in

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,920
this teaching

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,600
and we'll be using the Canadian dollar

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,039
to begin with

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,559
and what this is is it's a 40-year

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,739
seasonal tendency where the price on

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,539
polish years and bearish years

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,079
have been compiled and compressed into a

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,440
file where the output gives us a

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,080
tendency for what price usually does for

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,540
each contract delivery month

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,920
I'm going to get into that in a minute

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,439
before we get into it deeper let's bring

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
up some points here seasonal Tendencies

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,460
are merely a proverbial roadmap of past

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,960
performance

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,520
and they are not to be viewed as a

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,220
Panacea or be all end-all concept

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,020
despite what you may see in this

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,240
teaching and the subsequent teaching in

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,439
4.2

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,360
please let me remind you that simply

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,979
because it's done something in the past

36
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,619
doesn't that in any way guarantee it's

37
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,000
going to do the same thing in the future

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
this is just one more tool to add a

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,340
Confluence of things that would already

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,079
lead you to an expectation that the

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,220
market should go higher or lower

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,619
okay folks this is the Canadian dollar

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,479
40-year seasonal tendency this is the

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
expanded view of the same chart you just

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,119
saw

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,680
and I want you to take a look at

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,479
something real quick

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
up here we have it says March

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,939
abbreviation June abbreviation

50
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,680
September's abbreviation December and

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,239
then back to March again

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,120
what this is delineating is the contract

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
delivery months for the Canadian dollar

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,800
now currencies they deliver on March

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,319
June September and December every single

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,680
year these months expire

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,560
these charts that I'm sharing with you

58
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,840
are a compilation of data over all the

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,480
delivery months price action for the

60
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,099
last 40 plus years

61
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,580
beginning in 1976 now this data is only

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,239
compiled up to 2015 but I can tell you

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,180
that the output is hardly changed at all

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,580
if you're concerned about it being 2017

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,379
is there any there is there any

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,660
deviation no there's not any deviation

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,720
at all so how do we look at these things

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,580
and what benefit does it give us well

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,920
let me ask you a question

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,980
if you were to if you were to ask the

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,800
average Trader that just now getting

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
into trading maybe it's not Forex maybe

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,620
it's stocks or or Commodities and you

74
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,060
ask them hey look

75
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,760
if I were to ask you today is the

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,000
markets manipulated to a degree where

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,239
well before Price ever starts to trade a

78
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,920
specific time of year would it be

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,680
inclined to go higher or lower based on

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,540
some underlying influence that repeats

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,659
itself and as a new Trader I could tell

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,800
you I would have never answered that

83
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,060
question with yeah I could probably

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,500
agree to that

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,360
um I it felt like a random thing to me

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,180
and one of the things that I like about

87
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,120
seasonal Tendencies is it gave a

88
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,459
characteristic to price that proved to

89
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,440
me that there is a rhyming reason behind

90
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,720
everything that goes on

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
if there's something that's measured and

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,980
again this is 40 years worth of data

93
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,680
okay 40 years worth of data

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,500
in the blue line the red line is a

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,200
15-year average so you can see between

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,540
looking at 40 years worth of data and 15

97
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,459
years worth of data there's very little

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,560
discrepancy in terms of what the overall

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,080
strong seasonal Tendencies are for this

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,519
particular currency

101
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,319
now since we're primarily dealing with

102
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,420
bullish seasonal tendencies in higher

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,399
time frame analysis for this module

104
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,760
we're going to not focus on bearish

105
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,019
patterns but we're going to be looking

106
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,259
for tendencies that lend well to being a

107
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,340
buyer

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,900
and if we're going to be doing higher

109
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,460
time frame analysis and we want to be

110
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,620
buying on these higher time frame charts

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,479
and using it for ideas for being

112
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,100
position Trader

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,380
looking at this seasonal tendency I'm

114
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,540
going to ask you what

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,820
time of year now time of year is going

116
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,500
to be delineate at the bottom of the

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,820
chart down here you can see it's all

118
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,979
dated here's December November October

119
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,580
this is all calendar month based this is

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
contract delivery months okay you can

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
see the vertical lines delineating when

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
that contract

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,860
March would end trading here that would

124
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,419
be the beginning of June's trading

125
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,340
contract and then June would end here

126
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,380
and it would pick up at September's

127
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,300
contract and so on going through the

128
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,340
season sanity chart

129
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,919
if I were to ask you what would be your

130
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,259
first choice in deciding when would be a

131
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,979
good time to buy

132
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
well if you were

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,139
paying attention you can see that this

134
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,580
is probably a really good time to be

135
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,940
buying around mid-march

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,539
all the way up into the May June time

137
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,800
period

138
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,340
so between March and June there

139
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,699
typically is a strong tendency for the

140
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,639
Canadian dollar to Rally

141
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,039
now some of you may think to yourself

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,600
well that's great you know if this is

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,919
the contract month for Canadian dollar

144
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,060
what does that mean to me if I'm not

145
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,620
really a Futures Trader

146
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
well the main thing is is this is the

147
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,280
seasonal tendency that you would expect

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,740
Canadian dollar Futures to Rally now it

149
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,000
does not mean that it's going to Rally

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,580
every single year march to June doesn't

151
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,259
mean that it just means that there's a

152
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,360
strong probability that historically

153
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,340
looking back over 40 years worth of data

154
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,680
and comparing it against 15 years worth

155
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,039
of data there is a strong underlying

156
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,039
well there I say it element of Truth to

157
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,960
the fact that there is a tendency for

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,699
this to Rally problem is

159
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,039
if you're not a Futures Contract Trader

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,259
this doesn't do anything for you

161
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,259
or does it if we are trading foreign

162
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,900
exchange we have to remember that the

163
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,340
Canadian dollar is paired with the

164
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
dollar Index

165
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,000
now the dollar Index is the first in in

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,979
the pair's name so that means if we're

167
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,639
bearish one Canadian dollar the U.S CAD

168
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,080
is going to go

169
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,780
up if we're bullish on Canadian dollar

170
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,479
that means the U.S CAD pair is going to

171
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,800
go down

172
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,259
that means Canadian Dollars are bullish

173
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,120
while that would suppress the U.S dollar

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,139
Index

175
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,300
so since the pair's name begins with U.S

176
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,199
dollar

177
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,479
opposite would be seen in what we expect

178
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,199
to see in the Futures Contract so

179
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,300
what we have to do is focus in on a

180
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,500
seasonal tendency on the Futures

181
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,680
Contract that shows us a bearish tone in

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,699
the marketplace

183
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,660
so you can see we're here between

184
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,699
September and around Christmas time in

185
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,440
December there typically is a strong

186
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,639
tendency

187
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,599
for the Canadian dollar to decline on

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,380
in the underlying Futures Contract so we

189
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,580
have to take this into account when

190
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,840
we're looking at foreign exchange

191
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
because the U.S CAD pair is an inversion

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,340
of what the Futures Contract shows for

193
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,319
Canadian dollar Futures price

194
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,419
so if there's a strong tenancy for

195
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,639
September October November and December

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,539
to have a decline in the Canadian dollar

197
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,660
that should be a bullish scenario for

198
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,099
U.S CAD

199
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,860
let's take this over to the charts and

200
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,199
see if this in fact has any validity to

201
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,319
it

202
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,620
okay we're focusing on the bullish

203
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,720
seasonal Tendencies we have our U.S CAD

204
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,060
chart this is a weekly chart and I went

205
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,240
back to 2008

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,099
just to give you a nice sample size of

207
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,539
data and I started the line at the

208
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,060
beginning of September and I carried it

209
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,599
out in time to about midpoint of

210
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,580
December

211
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,099
you can see that shaded area all the way

212
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,740
to the left here

213
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,660
this is when we'd expect to see the

214
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,520
Canadian dollar

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
to be bearish

216
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,419
on the Futures underlying contract price

217
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,520
but because we're foreign exchange

218
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,039
Traders we have to be looking at it to

219
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,020
be reversed or inverted so that means it

220
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
would be bullish for the U.S CAD pair

221
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,020
because this is how we're trading the

222
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,959
major U.S against the cad

223
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,580
so this is the buying opportunity that

224
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,140
would be presented and look at the look

225
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,019
at the performance here on us CAD

226
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,300
as a relationship to the seasonal

227
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,920
tendency look how strong that buy was

228
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,620
look how many Pips it moved notice also

229
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,640
in here

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,740
this is the next time period very next

231
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,459
year

232
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,920
in 2009

233
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,899
this is a time when the season 10 should

234
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,540
should take place and that means the

235
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,920
Canadian dollar should be bearish on the

236
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,480
underlying Futures Contract but that

237
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,060
would be an inversion on U.S CAD pairs

238
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,380
that means we would expect bullishness

239
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,240
in here now while we didn't press up to

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,620
make new higher highs there was a nice

241
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
little pop nice little rally in here but

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
overall the direction was down so you

243
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,899
can see how the season tendency really

244
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,480
wasn't much help in terms of seeing much

245
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
like this

246
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
higher prices

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,260
very next year same thing very weak it

248
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,600
was lower now I'm going to ask you a

249
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,940
question look at these last two years

250
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,380
what was the underlying price Direction

251
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,899
on the weekly chart was it bullish or

252
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,120
bearish

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,220
bearish has been going lower

254
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,160
so would you be focusing on buying that

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,240
time of year

256
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,279
versus looking for opportunity to be a

257
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,540
seller

258
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,700
there's a hint for the next tutorial

259
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,160
4.2

260
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,860
going to 2011 we can see that the

261
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,000
seasonal tendency had a really nice

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
effect here after we made a nice low and

263
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,320
Market structures shifted to the bullish

264
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,339
side

265
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,860
and station overflow is now bullish and

266
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,300
during a time of year when the

267
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,160
underlying Futures Contract for Canadian

268
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,980
prices should be going lower

269
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,500
that's bullish for U.S CAD so for a

270
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,360
foreign exchange Trader we're looking

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
for buys we had to look for weakness in

272
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,600
the online Futures Contract of the

273
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
Canadian dollar that would Propel price

274
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,980
higher at a time of the year when we

275
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,200
would expect prices to come in

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
same thing here the very next year 2012

277
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,360
we can see price again rallied up during

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,160
this time of the year

279
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,380
and now we're still bullish now look at

280
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,000
the effects of the seasonal tenancy

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
again we have a low and it starts

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,779
rallying up again

283
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,899
again same time of year September to

284
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,000
almost Christmas seasonal tendency

285
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,620
rallies again

286
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,220
same time period here rallies again and

287
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,399
again 2016 just passed we have a nice

288
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,959
rally up here as well seasonal tendency

289
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
come again once again strong now looking

290
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,579
at this again let me remind you what

291
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,920
we're looking at is underlying weakness

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,500
in the Futures Contract so if it's

293
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,940
underlying weakness in the Futures

294
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,800
Contract for a Canadian dollar the

295
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,140
inversion puts it to a bullish stance

296
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,700
for U.S CAD

297
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,380
so it's very important that's why I

298
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,660
taught this one specifically because I'm

299
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,220
showing you how we have to take the

300
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,300
seasonal tendency from the Futures

301
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,680
Contract for some of the majors that are

302
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,820
appeared with a dollar

303
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,920
their currencies start with U.S CAD so

304
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
it's going to be an inversion so what

305
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
you would expect to see in the Futures

306
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,959
Contract has to be reversed in some of

307
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,459
the currencies that are paired out with

308
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,680
the dollar

309
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,180
so now

310
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,120
by itself it doesn't mean anything but a

311
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,519
coupled with other things

312
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,920
like quarterly shifts

313
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,480
remember that

314
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
every three or four months there's going

315
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
to be a move on a hard time frame

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,839
now we're adding another dimension to

317
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,620
that

318
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,540
it's one thing they expect to move every

319
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,180
three to four months but where is that

320
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,800
move going what what should we be

321
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,660
focusing on should we be buying or

322
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,060
should we be selling

323
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,399
seasonal Tendencies give us a road map

324
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,700
to help build the idea that okay there's

325
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,920
certain quarters of the year that we

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,540
want to be a buyer and there's certain

327
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,339
quarters of the year that we want to be

328
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,420
a seller

329
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,180
and we anticipate this year in and year

330
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,459
out the only difference is is we're

331
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,779
going to be looking for markets that

332
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,000
already predisposed to go higher and

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,399
then coupling that with the bullishness

334
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,100
of seasonal tendencies

335
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,899
if we're looking at the Canadian dollar

336
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,600
we'd have to reverse it look for

337
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,399
weakness in the seasonal Tendencies on

338
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,620
the underlying creatures contract and

339
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,360
then apply it to the U.S cat as

340
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,160
bullishness because it's an inversion of

341
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,839
Futures Contract prices for Canadian

342
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,700
dollar

343
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,620
if we see times when the Canadian dollar

344
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,639
is bullish underlying U.S CAD payer and

345
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,620
this seasonal tenancy September to

346
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,360
almost Christmas every single year

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,180
there's a strong tendency for it to be

348
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,579
bullish between that time period that

349
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,740
means there's many weeks where you can

350
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,060
be a bullish

351
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,200
U.S CAD Trader if the underlying pair of

352
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,899
us cat is bullish this is going back

353
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,700
several years and I only gave you this

354
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,680
sample size because if I'll give you any

355
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,959
more data it'll ruin all the discoveries

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,519
if you go back and study for yourself

357
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,760
but you can see here clearly many

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
instances when the underlying Market

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,100
moves are in line with the macro trend

360
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
seasonal Tendencies are absolutely a

361
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,139
barn burner for delivering what you

362
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,579
should be doing for each quarter of the

363
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,920
year in this case you have a loaded deal

364
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,260
if you're looking for a buying

365
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,480
opportunity for us CAD it's between

366
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,760
September and getting close to Christmas

367
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,440
every single year when the Market's

368
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
predisposed to go higher

369
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,860
what quarterly shift are you gonna be

370
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,420
looking for now

371
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,500
looking for longs

372
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,399
okay so now we're going to look at a

373
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,779
market that's closely related to

374
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,399
Canadian dollar

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,860
its number one export is crude oil

376
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,200
and here we have another example

377
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,440
just as a supporting idea

378
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,240
if he looked at this Market over here

379
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,519
you would expect to see bullish prices

380
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,339
for a rally in the crude oil market and

381
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,040
that rally comes in around coming in

382
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,860
about mid February going into March and

383
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,620
carrying into May June time period

384
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,680
so we're expecting bullishness in the

385
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,839
crude oil market and since

386
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,940
Canadian dollar generally moves almost

387
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,060
in tandem with a little the strong

388
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,120
tendency for the Canadian dollar the

389
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,019
rally

390
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,660
and the crude oil Market to rally at

391
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,380
this time of year that means we have a

392
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,320
march to June basically a

393
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,500
bullish effect for Canadian dollar and

394
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
crude oil coupled together so that's a

395
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,740
strong tendency

396
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,380
but again because we're looking at

397
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,779
Canadian dollar in the Foreign Exchange

398
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,959
Market this would have to be reversed

399
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,560
so we'll save that study for you in

400
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,519
addition to what's already been

401
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,720
presented here but I want to show you

402
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,959
the Futures Contract price for crude oil

403
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,860
between around March to June time period

404
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,279
okay here's the crude oil markets the

405
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,199
weekly chart and I just went back to

406
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,579
January uh 14 2014.

407
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,139
and obviously you can see here's this is

408
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,120
a bearish market here it's been in a

409
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,680
long-term downtrend when the collapse of

410
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,440
the oil Market from around the 105 level

411
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
but let's take a look at the bullishness

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,680
of that seasonal tendency again looking

413
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,100
for that march to June time period

414
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,440
okay so here's March all the way through

415
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,560
to June you can see the rally in the

416
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,240
crude oil Market

417
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,519
rate when it made its high and

418
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,160
the 2014 time period

419
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,620
and the next year we'd be looking for

420
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,899
the same seasonal tendency between March

421
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,579
and June all the way up into the first

422
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,779
of July

423
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,880
we can see it again here rallies once

424
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,980
more even in a bear Market it's still

425
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,240
there

426
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,160
we don't force the trades but I'm just

427
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,660
showing you the seasonal tendency that's

428
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,940
existing in the marketplace that should

429
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,920
convince you that there is an absolute

430
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
program to everything that goes on

431
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,680
despite fly-in domain factors there are

432
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,199
very routine things that take place and

433
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,820
they repeat themselves over and over

434
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,199
again

435
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,260
and again in 2016 we have March 2 the

436
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,120
1st of July encompassing the whole month

437
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,459
of June you can see that rally again

438
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,920
comes in for crude oil now my question

439
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,139
to you is this if you can see these

440
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,699
opportunities

441
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,339
repeating themselves based on the data

442
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,959
that I'm sharing with these reports and

443
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,720
seasonal tendency charts

444
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
is it hard not to feel like they're

445
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,860
treasure maps because that's exactly

446
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,180
what it felt like for me as a young man

447
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,980
when I was in my 20s and I saw these

448
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,459
seasonal tendency charts and I

449
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,380
admittedly pushed them aside for a first

450
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,300
couple months and then finally I got

451
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,859
into the study of seasonal Tendencies

452
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,679
and I realized that quickly right away

453
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,020
that there is something to them now

454
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,640
admittedly I've lost money traded them

455
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,439
in the beginning I had no idea what I

456
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,760
was doing I just thought every time it

457
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,319
would work so therefore I loaded up the

458
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,299
boat and traded way too many things and

459
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,880
too many times got burned doing it

460
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,679
so put on the back burner until I

461
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,359
realize there's this quarterly shift

462
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,980
that takes place in the marketplace and

463
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,980
I'm matured now and I can look back and

464
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,040
I can pick out where the highest

465
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,440
probability seasonal Tendencies are for

466
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,360
certain times of the year certain

467
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,059
markets have really strong seasonal

468
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,059
Tendencies to move a specific three to

469
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,940
four month cycle every single year when

470
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,940
it's bullish and when it's bearish

471
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,220
if we can focus in on those Quarters on

472
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,020
those particular currency pairs or those

473
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,160
asset classes we have a loaded deal in

474
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,780
the form of odds it doesn't mean it's

475
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,340
going to be profitable every time it

476
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,360
doesn't mean it's a guaranteed it's

477
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,760
going to be accurate it just means that

478
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,100
we have a high odds probability that our

479
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,520
prognostication will lead us to a

480
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,520
successful outcome this is just one

481
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,460
example of how correlated pairs between

482
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,480
Canadian dollar and cruel both can lean

483
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,220
well with one another in terms of

484
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,740
seasonal Tendencies and even in the

485
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,240
bearish market the crude oil Market's

486
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
been in you can see that the nice big

487
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,919
rallies that's occurred happened to

488
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:29,820
script

489
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,220
with a seasonal tendency we're going to

490
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,919
teach more about this in module 4.2 and

491
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,059
I'm going to talk about the bearishness

492
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,160
as well and in that module I'm actually

493
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,480
going to share all of the seasonal

494
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
Tendencies I have for all the currencies

495
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,320
and until next time wish you good luck

496
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,280
and good Trading
