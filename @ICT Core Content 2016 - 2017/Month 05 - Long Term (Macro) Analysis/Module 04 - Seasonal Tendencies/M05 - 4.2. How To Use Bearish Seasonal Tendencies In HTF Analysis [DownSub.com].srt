1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,280
welcome back folks this is lesson 4.2

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
continuing our teaching on

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
applying seasonal tendencies to higher

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
time frame analysis

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,599
okay we'll be highlighting our topic of

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,400
seasonals with a deeper focus on fair

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
seasonals and higher time frame analysis

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
and our

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
market of study for this teaching

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
is going to be the new zealand dollar or

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,480
kiwi

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,480
okay and when we looked at

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
lesson 4.1 we we looked at the canadian

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,440
dollar

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
and we noticed that

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
while the seasonal tendencies that i'm

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
sharing here there's seasonal tendencies

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
with the utilization of the futures

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
market so since it's the futures market

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
that we're using the seasonal tenancy

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
it's important to understand that

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
the seasonal tenancy may

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
if it's bullish for the seasonal

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,479
tendency chart

25
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
for a particular time of year

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
that may or may not be bullish for a

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
particular pair like for instance

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
in 4.1 lesson

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
we used that u.s cad pair and since the

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,119
seasonal tendency is on the canadian

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,320
dollar

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
we are looking at a time when

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,000
the

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
canadian dollar seasonal tendency for

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
the futures contract would be

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000
bullish

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
in our seasonal tenancy but would be

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
bearish

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
in the u.s cad pair

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,119
because it would be inverted that would

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,159
be

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
a little bit of a

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,600
sticking point for someone that's just

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
rushing through this lesson

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
but we're going to talk about

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
a currency this time where it's going to

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
move basically in tandem with what you

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
expect to see in the seasonal tenancy

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,119
chart

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,439
we're looking at the kiwi or the new

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,680
zealand dollar which is a com dial

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
commodity currency that means the

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
currency is traded as a futures market

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
this teaching also is going to go a

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
little bit deeper in the understanding

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
of seasonal tenants and how i employ

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
them

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
i've been able to call pretty

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
significant price swings in the

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,200
marketplace using hard time frame charts

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
and many of them youtube have

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
witnessed that happen some of you seen

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
it in this mentorship all of it comes by

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
way of the things i'm teaching

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
in

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
these two lessons here 4.1 4.2

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,200
the way we're going to approach the

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
seasonal tendencies in this teaching is

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
going to be applying

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,120
bear seasonals

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
but we're also going to segue into

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,319
how this helps us get in sync with

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
hopefully a quarterly shift in the

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
marketplace which is the goal of

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
position trading or long-term trading as

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
i understand and teach it powerful moves

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
that occur on these higher time frame

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
charts

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
monthly weekly and daily

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
they're in the hundreds of pips for

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
foreign exchange

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,159
so

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,800
it behooves you to look at this

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
marketplace when these higher time frame

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
charts because regardless of what type

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
of trade you're going to be

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
and if you can use seasonal tendencies

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
like a road map it's literally like

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
knowing the most probable direction

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,599
certain times of the year for certain

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
currencies or markets because it's not

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
limited to just foreign exchange or

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,720
currencies it's

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,799
limited to nothing really i mean

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
everything has a seasonal tendency but

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,080
you have to study it and go through a

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,799
long

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
process of you know compiling all that

99
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
data to get to the outcome what would

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
highlight a seasonal tendency where it

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
rests most predominantly

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
if you're looking at this chart here

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
obviously you can see that there are

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,480
certain points in where price generally

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
on the blue line and on the red line

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
okay and it's comparing a long period

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
blue line of time

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
and a shorter period of data

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
and when both of them move in tandem

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
direction in other words they all

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,480
are basically moving in the same

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
direction up or down at any given

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
particular time

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
that highlights a high probability

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
seasonal tendency now when it gets real

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
muddy and it's choppy back and forth

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
then it makes it a little bit less

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
likely there's a seasonal tendency there

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
but just quickly going over this chart

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,120
here

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
it should be obvious to you what time of

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
year there is a significant decline in

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,880
price

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
expected and when should there be a

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,960
significant increase in price for the

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
kiwi dollar

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
let's zoom in and take a closer look and

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
we'll break this down into real

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
specifics

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,960
okay we have that same chart now just

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
zoomed in

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
and i want to highlight

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
a few things going into this

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,479
these seasonal tendencies while we're

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,479
trying to aim at

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
where the conditions lie that would set

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
up a quarterly shift in other words a

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
move that may take

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
two to three months to unfold we're

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
using these higher time frame charts

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
with the attempt to hone in on an area

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
where we can capture

143
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,759
several hundred pips

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,320
in a long-term position trade

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
or

146
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
looking for

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
the ideas to get us in sync with the

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
institutional mindset where the

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
direction of the market should go in

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
these higher time frame charts

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
since it's the smart money entities that

152
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
move price on these higher time frame

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
charts we know there's a high

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,680
probability if there's a certain time of

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,919
year or a tendency for the market to

156
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
rally or decline and it's shown itself

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
over a large sample size of data

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
the blue line in the kiwi here

159
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
represents 19 years worth of data

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
the red line represents 15 years worth

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
of data

162
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
and the only thing it's doing is

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,400
contrasting

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
for 15 years worth of data versus 19

165
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
years worth of data the seasonal

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
tendencies pretty much are locked in

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
tandem you can see pretty much it's the

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
same scenario all the time

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
because it's traded in march contracts

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
june contracts september contracts and

171
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,080
december contracts they are the futures

172
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,759
contract delivery months in other words

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
these are the months that you would be

174
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,479
buying or selling if you're gonna be

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
trading

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
as you can see the june contract has the

177
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,039
strongest tendency to rally and decline

178
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
all in that same contract month

179
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
beginning first

180
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,440
trading day and last trading day before

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
the contract would expire

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
then december's contract has a very

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
strong tendency to rally

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
late in the year

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
and

186
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
understanding that it's pretty obvious

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,199
that if you're going to be trading the

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
kiwi you want to be focusing on the june

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
contract and the december contract

190
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
that's the powerful nature of

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
understanding these seasonal tendencies

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
that doesn't mean that the march

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,639
contract won't see

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,479
specific

195
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,000
price action that

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
sets up

197
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
moves that we see in the june and

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
december contract or that we won't see

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,199
things in the september contract that

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
would lead into december's

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,759
contract month unfolding as we see here

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
in the seasonal tenancy

203
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
again they're not panaceas they're not

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
be all end-alls but they're road maps as

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,599
to what price

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
has done in the past historically year

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
after year by compiling the data we can

208
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
see that these contract delivery months

209
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
do this type of thing over a large

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
sample size of data will it happen every

211
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,919
single year absolutely not in fact i

212
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,720
went back all the way to 2007 and we're

213
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
going to look at every single year from

214
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
2007 to now and we're going to see what

215
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
influence these seasonal tendencies had

216
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
and how it helped us or it would have

217
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
helped us let's say it that way we can

218
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
go back in time and look at how

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,280
hypothetically

220
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
knowing this information back then we

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,759
could have used it to get in sync with a

222
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
quarterly shift or it could have been

223
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
just a unique trade setup by itself

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,360
since we're focusing primarily on

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
bearish conditions

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
we're going to be looking for

227
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,360
areas at which the market is most likely

228
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,479
to see a

229
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
significant drop in price now we can go

230
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
back in time and look at the years like

231
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
we're going to now

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
and use it to build our confidence in

233
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,639
the fact that these seasonal tendencies

234
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,879
do in fact hold up over a long period of

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,759
time

236
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
now again we're looking at about nine

237
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
years or so

238
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,759
worth of

239
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
seasonal tendency price study in the new

240
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,039
zealand dollar futures contract

241
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
now this is not to say that you're going

242
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
to see the exact same type of move

243
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
dollar for dollar you know pip for pip

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
in the foreign exchange market but by

245
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,159
far and large they're going to be moved

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,559
moving in the same direction generally

247
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,919
so i have that as a a point of

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
reference when we go over this because

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,959
i'm not trying to force

250
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,680
a

251
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
perfect pip to point ratio

252
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
of uh movement in both the futures and

253
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
the foreign exchange market there's

254
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
going to be a slight dis difference

255
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
between the two but by far and large

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,440
you're going to see that they generally

257
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
move in the same direction

258
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
so if we're going to look at this with a

259
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
sober mind and understand that yes there

260
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
are opportunities to be a seller in kiwi

261
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
there's high probability conditions

262
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
certain times of the year where it it

263
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
positions itself for an opportunity to

264
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
sell off with a great deal of

265
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
tendency to do so

266
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
seasonally and historically

267
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
but we're going to focus on how we can

268
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
use these bearish ideas to get us in

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,399
sync with a long-term

270
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
bullish quarterly shift now you're

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
probably saying wait a minute michael

272
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
you're coloring outside the lines we're

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,279
supposed to be talking about bearish

274
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
seasonal tendencies yes

275
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
teaching is really how to use bearish

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,800
seasonal tendencies not just myopically

277
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
and only focus on just being a short

278
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
seller we got to be able to understand

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
that that short selling opportunity may

280
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
be leading us to a quarterly move on

281
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
these higher time frame charts so a

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
decline while could be traded we have to

283
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
be mindful that there's certain times of

284
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
the year when the kiwi has a predisposed

285
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
nature to go higher

286
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
so let's take a look at a few examples

287
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
in here

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
there's obviously this one i like is uh

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,560
mid february to mid march

290
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
really significant uh time point where

291
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
you can see there's a really nice

292
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,399
movement between the red and the blue

293
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
line that means the 19 year seasonal

294
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
tendency in the 15 year seasonal

295
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,440
tendency and again i'm going to remind

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,160
you

297
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,880
that it's taking 19 years worth of price

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
action year after year what did these

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
months deliver in terms of price and you

300
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
can see here the

301
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,120
mid february to mid-march time period

302
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
both

303
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,279
the red and the blue lines and again

304
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
i'll remind you here that the

305
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,680
19-year is the blue and the 15-year is

306
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,279
the red

307
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,079
and what it is is a compiling of 19

308
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
years worth of data

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,000
showing the historical movement of the

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
march delivery contract

311
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
and the june contract the september

312
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
contract and the december contract

313
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
and by showing a historical record and

314
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,399
compiling the data the overall price

315
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,880
direction generally is

316
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
from mid february down to mid-march

317
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
there's a strong tendency for the kiwi

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
dollar to decline

319
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
and you can see it very clearly in both

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
the contrasting 19 years worth of data

321
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,000
and 15 years worth of data

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
so if it was the shift in and out

323
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
between the two

324
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,600
then it's most likely probably not a

325
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
good time to be a buyer or seller but

326
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,880
when they both move in the same

327
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
direction

328
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
and it's a sizable price swing as we can

329
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,079
see here in the shaded area

330
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,000
it's in my opinion

331
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
that it's a pretty good chance that

332
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,880
we'll see a decline there

333
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
the second one

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
to be noteworthy of is that notice that

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
if we drop down into mid-march and in

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,399
april

337
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,079
the market tends to have a significant

338
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
rally at that time

339
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,720
and it rallies up to about may and both

340
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,519
the

341
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
19 and 15-year seasonal tendency

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
compilation

343
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
shows that it does in fact make a high

344
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
in may and then it sells off again

345
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,480
giving us another bare seasonal tendency

346
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
and then we have an area where we have

347
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
consolidation

348
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,639
between

349
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
around the june

350
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
month going into july but it makes

351
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
another seasonal low around june and

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
july and it balances bullishly and then

353
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
it sells off again around mid august

354
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
down into october but look what happens

355
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
in september and october it generally

356
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
makes a significant point of uh

357
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
bullishness

358
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,200
and puts the a large degree of buying

359
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
in your scope as far as a trader you

360
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
look at buying the kiwi around that

361
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,880
september october time period now

362
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
when we use seasonal tendencies

363
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
the the way we want to use them are

364
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
limited only to what the current market

365
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,079
conditions are

366
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
we do not go into

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
our charts forcing the seasonal tenancy

368
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,200
for instance we're not forcing the idea

369
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
that kiwi has to make a high or top in

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,959
may

371
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,639
therefore we're going to sell in may and

372
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
just hold on to it forever and then wait

373
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,639
for it to be june july and just collect

374
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,160
our money that's not what we're saying

375
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
here

376
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
what i want you to focus on is that if

377
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
this seasonal tendency is in fact true

378
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,959
and i believe it shows validity here

379
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
the idea is is there something

380
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,519
technically in price that would support

381
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
that seasonal tendency are we in a

382
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
bearish market did we rally up into a

383
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,839
bearish order block did we run an old

384
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,079
high did we see a market structure break

385
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
have we in fact been moving up for the

386
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
last two or three months and then are we

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
likely to you know sell off because of

388
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
an uber ball premium market and then

389
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
maybe we would anticipate seeing some

390
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
breakdown in the marketplace and then we

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
can take a short or position ourselves

392
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
for a bearish move lower

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
so it's a matter of lining up what the

394
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
current market conditions are it's not

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
just take this thing apply it to the

396
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,279
marketplace and you're going to get rich

397
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
it's taking these ideas when there are

398
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
strong tendencies for the market to move

399
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
one side or the other any particular

400
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,399
time of the year

401
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,079
as you as you can see across this chart

402
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,360
there's several other opportunities you

403
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
can use you don't have to be a long-term

404
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
position trader which is what i'm

405
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,160
focusing on here using the bearish moves

406
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,000
okay that's seen in mid-february to

407
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
mid-march

408
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
and then you have another move in may

409
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
that takes you down into june july so

410
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,880
there's other opportunities you can use

411
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
you can see that there's a typical

412
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
sell-off in

413
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
the first week or so of january that

414
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
goes down into february

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
there's another sell-off that takes

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
place

417
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,680
around mid-june down into the first or

418
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
second week of july

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
both lines blue and red are in agreement

420
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
with that

421
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
and then you see another sell-off that

422
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
takes place around mid-august down into

423
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,839
the september-october time period making

424
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
in the low

425
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,240
but there is a small short-term little

426
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
move that drops off mid september down

427
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
into october that's the one that

428
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
generally sets up a really strong buying

429
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
opportunity so we're going to be a

430
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
quarterly shift trader if we are going

431
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
to trade these seasonal tendencies

432
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,800
and we are short around that time period

433
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
just be mindful that around september

434
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
october generally makes a very strong

435
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
tendency for the kiwi to rally

436
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,639
but now let's go back and have a

437
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
contrasting view as well since we're

438
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
focusing on various seasonal tendencies

439
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,600
and we're using them in a higher

440
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
timeframe analysis we can take all of

441
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
these bearish ideas and trade them

442
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
respectively or we can go in the

443
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
marketplace and say okay i'm going to

444
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,399
anticipate these bare seasonal

445
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
tendencies not trade them i'm going to

446
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
anticipate them

447
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,560
showing me the the signs that the market

448
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
is in fact dropping down into

449
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,519
the quarterly bullish scenarios that i

450
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
could be a buyer so we can use bearish

451
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
seasonal tendencies to trade with or we

452
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,680
can use them as guides to lead us to the

453
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
next trading opportunity that would be a

454
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,639
quarterly shift

455
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
this teaching is going to show you both

456
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
okay we're going to go from 2007 all the

457
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
way up to 2016.

458
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
but if you're going to be a bullish

459
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,639
trader on kiwi and we're going to be

460
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
looking for bullish quarterly shifts

461
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,399
they occur in march to april time period

462
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
that's generally making a low

463
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
okay make a note of this because when we

464
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,360
go through each year

465
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
i want you to keep these reference

466
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
points in mind we are focusing on

467
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
sell-offs between mid-february to

468
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,759
mid-march and we're focusing on

469
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,000
sell-offs around may going into june in

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,199
july

471
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,160
but primarily we're looking at

472
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,199
how these moves could set up bullish

473
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,639
conditions

474
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,320
for quarterly shifts and the first one

475
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
we're watching is it sets up a move

476
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
between march and april for a quarterly

477
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
low

478
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
the next one is june july low

479
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,680
that you could expect a seasonal low

480
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
to form for that quarter

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
to be a buyer and then the other one is

482
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
september to october

483
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
giving us a strong tendency to be a

484
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,040
buyer okay so now think about this for a

485
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,199
minute

486
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,480
i just outlined the general

487
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,439
road map on what kiwi dollar does on a

488
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,559
12 month cycle

489
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,919
now if that didn't floor you

490
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,679
you're not paying attention now you

491
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,760
probably didn't get it and you didn't

492
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,439
you didn't register if you're a new

493
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
trader it's probably going right over

494
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,839
your head

495
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
but think about what we've just did

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,679
we've outlined the macro view

497
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,640
on what kiwi dollar does generally over

498
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
a course of 12 months

499
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
there's seasonal tendencies that shift

500
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,039
in and out of the marketplace

501
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
and depending on what the market

502
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,280
conditions are for that particular time

503
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
or that year

504
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
one seasonal tendency is going to be

505
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
favored over the other if we're in a

506
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
bullish market obviously the march april

507
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
june july and september october time

508
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,080
periods are going to be phenomenal

509
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,240
buying opportunities

510
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,799
if we're in a bearish market that means

511
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
mid february to mid march is going to be

512
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
amazing sell-off

513
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
and may is going to be an amazing

514
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
sell-off and you have august can create

515
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
a nice sell-off as well leading down to

516
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,039
the fall lows

517
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
there's also another long in here that i

518
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,120
don't have an arrow to highlight but

519
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
it's that last week of november going

520
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
into

521
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
the first week of december that's a nice

522
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,400
little buying opportunity as well

523
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
so in your notes as we go through these

524
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
slides okay you can obviously go after

525
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,760
you watch the video and go back and look

526
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
at it as well but as we go through each

527
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,720
year just be mindful that march april

528
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,039
june july september october are really

529
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,120
strong buying opportunities

530
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,799
when it's bullish

531
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
when it's non-bullish we can focus

532
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
primarily on being a seller look for

533
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
selling scenarios around the february to

534
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
march time period

535
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
and may into june for sell-offs and in

536
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,799
august into september giving us

537
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
weak points to sell on

538
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
so let's go into our first year and

539
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
start breaking this down give us some

540
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,799
real examples to see if it really does

541
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,679
appear in the charts

542
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,760
okay you can see here this is 2007

543
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
and what i'm showing is december from

544
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
the previous year 2006 all the way up to

545
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,039
the january first of the following year

546
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,360
so we're getting the entire year shown

547
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
in every slide that we show this is

548
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,760
2007's price chart

549
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
and here we have

550
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
mid february into march that weakness

551
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,400
that we expect to see a bearish scenario

552
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
okay and also notice also

553
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,320
that we have a small little decline here

554
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
as well in may

555
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,000
both seasonal tendencies while in

556
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
contrast to the larger moves

557
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
so there's several hundred pips on these

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
declines here

559
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
but now notice also these sell-offs that

560
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
we expected bearishness in the

561
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
marketplace

562
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,360
they set up what opportunities

563
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,039
remember we have that march april time

564
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,840
period for bullish scenarios or

565
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,520
expected bullish scenarios for

566
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
tendencies to go higher

567
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
june july

568
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
and september october

569
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,799
do you not see those occurring here we

570
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,919
have the march

571
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
april time period

572
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
creating the very low and look at the

573
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
move up from there

574
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
at several hundred pips

575
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
then we have the may june

576
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,400
decline but june starts off that rally

577
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,160
that sends us all the way up to the 81

578
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,640
big figure huge move

579
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
then we have another opportunity where

580
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
the market dips down

581
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
and trades off into

582
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
the september

583
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
time period where we see that september

584
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,080
october seasonal tendency to rally

585
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,840
so while we're focusing on the bears

586
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
seasonal tendencies

587
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
the other seasonal tendencies that we've

588
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,159
went through is beginning this teaching

589
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,840
we were looking at the actual seasonal

590
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,200
tendency chart

591
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
all of the seasonal tendencies are going

592
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
to have some measure of influence

593
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,799
now

594
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
again keeping in mind what the current

595
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
market conditions are at that particular

596
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,559
year

597
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,080
it's going to be helpful for you in that

598
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,919
regards because again we're not trying

599
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
to form fit just a seasonal tendency in

600
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,400
price we're looking for clues to justify

601
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
why that scenario would be

602
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
more inclined to unfold than the other

603
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,559
in other words is it better to be a

604
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,039
buyer on the bullish seasonal tendency

605
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,280
or better to be a seller on the bare

606
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,000
seasonal tenancy and years sometimes

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,760
we'll work in concert with another where

608
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,039
the bearish

609
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
move will lead into the bullish move the

610
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,799
bullish move lead into the bearish move

611
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,799
that's perfect market symmetry and it

612
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
rarely exists but sometimes in my

613
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
23 plus years doing it i've seen it a

614
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
few times where it's been astonishing

615
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,480
but as we go to our next year in kiwi

616
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
here's 2008

617
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
for the kiwi

618
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
and obviously everybody remembers what

619
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,760
happened in 2008

620
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
the market uh

621
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,159
imploded we had the financial meltdown

622
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,760
and we have mid-march

623
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,240
i'm sorry mid-february to mid-march uh

624
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
creating the actual high

625
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,679
in the kiwi

626
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,679
and then we had the uh the may

627
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,280
creating another high here where we sold

628
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,559
off as well

629
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,280
and notice because we are all completely

630
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,480
all bearish on all foreign currencies

631
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
the kiwi was no exception here just kept

632
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
on following the rest of the year so you

633
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,440
have to also keep that in mind too

634
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
there's going to be larger

635
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,400
big picture macro events that are going

636
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
to take precedence over whatever

637
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,679
short-term quarterly effect that you may

638
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,039
be expecting even if it's a seasonal

639
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
tendency that holds up for a long period

640
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,400
of time you're going to have these wild

641
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
card scenarios where you know just it

642
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,679
isn't going to pan out regardless of

643
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,080
what you would expect

644
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
there's 2009

645
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,840
and we can see the sell-off between

646
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
mid-february going into march uh that

647
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
decline in there was

648
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
600 pips

649
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,280
and we see also

650
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
during the may

651
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,840
period we did not get any decline at all

652
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
on the bear side

653
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
but in contrast

654
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,039
keeping in mind how we're using these

655
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,960
bear seasonal tendencies the one that

656
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,039
dropped down in february into march

657
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,760
leads us into the march april bullish

658
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,039
scenario

659
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,320
and it was a very strong buying

660
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,360
opportunity there and then we had the

661
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
month of june july we had a

662
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,919
consolidation and july sent us higher

663
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,360
going into the late fall

664
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
october highs

665
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,679
september and october had just a

666
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
continuation

667
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,120
2010 you can see here for the kiwi

668
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,600
we had basically a flat market in mid

669
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
february to march nothing bullish

670
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,080
nothing bearish

671
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
but we had our may decline

672
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
and look how many pips this thing moved

673
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
this thing moves about 700 pips as a

674
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,280
decline

675
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
in the month of may

676
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
but again

677
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
that may

678
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,720
decline set up the june july

679
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
bullish seasonal tendency that took off

680
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,159
and sent price higher

681
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,760
and we also see

682
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,880
there was a scenario for the bearish

683
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,440
august to october time period

684
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
august we had a little decline

685
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,960
which had a small seasonal tendency to

686
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,159
be bearish if you go back and look at

687
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,360
the slide

688
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
and all i did was retrace back down into

689
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
a bearish candle which is a bullet

690
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
shorter block and uptrend and it rallied

691
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,039
off that 70 big figure moving all the

692
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
way up to 79.50 sets 950 points or pips

693
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,919
that it moved

694
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,159
off of just retracing into an area at

695
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,240
which institutional overflow would give

696
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,039
us bullishness

697
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,279
and then we had the

698
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
september october time period give us

699
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,799
that last little leg price higher from

700
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,320
that 74

701
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
100

702
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
to the 79.50 level so 550 pips there as

703
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
well using the seasonal tendencies as a

704
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
roadmap

705
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
okay we can see 2011 here

706
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
see we are declined mid february going

707
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
to mid march we had a nice decline there

708
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,279
but that leads us to what the bullish

709
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,240
march april seasonal tenancy nails it

710
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,080
look at the rally off of that huge

711
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,720
extrapolated move from that time period

712
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
and then we have a small little decline

713
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,159
from

714
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
our may time period where we expect

715
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
bearishness

716
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,559
and that's

717
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,799
about 350 pips just been made on a

718
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,679
decline but finds us trading back down

719
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
into the

720
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
january

721
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,320
highs

722
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
so old resistance turns support there

723
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
the market creates that

724
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
retracement down in may just to set up

725
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
another leg higher june july gives us a

726
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
nice seasonal low

727
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
off of a previous down

728
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
candle which is a bullish order block

729
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,240
around that

730
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
80 big figure and then it rallies all

731
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,279
the way up to 8 800 so 800 pips using

732
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
the seasonal tendency

733
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,679
where we saw a decline in may

734
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,760
and it rallied away and created a longer

735
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,279
term price move

736
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,600
very significant price moves higher and

737
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,880
in september october gave us a swing

738
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
from the 7500

739
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,520
to the 8200 so there's 700 pips there

740
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
okay 2012.

741
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,039
you see we had our decline mid february

742
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,679
to mid-march

743
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,080
several hundred pips declined about uh

744
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
400 or so

745
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,760
on the downside and then in may we had a

746
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
very significant sell-off

747
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,039
and price moved

748
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,159
almost

749
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,760
800 pips

750
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
on the downside in the month of may

751
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,679
and that gives us that june low

752
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,880
seasonally

753
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
where we saw bullishness expected and

754
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,679
that thing took off from june lows from

755
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,679
7 500

756
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,640
all the way up to 8 450.

757
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,080
so that's a massive move

758
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
2013

759
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,559
okay we see our decline here in

760
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,360
mid-february to mid-march

761
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,440
several hundred pips as well

762
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
and then a

763
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,559
another decline in may

764
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
which leads us to

765
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,360
our bullish june july low

766
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,400
and it rallies away from that

767
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,799
and in 2014

768
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,120
we don't get anything bearish at all

769
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,279
between february march mark was in

770
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,960
consolidation and it rallied out of the

771
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
consolidation so it's not expected to be

772
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,679
a bearish area there we're looking for

773
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
continuation on the upside because it's

774
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,360
left area consolidation

775
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
and in may we have a little bit of a

776
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,919
retracement that leads to a june rally

777
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,760
creating the high up at the 88 big

778
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
figure

779
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,120
then we had a

780
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
sell-off in mid-august which was the

781
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
other bearish opportunity taking it down

782
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,440
into october again look at your seasonal

783
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
tendency

784
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
about the first or second week of august

785
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
all the way down into october and you

786
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,039
can see that seasonal tendency takes

787
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,480
uh effect in this market here

788
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
okay on 2015

789
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,600
you can see we had a little bit of a

790
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
move down here

791
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,440
in mid february to mid march and again

792
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,559
these are weekly charts

793
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,480
so be mindful that we're not looking at

794
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
uh your five-minute charts here

795
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,279
and then we have our decline in may

796
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
seasonally speaking

797
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,039
and june july just kept on being weak

798
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
which led us into

799
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
the next bullish scenario which is the

800
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
quarterly shift that would be bullish

801
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
that occurs in september october and

802
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
that gives us a really nice rally from

803
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
the 60 to 50 level

804
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,440
up to the 6850 level almost 69. so very

805
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
very handsome rally from that price

806
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
point there

807
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,960
and then finally for 2016

808
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,039
unchanged consolidation nothing

809
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,480
happening in mid february to mid-march

810
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,399
we have our decline in may

811
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,080
it comes down into

812
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
previous bullish order blocks and

813
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,799
rallies away created another higher high

814
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
up into 74.50 so it moved from the may

815
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
decline

816
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,200
into the week before june

817
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,320
rallying away from the 67 big figure all

818
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
the way up to

819
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,480
almost 7 500

820
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
big figures so rather significant price

821
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
moves as a closing note i want you to

822
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,720
think about how these ideas

823
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,919
lead to

824
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,440
a roadmap idea of where price should go

825
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
generally speaking

826
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,240
and when to focus in on very significant

827
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
price moves when they when do they

828
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
usually occur

829
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
see it's one thing to say okay i can see

830
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,480
when an indicator bearishly diverges and

831
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,559
it should give us a sell signal or it

832
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,120
should some you know suggest some

833
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
consolidation in a strong uptrend we can

834
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
understand that but it doesn't really

835
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,480
tell us when the divergence should occur

836
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,559
and seasonal tendencies tell us a

837
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,600
specific time element that escapes most

838
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,799
people that don't use them most traders

839
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,960
don't even have any understanding these

840
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,559
things exist

841
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,080
now because you've been exposed to them

842
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,360
with a great deal

843
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,120
more detail

844
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
much more than we saw when i was

845
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
teaching in the free tutorial area we

846
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,360
can see how we blend these two ideas

847
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
time and price with quarterly shifts

848
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,159
and when the seasonal tendencies come

849
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,799
into the picture as well

850
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,880
there's a strong tendency for the market

851
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
to react when a few things come into

852
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,520
confluence

853
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,279
if we have a seasonal tendency to

854
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,440
suggest bullish prices

855
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,200
when the market's already predisposed to

856
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
go higher because it's in a bullish

857
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
market

858
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,279
and

859
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,600
it's in a time of the day

860
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
when the market should be bullish

861
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,000
and it's also at a time when the market

862
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
is indicating that interest rates are

863
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
supporting that bullish idea it's also

864
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
supported in the dollar index

865
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
when all these things come together they

866
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,559
dovetail into a beautiful tapestry where

867
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,679
you're going to see a profitable outcome

868
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,480
in your analysis now as long as you

869
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
stick to those types of trades

870
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
you're going to do very very well

871
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,080
you don't need a whole lot of trades

872
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
throughout the year and notice that

873
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,919
there's not a whole lot of overlapping

874
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,880
going on between what we've shown so far

875
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,440
certain currency pairs have certain

876
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
seasonal tendencies

877
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
now by far and large

878
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
they're all going to bend the knee to

879
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
the dollar index

880
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,600
and we're going to have a 4.3 teaching

881
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
with seasonal tendencies where i'm going

882
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,320
to show you the seasonal tendency of the

883
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
dollar index

884
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,440
and we'll actually apply that to other

885
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,919
studies as well but for now i want you

886
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,679
to be

887
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,440
encouraged right now i don't want you to

888
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,799
get so excited you feel like you won the

889
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,559
lottery okay but

890
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
these seasonal tendencies are very very

891
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,840
powerful and when you use them in the

892
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,640
right context they lead to an analysis

893
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
perspective that again most aren't going

894
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
to be able to attain

895
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
everyone looks at just price action

896
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
alone but if you look at what price has

897
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
done historically and dare i say it

898
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,120
hindsight it's a gold mine of

899
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
information because it leads to and

900
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
understanding what should take place

901
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,640
and it shows that there's

902
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
yes there is manipulation in the

903
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,399
marketplace but by far and large

904
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,120
these markets move by a certain script

905
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,880
and they repeat themselves over and over

906
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
and over again and if something comes in

907
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
the marketplace to upset what would be

908
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,760
otherwise a

909
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,840
bearish time of the year but yet it

910
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
posts something bullish for instance

911
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
look what we're seeing here

912
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
mid february to mid march

913
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
we're not seeing bearishness there we're

914
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
seeing consolidation and the market

915
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,200
rallies away and it falls in may but it

916
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,039
only falls down to the mid consolidation

917
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,919
point or around that 67 big figure

918
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,039
then it creates another rally higher

919
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,480
if you remember all through 2016 i i was

920
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
telling everyone that the new zealand

921
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
dollar was going higher it was strong

922
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,039
relatively spanking just like the aussie

923
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,159
dollar was

924
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,840
those two currencies were the ones that

925
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,720
held up the most during 2016

926
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,279
when all the other pairs variously moved

927
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,480
lower against the strength of the dollar

928
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,559
also notice that we had that sell-off as

929
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,919
a short-term

930
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,200
uh

931
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
bearish idea in january it actually

932
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
materializes here as well so think about

933
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,679
if you're a day trader if you're a

934
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,279
short-term trader

935
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,000
okay you can use those ideas to get you

936
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,880
in sync with long-term position trades

937
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
on these higher time frame

938
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
seasonal tendencies

939
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,399
you're gonna be able to blend all these

940
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,760
things by the time you're done with this

941

opportunity if there isn't an

946
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
