1
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,699
welcome back folks this is lesson eight

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,119
of the January 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,800
this tutorial is going to be

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,300
specifically dealing with the possession

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,960
trade management

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,699
okay for bullish market conditions we

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,619
like to anticipate potential bullish

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,180
seasonal tendencies

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,239
and again like I preface in every one of

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,180
the seasonal teachings it's not a Beyond

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,399
though it's not a Panacea it's just a

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,379
rule of thumb a road map if you will

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,379
about what may unfold in price action

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,059
just because it's done it for the last

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,460
40 plus years doesn't mean this year or

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,780
next year or the three years from now

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,980
when you sit down in front of the charts

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
doesn't mean that's going to be the

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,360
outcome you see in price but we start

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
there because seasonal Tendencies are

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,600
just that there's a tendency for price

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,820
to do certain things

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,619
since we're looking for bullish market

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,720
conditions we're going to be focusing on

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,900
the bullish seasonal tendencies that are

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,180
most likely to occur in the next three

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,880
to four months we went through some of

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,100
my ideal seasonal Tendencies which ones

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,560
I like and how it go in to the

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,180
marketplace and look for them

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,360
what we do after we identify what most

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
likely will unfold for a bullish

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,020
seasonal tendency is we have to look at

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
inter-market analysis confirmations is

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,159
there something to suggest there really

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,979
is a bullish technical picture for that

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,259
seasonal tendency to come to fruition if

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,000
there isn't any technicals to align with

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
that seasonal tendency this season it's

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,780
a seasonal isn't going to drive price

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,000
but technical is in alignment with the

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
seasonal tendency are a very powerful

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,900
couple

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,659
what is the interest rate markets

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,520
telling you okay are are yields

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,020
increasing because if the yields are

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,880
increasing it's going to be good for the

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,399
currency that you're trading if we see

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,340
Divergence between the yields that may

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,340
suggest there's going to be a shift or a

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,160
pause in the underlying direction of the

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,459
marketplace at the current moment

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,099
when we look at inter-market analysis we

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,379
are blending the two of interest rate

55
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,920
yields and we're also blending the four

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,379
major asset classes the stock market

57
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,319
interest rates Commodities and

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,580
currencies

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,459
all four of them together should be

60
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,040
confirming your general outlook on the

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,319
marketplace now you may not get clear

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,300
pictures from all four but if you're

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,220
getting three to indicate that your

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,920
directional bias for your asset you're

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,900
going to be trading is in fact what

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,700
they're suggesting as well or confirming

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,379
then you probably got a pretty good

68
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,860
trade idea lined up

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,720
once this occurs

70
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,819
we go into a higher time frame monthly

71
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,360
and weekly chart for PDA now PDA is

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
premium discount array or PD array I'm

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
going to be abbreviating that for the

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
remainder of this mentorship so that way

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
when you receive PDA it's the premium

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,459
discount arrays that means the order

77
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,200
blocks all the things I look for for

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,140
institutional reference points

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,819
we're looking for a higher time frame

80
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,220
weekly and monthly charts to indicate

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,620
where institutional overflow on those

82
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,780
particular time frames will look to seek

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,340
to trade to

84
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,500
when we understand there's two higher

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,760
time frames then we'll know what the

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,379
daily chart is going to do and we're

87
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,760
going to be focusing on the daily chart

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,519
for a quarterly shift or intermediate

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,860
price swing every three or four months

90
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,239
we're going to be looking for this new

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,920
price Wing to occur and we're going to

92
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
be looking at inter-market analysis

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,120
interest rate yields to suggest that is

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
in fact unfolding we're not trying to

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
pick the absolute low and we're not

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,299
trying to pick the absolute High we are

97
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,560
trying to get in sync with that

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,780
quarterly shift to get the meat in

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,459
between in other words the biggest

100
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,019
portion of the move that's what we're

101
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,340
focusing on

102
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,239
we use the daily pdas to frame our

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,620
bullish setups in other words we're

104
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,700
looking for ore blocks voids gaps

105
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,400
rejection blocks you know old highs hold

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
lows we're looking for those things to

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,079
to frame our buy setup

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,358
we're waiting for that to occur

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,820
based on what we see on the higher time

110
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,919
frames and with intermarket analysis and

111
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,800
hopefully a seasonal tendency is also

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,720
suggesting a bullish move as well when

113
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,580
we have these things in alignment we

114
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,280
have a great deal of confluences in our

115
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,800
camp we're looking for a high

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,380
probability scenario in that case

117
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,240
once you get to this stage what you're

118
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,040
going to have to do is to you're going

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,940
to have to determine whether you're

120
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,340
going to be a buyer on a stop or a buyer

121
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,440
on a limit it doesn't matter which one

122
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,479
you'll elect to go with but just

123
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,520
understand that if you are going to be

124
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,560
trading with limit orders there's a

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
probability of you missing moves or

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,820
missing your fills because you're

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,100
demanding a specific price level

128
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,139
when you go on a buy stop generally

129
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,699
you're going to end up getting filled

130
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,979
more times using that order but

131
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,419
unfortunately that creates a little bit

132
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,160
more Gap in between where you're

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,960
entering and where your stop loss is

134
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,340
going to be if as long as you're not

135
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,199
over leveraging your account

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,060
which brings us to how much money should

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,960
you be risking no more than one percent

138
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,900
and again keeping the idea that you're

139
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,860
taking big positions in terms of the

140
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,120
time that you're in there but not big

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,500
positions in the terms of how much

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
you're allocating to the to the trades

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,759
so you're looking for big moves with a

144
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,220
little bit of your account

145
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,199
by having that your risk is going to be

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,139
reduced but your maximum payout is going

147
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,940
to be massive in terms of how many Pips

148
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,919
you draw but still it's going to be

149
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,479
relative in terms of the percentage

150
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,699
because it's just the nature of this

151
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,900
time frame

152
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,520
once you determine you're going to be

153
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,919
buying on a stop or a limit and you

154
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,320
enter the position you're going to be

155
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,840
trailing your stop loss below the lowest

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,180
low in the last 40 trading days

157
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,639
now this brings us back to the ifta data

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,440
range why are we looking for the lowest

159
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,139
level last 40 trading days because

160
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,360
if we're looking for a bullish move the

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
market will most likely not want to go

162
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,060
back

163
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,759
40 trading days to find the low it's

164
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,580
going to be looking for the highs in the

165
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,800
last 40 trading days so that means we

166
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,360
are going to have a trailing stop loss

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,139
order that's very handsomely behind the

168
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,000
current market price and it's going to

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,860
take a very significant price move to

170
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,440
stop you out it avoids getting knocked

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,419
out of the marketplace prematurely and

172
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,919
when you're trading long-term trends or

173
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,960
long-term quarterly shifts the worst

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,039
thing it can happen is get knocked out

175
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,539
prematurely and then the market moves

176
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,360
take place and you miss out on that move

177
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,000
in this time frame you are not looking

178
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,100
to Trail your stop-loss Ultra tight you

179
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,440
have to have some freedom in the market

180
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
you can't just let it you know you can't

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
demand really Ultra tight stops in

182
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
long-term trading you gotta allow it to

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,039
move a little bit gyrate pool back

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,319
against you sometimes and initially when

185
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,880
you first get in the trade you just

186
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,440
gotta have to weather that and

187
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,660
unfortunately it may not be your cup of

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,639
tea but that's again the nature of the

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,660
Beast once the trend starts underway and

190
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,539
it starts moving in your favor if it

191
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,759
moves 50 percent of the range that you

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,280
expect to see unfold on the monthly and

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
or weekly chart because that's what

194
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,979
you're actually trading off of you're

195
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,660
executing on a daily chart

196
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,620
once that range moves to 50 of what you

197
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,300
expect to see in terms of profitability

198
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,060
say say it's a 500 pit range or a

199
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,880
thousand pip range If It Moves if it's a

200
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
thousand foot range we're referring to

201
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
If It Moves 500 Pips in your favor you

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
need to still

203
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
consider what the lowest low was in the

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,680
last 40 days your stop loss is going to

205
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
be below that

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,699
but when we get above 50 percent then

207
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,960
we're going to be looking for the lowest

208
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,759
low in the last 20 days once we get

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
about three quarters of the way

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,380
of the entire weekly monthly range you

211
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,880
want to start trailing your stop loss

212
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,280
below the most recent

213
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,220
low in the last 20 trading days okay and

214
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,259
I'll talk about that in examples in a

215
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,400
moment but your permitting price to seek

216
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
out the liquidity on the upside and

217
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,840
giving it a lot of room to consolidate

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,539
if it needs to before it goes another

219
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,979
leg higher

220
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,780
if you keep your stop loss below the

221
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,300
lowest loan the last 40 trading days

222
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,099
you're going to have a better chance of

223
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,300
staying in the move

224
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,340
and not being stopped out prematurely

225
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,620
okay for bearish market conditions I

226
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,299
could probably just save this slide and

227
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,219
decide everything I just said for the

228
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,479
bullets just reverse it but for

229
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,279
completeness sake we are being paid to

230
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
do this now so I want to give you both

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
sides uh the bearish market conditions

232
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,279
again we're anticipating a potential

233
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,560
bear seasonal tendency so we're focusing

234
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,720
on the Bears tendencies that have the

235
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,060
most ideal conditions what times of the

236
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,500
year are they expected we already know

237
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,880
what they are we went through those in

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,339
three teachings and once we understand

239
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,040
what is most likely to occur seasonally

240
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,680
again we're just looking for it first

241
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,959
there then we're looking for

242
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,300
inter-market analysis confirmations is

243
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,820
there a suggestion across all four major

244
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,160
asset classes currency markets interest

245
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,140
rates Commodities and the stock market

246
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,360
are they all in agreement with the

247
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,459
expectation you have for the next three

248
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,959
to four months

249
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,940
and if interest rate yields are

250
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,560
confirming that direction as well

251
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,380
interest rates rising or increasing or

252
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,080
decreasing is that

253
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,140
Salient to your expectation for the

254
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,700
bearish move that you're trying to to

255
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,700
take on for next quarterly shift

256
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,180
if this does align then we go to the

257
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
higher time frame monthly and weekly and

258
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,899
we start looking for the ranges and we

259
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,740
look for the PDA for monthly and weekly

260
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,720
objectives institutionally

261
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,940
where are we looking to go how far are

262
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,040
we looking to go down where are the old

263
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,800
loads where are the bullish order blocks

264
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
where are the liquidity voids on the

265
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,459
downside where are the fair value gaps

266
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,339
below us where are the mitigation blocks

267
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,660
and potential Breakers we have to be

268
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,120
valueful of okay all those ideas we have

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,740
to start mapping those out because

270
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,480
they're either going to be speed bumps

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,700
or they're going to be rocket fuel for

272
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,220
our next price leg in our bearish

273
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,839
expectations so we have to be mindful of

274
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,120
them going forward we'll have them

275
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,320
already in our charts we won't be

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,580
surprised by them

277
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,500
and once we have all these ideas then we

278
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,880
can expect that quarterly shift to take

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
place and then therefore have an

280
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,899
intermediate term price swing moving

281
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,160
over the course of two to three

282
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,980
potentially four months at maximum where

283
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,440
we see a bearish move take place

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
once we have the scenario outlined okay

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
and we expect the monthly and or weekly

286
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,220
ranks or

287
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,959
swing to

288
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
take effect what we're going to be doing

289
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,740
is focusing on the daily chart and we're

290
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,360
going to be utilizing the daily pdas

291
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
that means the daily premium discount

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,839
arrays or basically we're looking for

293
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,279
bearish order blocks we're looking for

294
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,620
bearish liquidity voids to fill in we're

295
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,060
looking for old highs to sell above

296
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,459
we're looking for rejection blocks above

297
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,380
and old highs handles body and we're

298
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,959
looking for uh bearish Breakers to trade

299
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,120
into we're looking for mitigation blocks

300
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,519
to trade against and sell off of all

301
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,500
those ideas we're looking for that on a

302
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,440
daily time frame to get in sync with the

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,940
move we expect to see unfold on the

304
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,220
monthly and weekly charts so we're using

305
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,440
the daily PDA to frame our bearish

306
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640
setups

307
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
once we have our setup what we're

308
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,779
looking for is

309
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,160
the determination are we going to be

310
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,959
selling on a stop or are we selling on a

311
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,279
limit order and that's going to be a

312
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
matter of personal preference again like

313
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,720
I said with the bullish market

314
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,120
conditions if you're going to be selling

315
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,100
on a limit chances are you may not get

316
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,740
your fill so just take that into

317
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,899
consideration and if you're 100 certain

318
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,180
you have to have the entry selling on a

319
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,800
stop is almost a guarantee you're going

320
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,959
to get that fill because you're going to

321
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,300
be selling on weakness and once that

322
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,060
price is triggered you'll be short and

323
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,320
again but it opens a little bit more

324
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,600
risk from where you enter and where your

325
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,820
stop loss needs to be which brings us to

326
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,380
once you're in the move you're going to

327
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,060
be using a trailing stop loss above the

328
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,060
highest high in the last 40 trading days

329
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,279
and what that's going to keep you from

330
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,820
having happen is a premature stopout you

331
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,660
don't want to get knocked out of the

332
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,180
market before you actually see the move

333
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,459
transpire you don't want to have any

334
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,860
opportunity for the market to have a

335
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,240
move against you

336
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,180
and see it take off once it knocks you

337
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,459
out that's enough it's very frustrating

338
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,740
to see that happen and if you wait a

339
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,480
long time for these long-term setups to

340
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,760
get set up just to get knocked out

341
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,620
prematurely you exercise so much

342
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,440
patience to get to that stage than to

343
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
Once get in it and then it knocks you

344
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,459
out worse thing can happen is you get

345
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,200
fearful or never get another opportunity

346
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,180
to get back in and it takes off and runs

347
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,920
away from you then you have to wait for

348
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,959
another higher level objective to get in

349
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,200
to uh and then you obviously lose some

350
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,339
of the potential profit but nonetheless

351
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,839
you can still get in the positions but

352
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,720
it's nothing worse than that and having

353
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,459
all the analysis done the homework the

354
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,440
patience factor and get in in the market

355
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,940
talk you know knocks you out prematurely

356
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,260
because you're trying to have too much

357
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,079
of a tight stop loss you don't need to

358
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,579
do that on a higher time frame trading

359
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,620
in fact it's better if you keep a wider

360
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,200
stop and you try not to rush to move it

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
up to break even because break even on

362
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,920
long-term trading is just the worst

363
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,600
thing they possibly ever consider you

364
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,399
don't want to do that so we're going to

365
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,959
be trailing your stop loss above the

366
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,579
highest high in the last 40 trading days

367
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,079
and by doing so what you're doing is

368
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,899
actually giving the market room to

369
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,000
breathe and move around

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,980
when you identify the range at which

371
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,959
you're trying to see unfold on the

372
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,180
monthly and or weekly chart when the

373
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,459
price moves 50 percent of that range in

374
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,779
your favor okay in other words it's

375
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,040
moved half the distance you thought it

376
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,560
was going to even at that moment okay

377
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,779
you're still going to be using the

378
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,339
highest high and last 40 trading days

379
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,920
your stop is going to be above that okay

380
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
because you're not trying to get knocked

381
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,160
out once it moves to about three

382
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,720
quarters of the the range that you

383
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,279
anticipate seeing

384
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,540
then what you're going to be doing is

385
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,440
you're going to be looking for the

386
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
highest high in the last 20 trading days

387
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
because you're getting really close to

388
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,620
that ultimate objective and it may not

389
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,079
really get there so you want to lock in

390
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,120
as much profit as possible if you use

391
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
the highest high in the last 40 trading

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,740
days and you've seen three quarters of

393
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,540
the move you may see a deep retracement

394
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,240
that maybe end up becoming the actual

395
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,740
reversal that you didn't expect to see

396
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,260
think like Optimal trade entry it could

397
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,320
go 79 of the total move you expect to

398
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,660
see but then fail and go the other

399
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,639
direction and you would just be knocked

400
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,279
out with a great deal of more larger

401
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,980
loss by using that trailing 40-day stop

402
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,839
loss above the highest high and last 40

403
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,940
trading Days by reducing it to only 20

404
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,940
trading days we're using ipta procedures

405
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,399
for data ranges but we're using

406
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,100
measuring the ranges okay and grading

407
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,320
the scale of how far that move has

408
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,000
already happened when we start getting

409
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,980
mature in our move we want to start

410
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,199
locking in more aggressively that that

411
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,760
position but we're only going to drop

412
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,620
down to

413
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,680
a 20-day look back once we get to three

414
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,120
quarters of the move that we expect to

415
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,079
see

416
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,300
then we have to start dropping back in

417
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,639
terms of how far we go back in terms of

418
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,160
using a stop loss basis you know we're

419
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,839
not going to use 40 trading days the

420
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,760
entire duration of the trade we only get

421
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,260
three quarters of the move under our

422
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,880
belt you know obviously we're going to

423
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,199
be looking to lock in some of that

424
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,420
profit and keeping it from moving a

425
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,160
great deal against us so by using a

426
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,740
20-day look back every single day while

427
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,660
we're in the trade once three quarters

428
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,760
of the move has been seen what you're

429
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,019
doing is you're ultimately bringing that

430
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,000
stop loss closer to the market price but

431
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,220
not so close that knocks you out if it

432
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,199
does knock you out and goes to the below

433
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,300
a 20-day low chances are you probably

434
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,000
May really handsome profit or you

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,680
probably saved yourself a complete

436
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,019
reversal and watch it erode more profits

437
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,000
if you would have stepped just kept that

438
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,279
that 40 trading Day High

439
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,360
so let's take a look at a couple

440
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,639
examples real quick and then we'll

441
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,620
put in this January teaching up

442
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,820
okay we're looking at the Japanese

443
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,279
Genesis the weekly chart

444
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,820
and we have the high up here and we have

445
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,139
these equal lows we talked about during

446
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,779
the live uh teachings of the mentorship

447
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,880
and then below these equal lows we have

448
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,560
these two panels which makes the bullish

449
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,820
order block

450
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,139
and what we're going to do is we're

451
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,320
going to add a Fibonacci just to grade

452
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,660
the scale of this entire range

453
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,440
so we have this high

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,720
all the way down to this low

455
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,399
I'm sorry this is high rather of this

456
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,720
candle

457
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,699
and that gives us our range low and this

458
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,500
is our Range High okay and here's

459
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,279
equilibrium right in here okay so we're

460
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,959
looking at this move here after market

461
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,240
structure has been broken we have this

462
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,740
swing low here

463
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,720
it's violated here and then we have a

464
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,980
rally so we're going to be looking at

465
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,660
this high in here

466
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,040
only daily

467
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,660
looking for an ultimate move down to

468
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,339
this level here

469
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,720
so we're going to go to a daily chart

470
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,059
now dropping down into it and we're

471
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,079
going to be looking at the sell side

472
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,439
first

473
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,880
okay here's that move

474
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,500
we'll refer to this in a minute when we

475
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,439
get to the um the buy side objectives

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,620
but here we have this High here

477
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,540
price has the um

478
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,940
a break in Market structure here and we

479
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,760
have a rally up it goes into this last

480
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,520
up candle which is a PDA on a weekly

481
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,380
basis

482
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,160
and it's also a PDA for the daily and

483
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,260
it's a bearish order block for us here

484
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,360
trades right up into the body of this

485
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,980
candle which is the open comes in at

486
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,080
121.69 the high on this candle

487
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,559
comes in at 21.72 so only three Pips

488
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,559
higher than this opening price

489
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,419
at that candle here we have the up

490
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,160
candle so we're going to be doing what

491
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,299
we're going to be deciding if we're

492
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,380
going to

493
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,419
sell short

494
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,100
on a limit we're gonna be selling short

495
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,400
either on a limit above this close or

496
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,200
we're going to be selling on a stop

497
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,000
down here

498
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,559
which one are you going to do but what

499
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,660
we're doing is once we get in we have to

500
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,320
use the high in the last 40 trading days

501
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,600
I have here a range that's already been

502
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,039
created with 40.

503
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,980
right here so there's 40 trading days

504
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,080
from this day here which is the trade

505
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,820
day here because you have the up candle

506
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,340
this is the day you would trade Look

507
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,260
Back 40 days your stop loss has to be

508
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,520
above here

509
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,120
so your range of risk is framed out for

510
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,460
you by doing this

511
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,840
and let's just say you're going to sell

512
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,200
a limit

513
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,440
if you have a stop loss of 250 Pips you

514
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,080
got to be above that say 260 Pips

515
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,840
that's your stop okay some of you are

516
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,480
probably cringing with that 260 Pips

517
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,600
good grief it's long-term trading folks

518
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,880
and I mean you really gotta change your

519
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,980
uh way of thinking about it because

520
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,900
it's not going to be the same as it was

521
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,020
when we were discussing complete uh

522
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,360
intraday action

523
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,220
and then you can do things like this you

524
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,360
can go

525
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,160
here is

526
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,820
one

527
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,640
two

528
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,840
three

529
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,360
four

530
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,679
five

531
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
six

532
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,480
seven

533
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
eight

534
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,780
and we won't get nine

535
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,200
it just falls short of that

536
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,940
okay so we have

537
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,940
basically eight

538
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,799
r on this trade

539
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,720
that's falling short even at the

540
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,980
objective so

541
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,559
we can have uh

542
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,440
that one off here and here's AR

543
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,679
right there okay so selling short up

544
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,000
here

545
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,860
we have 8 times 260 Pips

546
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,020
the thing about that that's a massive

547
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,980
move okay it's huge move okay and as you

548
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,059
trade this

549
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,039
what you're doing is you're you're

550
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,679
continuously every single time you look

551
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,419
at the trading day you're in you're

552
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,320
going to be looking back

553
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
and again I have another Ranger here 40

554
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,000
pip uh 40 trading days range or

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,160
approximation let's say like that

556
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,080
okay every trading day you're going to

557
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,000
keep looking back what was the highest

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,900
high

559
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,299
in the last 40 trading days

560
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,520
okay each trading day

561
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,900
you're looking at the right end of this

562
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,780
here okay every single trading day

563
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,220
you're looking at the highest high and

564
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,500
you're keeping your uh stop loss

565
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,620
above that high

566
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,720
whatever that whatever that high is okay

567
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
like right in here looking back in the

568
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,740
last 40 trading days your stop is above

569
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,159
this high

570
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,299
at this point here we have that real

571
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,179
deep trading retracement your stock has

572
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,600
got to be above these highs

573
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,240
okay this is where we actually hit the

574
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,039
objective so anything past that doesn't

575
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,780
mean anything but at this moment here

576
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,520
your stop has to be above this hot here

577
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,799
so it keeps you from getting locked

578
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,320
knocked out prematurely

579
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,659
and again eight times 260 Pips that's

580
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,980
this huge huge move

581
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,580
so we're going to focus now on the buy

582
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,820
side

583
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,159
and we saw that Weekly bullish order

584
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,659
block down here

585
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,580
and we expected it to trade back up to

586
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,640
the weekly bearish order block

587
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,880
in here here's the buy Looking Back 40

588
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,100
trading days your buy uh buy position

589
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,799
has a protective sell stop below these

590
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,860
lows in here okay if you bought in here

591
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,200
before the election and we had that big

592
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,299
wild whipsaw even with this wild whip

593
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,679
saw if you would have bought this day

594
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,720
here on a limit below the close here on

595
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,220
the limit on this candle if you bought

596
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,799
here on this candle on a limit on this

597
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,120
day here

598
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,220
yeah you would have saw profits and then

599
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,100
on the election day you would have rode

600
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,600
through all this probably would have

601
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,059
been scary for you but even then 40

602
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,860
trading days back your stop has to be

603
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,419
below here so you're not knocked out

604
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,940
long term you're in there and again the

605
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,260
same thing you're looking for

606
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,120
the lowest low when you buy it

607
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,880
in the last 40 trading days

608
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,220
like for instance if you bought here

609
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,500
your stop has to be below this low

610
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,340
let's see which one's lower this one

611
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,860
the low is 109.19

612
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,140
and then you have this candle here

613
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,820
yeah one and 9 19 so it's got to be

614
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,500
below this low here

615
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,179
and then you have another buying

616
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,580
opportunity on this day here again your

617
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,700
stop still stays below here

618
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,700
on this day again your stop still stays

619
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
below here

620
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,960
on this day here

621
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
the lowest low in the last 40 trading

622
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,940
days is here still

623
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,760
but we have to change gears now once we

624
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,960
get half the range

625
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,220
I'm going to add a

626
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,500
fib

627
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,280
to this

628
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,559
we have our low

629
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,220
foreign

630
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,220
here and once price trades through this

631
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,799
here we start looking back 20 trading

632
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,600
days and we start trailing our stop loss

633
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,820
below the lowest low in the last 20

634
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,100
trading days

635
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,400
so we get 20.

636
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
from here stop loss has to be below here

637
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,179
on this buying day here the last 20

638
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,860
trading days your stop loss still below

639
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,720
here

640
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,000
this day here the last 20 trading days

641
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
is still below here

642
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,280
this day here the last 20 trading days

643
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,240
stock loss has to be below here

644
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,280
and on this trading day your stop loss

645
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,760
has to be below this trading day slow

646
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
and after that it just hits the

647
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,140
objective the weekly bear shorter block

648
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,720
so again above halfway point you want to

649
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,640
start trailing your stop loss tighter

650
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,380
below the low the last 20 trading days

651
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,020
but prior to equilibrium or halfway move

652
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,120
you want to be 40 trading days back

653
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,740
using if the data ranges because it's

654
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,720
not likely it's going to seek that

655
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
liquidity it's going to be seeking the

656
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,279
liquidity above the 40-day

657
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,039
ties in above the 20 highs and it's

658
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,659
going to be looking for the 60-day high

659
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,760
now you can see how that if the data

660
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,159
range comes into play using these higher

661
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,179
time frames

662
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,340
so until we talk again I wish you good

663
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,779
luck and good Trading
