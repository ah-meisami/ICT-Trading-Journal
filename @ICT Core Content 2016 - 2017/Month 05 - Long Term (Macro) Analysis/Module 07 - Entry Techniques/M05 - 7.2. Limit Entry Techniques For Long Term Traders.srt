1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,480
okay folks welcome back this is lesson

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
7.2

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
of the january 2017 content

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
using limit entry techniques for

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,279
long-term traders

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,080
okay we're looking at buying with a

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
limit order

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,840
and much likely used for the

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
buy stops

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,439
the monthly end or

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
weekly should suggest institutional

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
order flow will be seeking a pd array

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
above daily market price

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
the daily should post a bearish candle

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
the daily chart must close the candle

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,600
with a down close and it is not valid

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
while the daily chart candle is treating

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
and or forming

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000
and the buy limit is going to be placed

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
at the bearish candles close this is a

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,719
daily candle

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
so we're looking at the daily high

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,680
the daily low

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
the daily open

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
and the daily close we're gonna be

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
looking to enter a buy limit order at

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
the close of the daily candle that's

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,720
down close while the market is bullish

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
and we're expecting a higher price

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
move in the asset class we're trading

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,320
what you're going to be seeing is the

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
markets are going to be undervalued in

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
already primarily bullish market

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
condition

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
preferably this is going to be useful to

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
you when the market's already shown the

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
willingness to have a market structure

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,079
break it's already started to move

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,400
higher

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,840
it's already started to move higher so

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,799
therefore

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,360
prices are really underway

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
there's going to be opportunities when

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,799
we start talking about swing trading we

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,400
can utilize the information in that

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,759
module to help get better fills on the

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,240
long-term entries

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,079
closer to the turning points but for

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
this module really we're focusing on how

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
you don't necessarily need

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,720
the big

52
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,719
turning points at the top or the bottoms

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
you just need to meet in between

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
and be a long-term trader still and it

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
capitalizes on a lot of pips a lot of

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,200
points if you uh if you do these types

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
of trades it takes a long time for them

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
to come to fruition and long time for

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,319
them to set up but nonetheless

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
when we use a buy limit entry

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
at the close what we're doing is the

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
very next day or the next candle when it

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
opens up we're expecting price movement

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
to move below that down candles close

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
what we're actually doing is we're

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
buying at a deeply undervalued price

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
it's already going to be oversold

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
without requiring any indicators

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
but we're going to be buying at a deep

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
deep discount

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
when the market's predisposed to move

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
higher you're going to see in our

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
examples how it nails down extremely

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,840
extremely awesome entry points i mean

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,879
they're so deep in discount and you get

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
quick immediate feedback even on a daily

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,080
basis that you're on the right side of

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
the marketplace and you start seeing

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
profitability almost immediately

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
okay selling with limit orders

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,720
just like we had with the

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
cell stops the monthly and or weekly

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
should suggest institutional order flow

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
will be seeking pd arrays below daily

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
market price

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
the daily should post a bullish candle

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
and the daily chart must close the

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
candle with a up close

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
it is not valid while the daily chart

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
candle is trading and or forming

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
and the sell limit is going to be placed

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,840
at the bullish candles close

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
so this candle again representing our

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
daily candle up close this is the daily

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,879
high

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
the daily low

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
the close

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
and the open for that particular day

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
and we're gonna be looking to

100
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,640
have a sell limit order right there

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
at the candles close

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,159
and what we're doing is essentially

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,680
we're selling short in an overvalued or

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
overbought condition in a market that's

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
predisposed to go lower based on monthly

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,519
and or weekly

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,400
pd arrays that will draw price lower so

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
institutional flow should draw prices

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
lower on the daily but we're getting

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,519
this

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
up movement against what longer term

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
institutional order flows suggesting

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
again on monthly and or weekly chart

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,360
so while prices moving higher for this

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
particular day

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
what we're doing is we're going to be

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
looking to sell short

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
at the next day but it has to be above

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
this particular candles close now again

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
we're not just selling on a limit on any

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
up candle if we have an opinion about

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
being bearish

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
these conditions are best suited when we

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
align them with

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
a daily pd array in other words if

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
there's a bearish order block if there's

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,000
a gap that it's traded into if it's

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
filled in a void if it's traded above a

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,120
recent high

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
okay or it's retreat back into an old

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
historical low

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
support broken analysis resistance

133
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
there's like those types of ideas we're

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
not just indiscriminately going out and

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
finding up candles and dam candles i

136
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,479
should have mentioned this as well when

137
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
we talked about the stop orders but

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
you're not just simply going in based on

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
the candle itself by itself it's not a

140
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
be all end-all and

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
you know

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
a system

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
in and of itself you have to blend the

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
pd arrays on the daily chart as well so

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
by blending these things together with

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,400
the higher time frame monthly and weekly

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
pulling price one side or the other

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
bullish or bearish respective on those

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
higher time frame charts

150
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,759
when we have those conditions also

151
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
in opposite terms so basically what i'm

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,039
saying is on monthly and weekly if

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
you're expecting lower prices or

154
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
bearish pd arrays that should draw price

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
down to a discount

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,120
what you're expecting to see on the

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
daily is up movement to go to a short

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
term

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
premium when that occurs then you have

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
really really low risk high probability

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
entry patterns at your disposal and this

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
is one of the most amazing ones you're

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
going to see

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
by selling short on a limit above that

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,960
candles close what you're doing is

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
essentially getting that last little

167
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
piece of market movement above

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
getting that last little surge many

169
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
times when we look at day trades you're

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
going to see that that's many times what

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,199
you'll see is the judah swing it'll open

172
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
make the high in london and then sell

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
off and it'll be the beginning of a long

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
long term move

175
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
in that particular pair or asset

176
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,560
okay we're going to go back to that

177
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
japanese yen example and we're going to

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
use

179
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
this idea as well

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
and you can see we have

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,759
the down candle

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,680
and using the close

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
as our limit order to be a buyer

184
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
you see how that transpires here each

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
down candles close the next day it

186
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
trades down below it you would be filled

187
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
only limit going long

188
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
and look at the responsiveness of price

189
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,919
immediately after that there's one two

190
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,400
three four five examples here on this

191
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
daily time frame and while it probably

192
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,759
doesn't look exciting here probably

193
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,600
doesn't feel like you know it's that big

194
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,759
of a deal i can assure you when we get

195
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,560
into

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
two slides from now you'll see just how

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
much of an importance this is

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
but again what we're looking at is

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,479
the

200
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
weekly chart here you can see how price

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,199
was moving away from that 100 level

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
and there was a bearish order block up

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,479
around that 118 119 level

204
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,639
and that was the

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
weekly premium pd array that would draw

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
price up to that level long long term

207
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
and we saw a bullish order block down in

208
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
the discount level at 100 so you saw the

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
willingness to want to bounce off that

210
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
level we go back down into a daily chart

211
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
here you can see

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
in november during the post election

213
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
rally of

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
donald trump's election in the u.s

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,880
price stabbed one more time down into

216
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
that weekly bullish order block uh prior

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,160
to that

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
november

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,560
dip we saw a september

220
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
rally away from a previous order block

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,000
that was formed in august 2016

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,599
september we saw it retrade back down

223
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
into it and using the down candle the

224
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
very next day it did trade down below

225
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
the close giving an amazing fill

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,759
now what you're seeing here is these

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
lines that are drawn right up from the

228
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,919
down candle up into that red shaded area

229
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,479
that's that weekly pd array or bearish

230
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,000
order block what that means is this

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
price should be drawn up to that level

232
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,639
in weekly

233
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
and from the low that was formed in

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
september buying on a limit below the

235
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,360
daily candles close

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,639
from that point all the way up to the

237
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
weekly pd array or bearish order block

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,039
it's 1800 pips for that particular low

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,399
the next one comes in around november

240
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
17th or thereabouts

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,399
and you can see that that

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
limit order below the daily close would

243
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
have been filled as well and from that

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,080
point up to the weekly weekly pd array

245
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
up at

246
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
the weekly bearish order block was 980

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,279
pips

248
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
and then the next down close

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
on this daily chart here again using the

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
close of that down candle as a buy limit

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
order

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
entry point

253
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
that next candle puts you in a position

254
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
where it would have been 785 pip move

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
the next down candle again

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
comes in with a 600 pit rally and

257
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
another one comes in at 500 pips and the

258
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
last one right before it gets to the

259
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
weekly pd array

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
given a 360 pip

261
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,440
price move and again buying below the

262
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
candles close on a limit

263
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
you're buying that real deep suppressed

264
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
um undervalued market

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and it's in a deep discount and it will

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
look to seek to move to a premium

267
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,760
and it's an amazing thing when you go

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
through your charts and you look at this

269
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
and start studying it and again

270
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
what we're looking at is daily time

271
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,000
frames it's not that we're looking at

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
you know hourly charts or 15 minute

273
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
charts

274
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
and a lot of folks assume just because

275
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
we're on these higher time frame charts

276
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
there's not a lot of opportunities

277
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
there isn't as many as you would see in

278
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,800
terms of day trades or scalps no i would

279
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
quickly agree with that but there are

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
plenty of opportunities when you're in

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
these long-term trends and they have a

282
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
real clear indication it wants to move

283
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
higher to a monthly or weekly level

284
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
there's many opportunities you can get

285
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
in there and get positioned and not have

286
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
to get the high and you can see here

287
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
that move from the 980 pip move it's

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
essentially the equilibrium price bar

289
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
just below it and even above the

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
equilibrium price point there was many

291
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
opportunities where you could have got

292
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
several hundred pips and whether you are

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
a day trader scalper or whatever i mean

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,040
those types of numbers are just simply

295
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
not something to scoff at they're very

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
respectable numbers

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
so my question to you in closing is do

298
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,279
you still think you need intraday

299
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
trading to make pips

300
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
hopefully after this teaching you'll

301
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
quickly come to the conclusion that you

302
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
do not need that so folks that felt that

303
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
i'm only teaching day trading and

304
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
short-term trading things

305
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
this is the type of trading that you can

306
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,519
find

307
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
opportunities with still maintain risk

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,680
relatively low and still find a payable

309
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
framework for your trading ideas to pan

310
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
out and this is just one pair

311
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,360
in one focus on a pd array on a weekly

312
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
and monthly basis and until next time i

313
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,200
wish you good luck and good trading
