1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
welcome back folks this is lesson 7.1

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,520
stop entry techniques for long term

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,000
traders

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,600
okay buying with stop orders

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,640
preferably you're going to be looking

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
for setups to have the monthly and or

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
weekly

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,519
suggesting institutional order flow

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,399
would be seeking a pd array above daily

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,120
market price

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,480
the daily should post a bearish candle

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
the daily chart must close the candle

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
with a down close it is not valid while

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
the daily chart candle is trading or

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
forming

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
and you're going to be placing a buy

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,399
stop

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,160
at the bearish candles opening

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
okay here's the high the candle

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,199
the low of the candle

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,479
this is the opening on the candle

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
and here's the close

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
you're going to be placing a buy stop

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
for an entry on long

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,280
positions

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,040
at that price right here this is where

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
you place your buy stop entry

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
the concept is you're going to be using

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
strength to get you long in the

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
marketplace now you're not going to be

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
just buying any old down candle you're

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
going to be looking at the pd arrays

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
that would be in a discount market

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,079
or

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
while you're in a long-term uptrend

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
every down candle

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
promotes new buying opportunity for

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,240
smart money

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
so you'll be using this entry technique

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
here to get in sync with those long-term

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
trends

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,399
again you have to have a monthly and or

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,600
weekly

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
institutional order flow

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
reference point in the form of a pd

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
array that means that has to be a weekly

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
order block that's bearish above daily

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
price it has to be a fair value gap

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
above

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
daily price

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
in the form of a weekly or monthly chart

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
something on the monthly and weekly

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
preferably both

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
is leading you to believe that price

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
will be drawn up there on that time

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
frame

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
the daily

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
you're gonna be actually waiting for the

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,440
move to go against that intended

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
direction that's why we're buying

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
off of a down candle

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
we're using the opening price on the

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
down candle now think about this for a

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,160
second

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
order block theory

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,800
this would be a bullish order block

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
a down candle is a bullish order block

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,959
if price trades away from a down candle

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
and we trade back down into that opening

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
of the down candle that's also what

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
a future entry long position so see what

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,319
we're doing here we're using this

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,080
buying of strength idea

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,879
the mechanics behind it is is that

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
it should price trade back up to that

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
opening price and through it

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,239
we should be turning the corner and

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,760
should be training higher

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,360
but

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
if it doesn't trade back above the

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
opening price you don't get a fill

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
you just got to wait for another new

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
down candle and you keep moving forward

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,360
every time you get a new successive down

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
candle you keep adding that new entry

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
at the opening price

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
so you you would be consistently moving

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
forward one new trading day every time a

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
new candle paints and if you don't get a

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,319
fill

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,720
on the daily these go to the next daily

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,319
candle once as long as there's another

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,799
down candle you keep doing it

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
you may miss moves you may not get a

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
fill you may get filled and eventually

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
get stopped out

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,319
we'll talk about stops when we talk

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
about trade management but for now we're

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,840
just focusing on the entry pattern an

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
entry concept using a daily time frame

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
and now think about this we're actually

102
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,280
dovetailing really nicely with order

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
block theory so

104
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,239
if we're buying at the opening price on

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
a down candle long term

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
expecting monthly and or weekly

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
pd arrays to be the draw on price in

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,159
other words something on the higher time

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,519
frame charts are going to bring price

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
higher the daily charts going to submit

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
to those higher time frame weekly

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
monthly ideas and they're going to trade

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,439
up into those levels okay but they won't

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
just go straight up they'll go up then

115
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,199
come back down to that same opening

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
price many times giving another

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
opportunity to buy so what you can do is

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
when price moves away from the opening

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,240
price and comes right back down

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
you are looking for confirmation you're

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
going to see new buying

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,600
and that may be another opportunity for

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
you to add new positions

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
but that's only in

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
instances where if you've taken profits

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
off in other words once this

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
by entry

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
has been executed in your long if you

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
get several hundred pips in your favor

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
you can take some of that position off

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
with the expectation that you may end up

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
seeing a retracement back to that same

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
opening price if it does you can put

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
that same position that you took off in

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
partial profits right back on at that

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
same opening price

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
and it gives you an opportunity to get

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
basically the average then same cost for

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
that long price

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
then you hold it for the remaining

141
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
portion of your trade and you can do

142
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
this every single time there's a new

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
down candle that you enter on a buy stop

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
at the opening price it's the same

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
concept as going forward every single

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
time until you reach that monthly end or

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
weekly pd array in the form of a premium

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,639
market so once it gets overbought if you

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
will when there's a monthly and weekly

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,639
charts then as long as that's not there

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
we continuously follow along with the

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
marketplace on a daily chart every down

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
candle promotes new buying opportunities

154
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
for smart money the higher we get on the

155
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
monthly and weekly range and get closer

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
to those premium ranges the less likely

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
these candles are going to promote

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
strong buying

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
so just be careful about that you will

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,880
be buying preferably at equilibrium or

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
less than the range that you would

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
identify on the monthly and weekly

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
charts

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,199
okay selling with stop orders

165
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,800
okay the monthly indoor weekly should

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
suggest institutional order flow will be

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
seeking a pd array below

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
daily market price

169
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
the daily should post a bullish candle

170
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
the daily chart must close the candle

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
with a up close and it is not valid

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,199
while the daily chart candle is trading

173
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
indoor forming

174
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,759
the cell stop is placed at the bullish

175
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,639
candles open here's your high

176
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
here's the high the candle

177
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,919
the low of the candle

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
the close of the candle

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
the open of the candle

180
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,120
and right here is we're going to place

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,919
your

182
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,400
cell stop for a short entry and the

183
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
premise behind this is we're gonna be

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,080
expecting weakness to take us into the

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,199
marketplace

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,639
now again think about what we just

187
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,160
showed you in terms of

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
the buy stop on a down candle at the

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
opening price

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
it's just like a return to a bullish

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
order block because we buy at that

192
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,600
opening price

193
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,240
this same premise here is the entry

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
price technique that we use to go short

195
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
at a bearish

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
order block which is the last up candle

197
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
rate for the down price move we're going

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
to sell on a stop right at that opening

199
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,599
price

200
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,960
and if we get profitability in our trade

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
and we looks like we can see a

202
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
retracement back to that same order

203
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,360
block

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
or same up candle in this case we could

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
get short again with the partial profit

206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
we've taken off so for instance they say

207
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
we

208
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
go short on daily chart and we get short

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
on the stop at the opening price of this

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
this bullish candle

211
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,639
we could look for

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
several hundred pips in our favor in

213
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
terms of profitability take a portion of

214
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,440
it off bank some profits

215
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,680
then if we do get a retracement back to

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
that same opening price we can sell

217
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
short again with that same portion we

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
just took partial profits and

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,720
re-established that same initial

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
position back on again at that same

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,199
average price again the premises we're

222
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
expecting the market to be drawn

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
lower from a monthly and weekly

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,199
standpoint so there's a pda rate that's

225
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,800
going to be drawing that weekly and

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
monthly chart lower

227
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
okay so we're trading on the higher time

228
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,160
frame monthly and weekly but we're

229
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
executing on the daily so while the

230
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
monthly and weekly are poised to go

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,039
lower

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
institutionally speaking

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,879
we're waiting for a move that's

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,720
opposite the direction by having an up

235
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
candle or a bullish candle we're seeing

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
the market have a short-term retracement

237
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
or creating a short-term overbought

238
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
scenario when we see the opening price

239
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
on that up candle

240
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,240
traded to many times you're going to see

241
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
that it never turns back from that that

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,960
low

243
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,360
it just keeps on going and that opening

244
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
price becomes a very good trigger for

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
short selling or

246
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,919
a sell program

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
okay let's take a look at this

248
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
few examples here we have a

249
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
nice move up here we have a small little

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
down candle

251
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
and you'd be placing a buy stop at the

252
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
opening price

253
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,000
so buy stop at that opening price on

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
that daily candle

255
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
and we're going to say that we didn't

256
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
get a fill here so it'd be a missed

257
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
opportunity

258
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
we have a new down candle

259
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
place a buy stop

260
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
on the opening price of the down candle

261
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,839
you see the next candle we open lower

262
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,959
than that

263
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,320
down candles

264
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
open

265
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
so in other words the very next green

266
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
candle or bullish candle it opened lower

267
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
than our down candle or bearish candles

268
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
opening price so our buy stop would have

269
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
been triggered as that

270
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,959
bullish candle trades up so we would be

271
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
triggered long in that position

272
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
but now we have another down candle so

273
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
we could take a look at that opening

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,959
price

275
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
and should we see price trade back up to

276
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
that level we could be entered long

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
again

278
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
on a buy stop

279
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
same thing happens here

280
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
market trades up through it and gives us

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
a nice little pop

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,880
and here we have

283
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
that successive

284
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,160
one two three candles lower all being

285
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,440
down candles each time

286
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
we have the opportunity to be net long

287
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,279
the one in the middle

288
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,000
the

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,240
other three down candles

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
you may have been tripped in long on

291
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,839
that

292
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,079
particular entry point

293
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,920
but your stop-loss as you'll learn will

294
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
be below the swing low that's most

295
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
recently been created on the daily chart

296
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
and below a specific reference point

297
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
which will outline

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
in lesson eight

299
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
but you could be long here

300
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
and you can also then use

301
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
this opening price as well to add to it

302
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
so you have a buy stop on the opening

303
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
price of this down candle

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
you see price does fill that and you

305
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
would be net long from that price and we

306
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
have another down candle

307
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
we could watch this buy stop and trigger

308
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,839
in a long entry at this opening price

309
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
price does eventually make a lower

310
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
candle and then that lower candles

311
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,680
opening price does get tripped two

312
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
candles to the right of it

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
and eventually sees another little move

314
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
higher

315
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
and we're going to take a look at now

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
using this idea for selling on a

317
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,880
stop

318
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
and here's the section of

319
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
the japanese yen looking at old high

320
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,839
from 2007 you can see how price made a

321
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,279
piercing of that 123.50 level

322
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,399
and price rejected had a break in market

323
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
structure and had a sell-off we're going

324
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
to break that whole area down in the

325
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
shaded area

326
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
you see there's a market structure break

327
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,320
here

328
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
that's the initial one but there's a

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
secondary one but we're going to

330
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
focus on this one primarily

331
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,640
we're going to assume that you can see

332
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
that this market on a daily time frame

333
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
was getting in sync with the lower

334
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
objectives for

335
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
the monthly and weekly

336
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
dollar yen

337
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
and in pd arrays they would be looking

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
for lower prices

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
would draw price on the daily chart

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,079
lower and i mapped out every one of the

341
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
up candles that went back to the premium

342
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
of the ranges that price was trading in

343
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
for the daily chart and every opening

344
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
price once it's triggered

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
you would be net short

346
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
so there's one two three four five

347
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,200
examples in here where each one of the

348
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
up candles just a short time after its

349
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
formation of the up candle

350
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
it trips you

351
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,760
short

352
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
for the japanese yen

353
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
and you can see another example here

354
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,360
where the price trades back up to a

355
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
mitigation block

356
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,839
and the up candle you would look to sell

357
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,560
short at the opening price

358
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
and you see that down arrow indicating

359
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
that was the candle that you'd be using

360
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
the very next candle you would be short

361
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
and that's that same level right there

362
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
just shown in a more higher time frame

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
view of it several hundred pips again

364
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
and this last one here over a thousand

365
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
pips available in terms of downside

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,160
potential and again this is using

367
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
the monthly weekly pd arrays as your

368
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
directional bias and then using the

369
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
up candles and down candles

370
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
in relationship to using the stop entry

371
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
in this case we're using uh the selling

372
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
on the stop

373
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
at the opening of a up candle

374
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
and the opportunity is and many times if

375
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
you look at these candles here you can

376
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
see how they return back to the same

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
candles you shorted from on a stop

378
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
they become bearish order blocks at a

379
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,920
later time too so you can actually

380
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
put more position in

381
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,839
and you can build in larger positions if

382
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
you start with a small amount allocated

383
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
to the initial position you can build in

384
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
another position in other words if you

385
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
go with a half position or half

386
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
of your traditional size you can go and

387
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
add more back in but have already

388
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,040
profited on portions that otherwise may

389
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
not have been viewed as an opportunity

390
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
so until we talk next time i wish you

391
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
good luck and good trading
