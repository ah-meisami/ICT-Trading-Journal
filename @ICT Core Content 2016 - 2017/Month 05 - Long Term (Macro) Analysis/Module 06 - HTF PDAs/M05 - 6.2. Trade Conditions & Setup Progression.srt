1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,539
welcome back folks this is lesson 6.2 of

2
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,600
January 2017 ICT mentorship

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,060
we're dealing with trade conditions and

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,199
set up progression

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,940
okay we're going to be outlining the

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,700
1200 pip move we mentioned in the money

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,500
management lesson number five

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,620
and obviously it's just a brief recap as

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,059
a refresher just in case you came back

10
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,039
to this lesson solo without going into

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,539
6.1

12
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,120
when we're looking at a premium market

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,300
and markets are trading near a premium

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,120
and we have reasons to suspect that at

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,880
lower future prices in order we don't

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,260
know how much time it's going to be

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,140
needed to get to that lower future price

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,020
but we're looking for a displacement in

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,200
price

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,540
and vice versa in this example we'll be

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,360
focusing on a buying opportunity when a

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
market went to a deep discount

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
on a monthly weekly and daily time frame

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,700
and how we would use that insight to get

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,740
to a higher Premium Future price

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,500
and briefly just as a click overview

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,540
again since this

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,979
teaching's going to be specifically

29
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,280
dealing with the discount

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,159
opportunity buying at a discount and

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,020
aiming for a premium

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,720
objectives

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,000
are focuses down here

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,899
where mitigation blocks bullish Breakers

35
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,880
liquidity voids fair value gaps bullish

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,579
order blocks rejection blocks and old

37
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,159
lows or old Highs are our focal point

38
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,098
for entries on Long positions

39
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
the idea is we're looking for something

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,080
down in this list of arrays

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,040
to Target

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,379
one of the premium arrays

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,480
now obviously the first one we'll be

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,040
reaching for is a mitigation block that

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
would be a first objective

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,099
then if there's a breaker of any kind we

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,900
would aim for that and we'd have to

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,459
weigh out whether or not there's a

49
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,440
significant force that would drive it

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,599
through a breaker

51
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,120
and we'll talk about that

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,580
should we come to it in our example

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,040
and then obviously looking for any range

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
to be filled in for a liquidity void

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,959
and aiming for fair value gaps in the

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,360
premium range of the market and then we

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,480
look at Value gaps bearish order blocks

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,220
and then looking for a rejection block

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,780
and or old high and old historic low

60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,480
so we're looking for bullish

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,540
PD arrays to buy into with the

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,340
expectation of

63
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,739
selling it at one of the monthly premium

64
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,280
arrays

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,940
if we were looking at a bearish example

66
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,019
which is what we're not going to be

67
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,220
doing here but just for the sake of

68
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,420
completeness

69
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,180
we would be looking to sell short at a

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,819
bearish PD array

71
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,940
aiming to cover that short position with

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,239
one of the bullish PD arrays mitigation

73
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,220
block bullish breaker liquidity void

74
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,379
fair value Gap bullish order block

75
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,900
rejection block and or old low or

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,739
historic High

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,560
so selling at a premium and buying back

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,040
at a discount

79
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,640
before we get into our actual example I

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
want to give you some uh study points so

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,900
we keep it in mind when you are looking

82
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,980
at price

83
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,080
it's important to keep this as one of

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,340
the focal points when you're studying

85
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,659
when markets are at a premium or at a

86
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,860
discount they're always going to

87
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,319
initially look to rebalance that means

88
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,659
the equilibrium price point between the

89
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,299
last recent range so even if it doesn't

90
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,980
go all the way up to a deep premium or

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,959
down to a deep discount

92
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,760
you can always reasonably expect it to

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,560
go back to equilibrium and if that's all

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,899
you aim for if you if you buy it a real

95
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,460
deep discount and just get back to

96
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,259
equilibrium you'll find a lot of Trades

97
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,880
like that if you're a big premium in the

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,620
marketplace you're at historic highs or

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,280
a annual high or three month High

100
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,560
you got a real good chance of seeing the

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
market sell off back to some equilibrium

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,940
price point of the most recent trading

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,800
range

104
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,660
when markets are in premium

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,060
again and if you're in equilibrium

106
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,580
you're gonna be focusing on the market

107
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,100
potentially moving up into one of these

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,220
monthly PD arrays that possibly may be a

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,060
shorting opportunity

110
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,820
when the market's at equilibrium can

111
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,699
anticipate a market move down into a

112
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,139
monthly discount

113
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,380
aiming for one of the PD arrays

114
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,900
as an objective

115
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,419
so basically at equilibrium you can look

116
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,100
for either expansion on the outside or

117
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,180
downside now you're going to be

118
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,259
Consulting

119
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,660
the market structure on the monthly

120
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,759
chart to determine what side of the

121
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,600
marketplace you're going to be looking

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,340
for so it's not indiscriminately going

123
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,320
in there rolling the dice and seeing

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,699
well I'm going to sell it short because

125
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,840
it's at the middle of the range or I'm

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
going to buy it at the middle range we

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,740
have to look at some of the uh the

128
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,360
criteria around that price action at the

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
time

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,919
you know weekly ranges just as a

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,039
complete approach or overview all of the

132
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,259
same PD arrays for premium and discount

133
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,860
are the same and the same is said for

134
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,360
the daily chart so we're gonna move

135
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,699
through the charts now and look at the

136
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,180
Japanese Yen cash price

137
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,460
okay we're looking at the daily of a

138
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,759
cash price for Japanese Yen

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,460
this is seen at barchart.com and

140
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,880
historically uh last year in 2016 we

141
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
made a high in August

142
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
and the market showed willingness to

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,500
want to start breaking down Market

144
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,539
structure at this low here

145
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,759
this low

146
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,220
became broken at this moment here so

147
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,139
Market structure on a long term basis on

148
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,860
a daily chart had been broken bearishly

149
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,560
and we see this Trump

150
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,139
election

151
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,500
rally up into bearish order block and

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
then it sells off so we're gonna be

153
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,440
looking at this move in here

154
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,660
okay and we're going to go over to

155
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,680
the Forex chart now just so you

156
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,539
understand clearly because a lot of you

157
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,240
may be knew and maybe you're used to

158
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,220
trading the Futures Market or following

159
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,500
the Japanese Yen cash price but when we

160
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,240
pair it with a

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,979
currency like the dollar Index the

162
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,259
dollar Index is the front currency and

163
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,300
then the Japanese ends the second so

164
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,220
that means if we're bearish or expecting

165
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,340
lower prices on Japanese Yen cash prices

166
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,080
the dollar Yen pair is actually going to

167
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,759
be inverted it's going to go up because

168
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,800
if Japanese Yen cash price is dropping

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,319
that means dollar prices are rallying

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,240
and if the dollar is the first in the

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,580
name of the pair dollar Yen that means

172
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,199
when you're watching dollar Yen price

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,000
action you're watching the advancement

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,460
of dollar versus decline of the Japanese

175
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,819
Yen

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,039
okay here's a monthly chart of the

177
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,900
dollar yen

178
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,020
okay you can see how we've seen the

179
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,060
market have a really nice rally up in

180
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,319
here this is going to be again

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,000
diametrically opposed to what we

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,819
expected or just saw rather on the cash

183
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,860
price on the Japanese Yen

184
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,620
now as a reminder for some of you

185
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,259
um we talked about the Japanese yen in

186
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,960
the beginning months of our mentorship

187
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,639
and I gave you some study points and

188
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,680
gave some examples about this move

189
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
higher and some of the levels that we

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
saw a trade to the 118 for instance was

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,380
one that was mentioned so

192
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,360
if we look at what has happened and

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,699
what's transpired we're gonna map out

194
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,280
this this monthly chart

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,360
and we're gonna get some

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,020
some levels on here we have a high back

197
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,460
here

198
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,720
okay and I want you to take a look at

199
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,419
these equal lows

200
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,860
okay

201
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,139
the equal lows in here we're going to be

202
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,319
expecting what to be there cell stops so

203
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,020
while the market was dropping last year

204
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
we would be expecting it to trade down

205
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,620
into these levels now what's this over

206
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,458
here

207
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,099
these two Down Candles

208
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,399
that is a bullish order block when you

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,779
blend both of the bodies together

210
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,160
because it's two consecutive Down

211
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,660
Candles

212
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,339
okay and that gives you your equilibrium

213
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,200
price point in here

214
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,800
okay we'll take that off and round it to

215
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,899
the full 99 level so we have a range

216
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,600
here we have a high end or premium and a

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
low end or discount

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
what makes this a discount level the

219
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,420
fact that we saw a price move away from

220
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,920
it here now this could be a discount

221
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,140
level as well we want to go back to

222
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,899
where the move originated here we saw a

223
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,000
big move away here that left the Gap

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,940
open so we saw the the dollar Yen leave

225
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,640
the Gap open here where price is only

226
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,959
delivered on the upside there was no

227
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,360
down movement to counteract that up move

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,580
that was seen here okay came down

229
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,620
closing that little range in here okay

230
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,500
so price comes down hits the full big

231
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
figure 99 okay so we have a defined

232
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,760
range up here

233
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,980
this is premium on the monthly level

234
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,800
this is discount on the monthly level so

235
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
on this level down here

236
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,040
we would look to see a move below

237
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,680
these wicks in here

238
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,360
the bodies of these candles we saw it

239
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
right in here

240
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,660
this candle comes in at November

241
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,640
2016 it went below the bodies of the

242
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,779
candles in here

243
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,940
that is going to be a rejection block it

244
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,100
cleared out the bodies of the candle on

245
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,140
a monthly chart rejected

246
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,820
sent it higher okay

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,580
we have a range up here

248
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,760
we also have this down candle which is a

249
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
breaker why is this a breaker because we

250
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,300
have an old high here

251
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,920
old highs

252
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
anyone that gets short they're going to

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
put a buy stopper is resting right above

254
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,080
that the market rallies above clears out

255
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,060
those buy stops here and then trades

256
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,160
down through it once this down candle is

257
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,200
violated rate

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,620
here it becomes a valid breaker

259
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,540
if it trades down below it comes back to

260
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,180
it here we have it middle of the body of

261
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,519
the candle extend out in time

262
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,200
it would give you a level of watch this

263
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,399
is actually a weekly level we're going

264
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,720
to see very clearly when we drop down

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,279
into weekly range

266
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,380
but we also have notice we have a gap in

267
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,540
here which I'm not going to add all this

268
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,459
on this chart to make it way too busy

269
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,440
but we have a gap in here price has only

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,940
been delivered on the downside between

271
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,399
this candle's low and this candle's high

272
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,860
it's been delivered down here as a gap

273
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,180
so that would be one reasonable

274
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,339
objective to look for when price was

275
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,079
rallying

276
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,300
but what makes the buy down here we're

277
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,260
going to discount

278
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,480
on a monthly let's change it over to a

279
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
weekly okay here's the same dollar Yen

280
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,640
just in a weekly format okay you can see

281
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
here we have an up candle right before

282
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,180
the down move okay that's a bearish

283
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,620
order block so we're mapping that

284
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,880
opening out

285
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,459
over to here okay and the reason why I'm

286
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,140
using the open on this candle not the

287
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,540
wick is because there's an absence of a

288
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,399
gap the reason why is because we have a

289
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,620
wick here and the market traded down

290
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,079
through here so this is two times

291
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,240
this little area has been traded to and

292
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,980
it was blocked in with this candle's

293
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,019
high so this whole little area in here

294
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,420
wouldn't be viewed as a gap

295
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,000
or fair value Gap it's it's been closed

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,519
in because the the very bearish

297
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,740
water block itself had a movement lower

298
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,420
initially so it's been passed through

299
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,579
twice there

300
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,620
price comes up and closes it right to

301
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,320
the opening so they also have a we have

302
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,880
a gap in here fair value Gap here

303
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
between this candle's low and this

304
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,940
candle is high that would be an

305
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,160
objective to reach for also but I want

306
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,140
you to look at the weekly chart we're

307
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,140
deep in a discount on the Range

308
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,000
and the price shares of willingness to

309
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,220
want to rally and comes back down into

310
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,019
the down candle right before that move

311
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,820
this is a bullish order block you could

312
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,860
be a buyer here but we're focusing on

313
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,480
that November

314
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,240
loan that's this move right here it's

315
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,740
trading right back into and

316
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,980
recapitalizing an old weekly bullish

317
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,420
order block

318
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,339
let's see what's done it's hit that

319
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,980
right there perfectly and rally away now

320
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,560
on a weekly time frame this bearish

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
order block which is the last up candle

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,279
right before the down move this is what

323
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,320
you could have on your charts as well

324
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,920
this is how you

325
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,480
map out the conditions

326
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,740
okay so that would be a reasonable

327
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,500
objective once the price

328
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,079
comes down hits it this by here

329
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,360
it shows it hit that but then we had

330
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,860
this set up here so which is this is

331
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,260
later on you don't really see this as an

332
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,459
objective once it's already been hit

333
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,680
this wouldn't be no resistance

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,180
whatsoever

335
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,399
so you can take that level move it over

336
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,940
to here

337
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,459
that would be a reasonable objective on

338
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,800
the upside closing in that range but now

339
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,079
look at the bodies here see that equal

340
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,079
Body candles above that we would expect

341
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,839
to see a rejection block

342
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,600
price reaches through that as well

343
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,880
another rejection block candidate here

344
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,760
equal Body candles

345
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,800
we can expect to see that

346
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,660
as an upside objective as price

347
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,139
continues to trade higher

348
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,399
here

349
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,920
and then we have that fair value Gap up

350
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,420
in here where prices only delivered on

351
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,440
the downside

352
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,880
that would be an objective over here you

353
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,899
can see that I'm not going to move this

354
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,760
line all around and then finally all the

355
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,200
way up here to the bearish order block

356
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,579
which is the last stop camera before the

357
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,660
down move

358
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,279
so we have a

359
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,380
discount to Premium

360
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,440
using the monthly and weekly charts but

361
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,720
now let's go down into a daily time

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,079
frame

363
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,339
after I add one more little thing to

364
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,899
this

365
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,360
we also have this last down candle right

366
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,700
before this buy occurred

367
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,980
so right in here

368
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,600
we're going to map that out with a

369
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,680
different color

370
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
so that way we can see

371
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
the hierarchy between the weekly and the

372
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,220
daily

373
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,399
let's use a different color that a

374
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,680
little bit darker maybe a little a

375
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,300
little too dark for some of your

376
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,560
personal tastes but we're just going to

377
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,060
deal with that won't we

378
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,920
I'm going to go over to a daily chart

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,620
okay and you can see here the darker

380
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,860
area is a weekly bullish order block

381
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,899
this is the lower weekly order block and

382
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,399
this is the higher weekly order block

383
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,320
price comes down it hits that and

384
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,139
actually touches both it gives you the

385
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,060
return back to lower weekly order block

386
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,339
that's bullish so it trades two times

387
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,260
into a higher order block on the weekly

388
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,199
chart and the lower of the two bullish

389
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
order blocks

390
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,860
and price rallies away and through

391
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,139
right here on this November bye

392
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,180
same thing we start seeing here on the

393
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,639
daily we see an old high here we see an

394
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,380
old high here we have equal highs in

395
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,560
here

396
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,579
we have relatively equal highs here as

397
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,620
well we have a fair value Gap

398
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,220
in here

399
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,380
this high and this low which is what

400
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,699
that would have been on the weekly chart

401
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,720
by the way

402
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,279
and then we have

403
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,160
the last up candle right in here that

404
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,360
low comes in at 118.55

405
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
so 118.55 so you can see how prices

406
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
reached up into premium level

407
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,560
over here

408
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
now important thing is is if we don't

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,079
see any

410
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,420
retracement to come back into for a

411
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,540
daily bullish order block or or if we

412
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,220
saw for instance

413
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,720
um let's say it like this

414
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,519
let's zoom in

415
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,100
we have this down candle right here okay

416
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,920
price rallies away from it every time

417
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
you look in an uptrend you want to focus

418
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,220
on the Down Candles because that's where

419
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,320
institutions are going to buy either

420
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,880
they're buying at the time of the Down

421
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,339
Candles creation which is usually always

422
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,779
the case

423
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,519
and then if it comes back to that same

424
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,980
down candle at a later time they will

425
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,680
they will buy more at that time

426
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,079
we have three consecutive Down Candles

427
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,279
in here

428
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,899
right in here

429
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,300
okay the order block really begins at

430
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,000
this candle's opening not this last one

431
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
you can use that one but if you want to

432
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,839
be ultra Ultra tight on your stops but

433
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,079
you're really going to be using

434
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,059
the opening on this candle because it's

435
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,540
the highest open of the three

436
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,160
consecutive candles

437
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,260
so that's this candle right here open

438
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,839
comes in at 113.28

439
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,699
and this candle

440
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,880
it's open was 113.26 so it's only two

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,160
Pips below it and you see look at the

442
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,119
the movement off of that level one two

443
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,280
three times you're gonna bought and

444
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,900
caught that last piece now that's not a

445
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,299
long-term position trade mind you but it

446
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,419
is what you'd be focusing on to see more

447
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,360
upside pressure on this move once you

448
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,220
have already been in it every down

449
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,900
candle here

450
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,120
okay price trades through here and it

451
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
comes back down to a hit rate there in

452
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,900
that moment right there adding the

453
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,400
spread you could probably get another

454
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,780
position on there

455
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,600
but more more likely this is one as well

456
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,580
uh you have a down candle price trades

457
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,980
through it come back down into this

458
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,100
candle what is the high on that candle

459
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,400
High concept 1 11 39 the low on this

460
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,820
candle comes in at 1 11 36 so that's

461
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,140
definitely an opportunity for you to get

462
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,120
in and get new Longs on

463
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,860
so having these levels

464
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,140
from the monthly and the weekly on it

465
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,000
gives you context to what to reach for

466
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,620
on a lower time frame daily when you're

467
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,740
executing long-term trades but more

468
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,120
importantly not that I could show it

469
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
here but if we would have lost say for

470
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,460
instance this candle here in order to

471
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,220
trade it down below it we could look for

472
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,280
another return to this order block here

473
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,020
as the high end

474
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,419
not down this V but we could expect for

475
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,919
it to trade back down here and give

476
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,240
another Buy

477
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,580
and what I mean by that any bullish

478
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,340
order block or any supportive role from

479
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,280
a PD array on a daily chart if it is

480
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,799
bullish but it fails to give you a Buy

481
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,200
Signal or a support price the next level

482
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,320
you drop back to is a weekly PD array so

483
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,220
you're going to be looking for something

484
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,840
bullish to support price on the weekly

485
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,020
chart if the weekly chart PD array has

486
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,840
no support and it breaks then you'd get

487
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,260
back to the monthly support so

488
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,539
because you're trading off a long-term

489
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:16,919
perspectives and higher time frame

490
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,799
charts the retracements can go through

491
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,260
what you see on the daily the daily

492
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,539
isn't going to support a monthly

493
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,039
retracement it just isn't going to do it

494
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,360
sometimes this is going to give way it's

495
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,740
going to break through it's going to

496
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,120
pull all the way back to what you would

497
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,559
otherwise not see unless you're looking

498
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,539
at a monthly chart

499
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,820
so by having the monthly

500
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
PD arrays on your on your charts and

501
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,799
looking for them also on the weekly

502
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,020
chart and having those levels on both

503
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,820
monthly and weekly on your daily now

504
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,740
it's not going to be on your executable

505
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,299
time frame chart okay it's not going to

506
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,500
be there

507
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,299
but you should always have in your

508
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,059
platform the asset that your or the

509
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,740
market you're Trading

510
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,240
you should have these monthly weekly

511
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,700
levels on regardless even if you're a

512
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,840
day trader because it's going to

513
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,140
surprise you how many times it has great

514
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,539
impact or significant impact even in day

515
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,179
trading or short-term Trading swing

516
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,500
trading you're gonna definitely need it

517
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,480
but position trading it's absolutely

518
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,100
crucial you definitely need it here

519
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,799
because it's going to frame what trades

520
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
you're taking and it's going to provide

521
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,299
you support structure in the form of

522
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,539
support of resistance or natural support

523
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:29,940
for price to find new buying and or new

524
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,880
resistance to find new selling at

525
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,400
the takeaway from this is

526
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
if you're following the market on a

527
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,020
daily chart just because there's a

528
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,620
bullish order block or a void that gets

529
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,960
closed in or fills in a gap and that

530
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,720
supposedly is bullish doesn't mean that

531
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,520
it's going to keep price up from that

532
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,380
point price could come back on the daily

533
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,960
chart and retrace rather deeply see this

534
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,900
is a one-sided Market delivery here the

535
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,940
Market's been priced in on one side they

536
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,039
completely keep running it higher higher

537
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,080
up to a logical level which was that

538
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,840
Weekly bearish order block

539
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,620
the market moved from a discount all the

540
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,400
way up to a long-term premium notice on

541
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,299
the daily chart

542
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:19,380
understanding order block Theory you

543
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,179
could see that as a viable upside

544
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,260
objective

545
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,799
but for those that simply look at

546
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,140
the higher time frame weekly for levels

547
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,799
to key off of

548
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,720
this is a logical area because it's very

549
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,460
clear and distinct it's last up candle

550
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,200
right for the down sharp move

551
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,700
so this is going to be your bearish

552
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,679
order block the opening on that candle

553
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,500
comes in at 1 1861.

554
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,140
the high it comes in on this candle at

555
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,240
118.66.

556
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,700
that's Precision I mean that's really

557
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,039
really tight for a weekly chart it's

558
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
hard to deny Precision in that case

559
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,580
there because this is simply it's

560
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,020
irrefutable

561
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,299
so when we look at Price every one of

562
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,240
these new uh these ranges in here

563
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,880
they're all tradable so even if you

564
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,919
don't have the wherewithal to hold all

565
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,720
the way through to get to the Deep

566
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,919
premium

567
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,120
Market

568
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,480
you can get a premium here

569
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,820
on this range

570
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
this is a premium from this high down to

571
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,120
the low

572
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,380
these highs in here down to that low is

573
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,539
a premium but as you go through and

574
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,080
deeper this is where the last

575
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,179
last opportunity for the highest premium

576
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,520
and unloading along from that down here

577
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,020
in these discount area

578
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,659
so moving from higher time frame charts

579
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,960
to the Daily monthly and weekly levels

580
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320
moving them on to your daily chart

581
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
that's obvious it's just transposing

582
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,919
hard time frame support resistance ideas

583
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,220
okay but we're using the PD arrays in

584
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,600
terms of understanding institutional

585
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,960
order flow but the main takeaway is if

586
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,020
we lose a level that's arrived at only

587
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,700
on a daily chart

588
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,460
you could drop back into the levels

589
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,100
that's seen on a weekly chart

590
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,000
and I'm going to show you what that

591
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,799
looks like now

592
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,120
if you look at just a horizontal line

593
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,980
all right we have

594
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,679
this old high back here equal highs

595
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,360
when you use that

596
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,740
and let's see what that looks like on

597
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,120
the daily

598
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,340
we have another one

599
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,620
here

600
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,820
right there

601
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,820
and we have another one

602
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,159
right there

603
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,620
and all this consolidation is down the

604
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,200
move here the candle

605
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
making a swing low in here we're going

606
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,340
to look at that as some early scaling in

607
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,140
long they were buying here they're

608
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
buying in here they're buying in here

609
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,740
they're buying in here they're buying in

610
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,960
here they're buying in here it bought in

611
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,659
here and then boom you see that big move

612
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,980
long-term hedging that's what you're

613
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,780
seeing in here every time it's a down

614
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,179
candle and then it's a subsequent up

615
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,500
move

616
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,539
you know that they bought and that's the

617
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,460
footprint they moved the market by doing

618
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,740
that and every time they do that it

619
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,400
allows new scaling in for them and their

620
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,720
positions are large and they can't get

621
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,159
them all in one time

622
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,039
so if we go out to the Daily again

623
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,260
you can see there's that order block

624
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,460
right here

625
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,679
and here's that order block here that

626
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,480
level trading right down here now it's

627
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,539
not going to be right to the point okay

628
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,880
or right to the PIP if you will but you

629
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,679
can see how these levels draw your

630
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,080
attention to where a future order block

631
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,720
on a daily time frame may occur so it

632
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,039
gives you an opportunity kind of like to

633
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,020
anticipate when the next down candle

634
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,120
should occur in terms of price not time

635
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,539
but around the time of this price

636
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,580
hitting this you want to be focusing on

637
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,080
when there's air down close on a daily

638
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,340
chart because that's going to be new

639
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,440
buying opportunities especially if you

640
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
have a higher time frame premium level

641
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,419
that's still unmet

642
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,919
so hopefully this is giving you some

643
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,679
insights about how you can use the PD

644
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,659
arrays in a context for moving to

645
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,700
monthly to a daily if I want to be

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,440
specific and make sure that you've drawn

647
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,720
something of value out of it is not

648
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
because we can take higher time frame

649
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,740
levels and transpose them onto a daily

650
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,080
chart that's not the point it goes

651
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,440
beyond that if we lose a level

652
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,779
if we lose a order block for instance

653
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:28,919
like we see

654
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,539
here

655
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,539
okay we saw price trade down and it

656
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,679
moved up

657
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,000
so this could have been a bullish order

658
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,080
block

659
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,179
price came down here Why didn't it go up

660
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,740
why did it come all the way down here it

661
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,419
went through this down candle to go

662
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,299
right back into which is a higher weekly

663
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,940
order block it wasn't until we saw the

664
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,100
the election of Donald Trump that's what

665
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,960
this big whipsaw move was where they

666
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,120
took out the stops here and it had to

667
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,320
trade all the way back down to the lower

668
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,059
weekly bullish order block which is what

669
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,380
this is now I'm showing on the daily

670
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,600
chart but this level is all on that

671
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,419
lowest weekly bullish order block

672
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,900
so again you can see how this low here

673
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,179
it was violated but it went down to the

674
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,760
most logical area on the weekly chart so

675
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,919
the daily chart was pushed

676
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,500
aside and the values that's attributed

677
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
to using daily time frame

678
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,720
that wasn't sufficient enough

679
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,820
the banks went back to recapitalizing a

680
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,799
level on the weekly chart and that's

681
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,419
what this whole move is here usually

682
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,760
when you see these big surges higher or

683
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,500
lower in price and you're watching it on

684
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,179
a daily chart or if you see it on a

685
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:34,380
lower time frame you just can't

686
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,120
understand what's going on quickly go

687
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,320
out to a weekly chart and you'll see

688
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,460
what they've done or what they're

689
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,500
reaching for and then many times what

690
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,960
everybody else gets afraid of to go back

691
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
into if they got knocked down take a

692
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,020
loss like for instance say you bought

693
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,059
down here maybe you bought this low here

694
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,940
as a old well and you bought it as cell

695
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,220
stops being ran out okay great

696
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,140
about it you start to see some money and

697
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,460
all of a sudden this boom you get

698
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,419
knocked out

699
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,340
if you go and look at the weekly chart

700
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,140
you can see that all that was in the

701
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,340
return back to that Weekly order block

702
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,679
and if it was starting to trade back up

703
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,659
to this level here it could be a buyer

704
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,740
again

705
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,940
because you know that they went down to

706
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,620
the weekly order block and there's

707
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,240
nothing to worry about dude all they did

708
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,460
was recapitalize a longer term

709
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,860
pdra and that's all it was this is a

710
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,960
return back to a Polish or block on a

711
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,419
weekly time frame so if you lose a level

712
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,480
on a daily don't be concerned just go

713
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,100
out to a weekly chart and you'll see

714
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,140
what they're reaching for if you can't

715
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,580
find it on the weekly chart which is

716
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,320
probably unlikely but if you can't go

717
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,460
out to a monthly chart and you'll

718
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,900
probably see much clearer where they're

719
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,340
trying to push price

720
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,500
the algorithm is going to work

721
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,659
predominantly on a daily time frame but

722
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,480
if the levels are already worked enough

723
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,220
and already absorbed all of the

724
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,299
potential liquidity because it's already

725
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,640
been trading to them it will go out to

726
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,340
that larger open float and that usually

727
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,140
will dip you into

728
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,840
the weekly ranges so when you see the

729
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,520
market movement to the weekly objectives

730
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,100
or the levels that we identify with

731
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
these PD arrays

732
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
then you'll know that you're probably

733
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,140
going to have a really significant price

734
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,600
move because of the weekly level those

735
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,159
large funds Banks and institutions

736
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,020
they're all going to Dogpile on those

737
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,520
levels because they're significant and

738
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
they're long term and they're poised to

739
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,539
make moves like this

740
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,400
so until next time wish you good luck

741
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,120
and good Trading
