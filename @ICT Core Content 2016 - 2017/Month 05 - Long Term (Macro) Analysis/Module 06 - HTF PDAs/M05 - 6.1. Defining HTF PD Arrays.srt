1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,600
welcome back folks this is lesson 6.1

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,240
of the january 2017 ict mentorship

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,920
defining high time frame pd arrays

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
okay when we look at a chart

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,079
regardless of what time frame we're

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,160
looking at it uh there's two elements

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
that come to mind as a trader obviously

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,440
we think in terms of support or

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
resistance or we think in terms of audit

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
we're sold we think in terms of price

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
patterns uh secondary but

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
generally we think of

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
a price being valued too low or too

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,440
cheap or expensive or too high

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,480
and

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
the algorithm

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,559
has similar thought processes built into

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,359
it

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
and we look at it in the form of a

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
premium and a discount market for the

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,040
sake of

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
discussion just think of this red line

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,640
at the top as a resistance and a blue

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,080
level in the bottom being support

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
as price starts to move away from a

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
level that would be viewed as too cheap

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
or support

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
naturally our expectations as traders we

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
expect to see price move higher

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,479
when it does this we're confirmed to see

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,520
a

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,400
response moving up to a resistance point

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
of some kind now the problem is with

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
retail trading and with technical

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
analysis as a whole

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
by itself it doesn't help you because

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
every one of us could come to the

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
conclusion that a specific level above

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,400
current price action would be a

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,399
resistance level

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
some of us will see it as a an old load

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
they would be trading to some of us

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
would see an old high some of us would

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
see something else that would equate to

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
a resistance level

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,880
now

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
to remove all the ambiguity

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
you have to have a mindset going into it

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
and

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
this teaching is to teach you the

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
hierarchy on the tools that i use for

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
framing the trades

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,920
now these same arrays are the same

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
things that we've talked about since the

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
beginning of the mentorship but we're

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
going to prevent you from having them

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
in a disorganized fashion in other words

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
there's an iraqi in how they are used

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
and how you look for them in price

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
as price makes a retracement lower from

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
a support level

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
how far does it usually retrace back

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
all of us again based on different walks

64
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
of technical analysis and different

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,480
disciplines we'll all have a different

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
conclusion some of us would use a

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
fibonacci some of us would use some

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
fashion of support and resistance some

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
of us would use elliott weave and

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
ratios and harmonic patterns all kinds

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
of things would come

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
by way of discussion if we were in a

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
round table meeting we're all sitting in

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
the same room together we all have

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
different opinions about how far it

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
would retrace some of us wouldn't have

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
even expected a retracement

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
okay some of us would not see this as a

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,879
retracement but a

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,800
beginning of an all-out reversal to

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
trade below the old low

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
that's the problem every trader is

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
plagued with when they come into this

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
business

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
who's right

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,440
who has the the means of knowing with

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
great deal of prognostication what is a

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
support level and what is the resistance

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
level and therefore what will propel

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
price

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
away from the current market action

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,120
higher or lower because the common adage

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
is if i knew where price was going next

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
i wouldn't need to know anything else i

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,200
would make money that's not true because

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
you would find some other way to lose

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
money over leveraging or or

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
you

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,519
doing something different you shouldn't

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
be doing and you'll break a rule and

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
you'll get the emotional psychological

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
impact because of that and you'll end up

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
blowing the account

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
so

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
when we look at

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
charts we want to be viewing price in

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
the terms of are we in a premium or are

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
we in a discount market earlier in the

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
mentorship i taught how you could do

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,080
that but we're going to talk a little

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
bit more

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
in terms of how to frame that on higher

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,959
time frame charts

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,599
in the form of an hierarchy with the

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,360
arrays

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
as price starts to retrace and then

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
moves higher it hits a level of

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
resistance now for the sake of

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
discussion we're going to say we

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
collectively understand what would deem

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
a

122
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
resistance level to remove all the uh

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
secondary discussions that we could have

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
if we were

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
a front in front of one another in the

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
same setting in a you know live setting

127
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
where we could literally shake hands and

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
talk all of us would have an opinion

129
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,360
about what would constitute a resistance

130
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
level but we're going to say that this

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
level that's noted as red that is the

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
commonly agreed upon resistance level

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,919
the reasonable expectation would be to

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,440
see price move away when price does that

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
some of us would expect one more try to

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
get to that level maybe to go through it

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
or to fail

138
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
that's how i trade that's how i expect

139
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
to see price react

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,040
some of us would not even expect that

141
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,039
they would expect this one time punch up

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,840
there and then all together all you know

143
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,639
reversal

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
this is the type of setup i like to see

145
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
here another pass towards that old high

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
either it's going to give me a run

147
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,759
through

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
or a false break or it's going to give

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
me a failure swing

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
we talked about classifying

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
institutional price swings that's what

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
we've done

153
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
for that teaching

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
here i want you to start thinking in

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
terms of premium and discount on higher

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
time frame charts because the hierarchy

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
on how you view this

158
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
is going to help you whether you're a

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
day trader scalper position trader

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,199
short-term trader which expectation of

161
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,120
lower prices how far would we expect to

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
see price go down

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
well the first impulse leg

164
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
and then retracement then as a second

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
leg higher hitting that resistance level

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
that secondary impulse leg that's

167
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
probably going to be a good reasonable

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
expectation for support level

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
now it could be a bullish order block it

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
could be a an old short-term high in

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
there on a lower time frame if this was

172
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
a monthly chart

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
at that low there may be a

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
daily short-term high that would create

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,680
a

176
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
a support level that can't be seen on a

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
monthly chart

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
so

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
when we're looking at these higher time

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
frame charts just understand that

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
there's going to be levels that exist

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,199
inside of larger price swings

183
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,160
that

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
you may not see unless you go down to

185
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
the lower time frame now when i say

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
lower time frame i'm only referring to

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,479
the daily

188
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,680
because the higher time frame analysis

189
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
is all we're focusing on here nothing

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
below a daily chart

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
so if we're assuming that this is a

192
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
monthly chart and we're looking at price

193
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
the expectation is okay well at that low

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
we would expect to see some lower time

195
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,440
frame

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
support level again it could be the

197
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,600
monthly bullish order block it could be

198
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,560
a weekly bullish order block or it could

199
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
be a

200
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,759
daily short term high

201
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,440
you may not be able to see it inside

202
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
that that little low there

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,599
but nonetheless when we look at price

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
swings back and forth on a chart whether

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
it be monthly we clear daily and even

206
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
lower time frames

207
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,039
you have to understand that there's

208
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,440
swings that exist and support levels and

209
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
resistance levels that exist in the

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
lower time frames that may not be so

211
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
apparent using these higher time frame

212
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
charts

213
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,440
that is not

214
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,360
what you base the majority of your

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
trades on what you're going to be doing

216
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
is you're gonna be using the monthly

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
chart

218
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
and the weekly chart

219
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
to frame the context of what that market

220
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,280
should be doing

221
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
using these pda arrays

222
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
so

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
if we watch price and it continues to

224
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
trade higher here

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
where would you reasonably expect to see

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,919
price trade to that short term little

227
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,400
swing low at the failure swing

228
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
that's going to be what

229
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
a potential mitigation block

230
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
that means any orders that were used to

231
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
go long but failed to make another pass

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
at that old high

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
they're underwater now so they're going

234
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
to look to mitigate those losses

235
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
and

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,400
cover

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,639
their long positions and go short

238
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,440
potentially or just get out of the trade

239
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,199
but smart money just doesn't cut losses

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
they know what they're doing they scale

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
in scaling out and they hedge so this

242
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
would be another selling opportunity

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,199
the market seeks liquidity below the low

244
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
and below

245
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
the second impulse swing

246
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
prior to the run into resistance

247
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,879
so it seeks liquidity below the

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
marketplace once it takes that liquidity

249
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
out it can drive all the way down to

250
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
that old support level

251
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
but generally it doesn't

252
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,958
it will retrace again and pick up more

253
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,479
orders back at an old low

254
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
where we'd see another opportunity to

255
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
sell off and take out the liquidity

256
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,519
below a short term load that was just

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
created and back down to a logical area

258
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
of support

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
the expectation would be what the sea

260
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,360
price bounce price does this

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
when price starts to retrace again some

262
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
of us if we were all in the same room we

263
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
would expect to see that price low to be

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
violated and a new low created sometimes

265
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
that will happen sometimes it won't

266
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
this failure swing in here could be used

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
to set up another long opportunity

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
where price rallies and here's the

269
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
million dollar question

270
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
the understanding is how price moves

271
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
from one level to the next but

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
predominantly it's moving from a level

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
of discount to a level of premium from a

274
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
level of premium to a level discount

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
between the red line and the blue line

276
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
they are extremes in the middle

277
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
that's classified as equilibrium

278
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
or balance

279
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
buying imbalance

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
is seen when price gets above

281
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
equilibrium or up into that red level

282
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,560
which would be resistance selling

283
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,399
imbalance would be when price gets below

284
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
equilibrium and down into the blue line

285
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
or what would be just derived as

286
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
discount

287
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
so where would you expect to see price

288
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
go next

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
that's what you're always faced with

290
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,760
when you sit down in front of the charts

291
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
this discussion we're going to use

292
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
the common ict

293
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
tools as far as

294
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
setup parameters

295
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
in the form of the way they form on

296
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
charts in other words the order in which

297
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
they form and how to use them based on

298
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
wherever you're at in terms of the

299
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
marketplace

300
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
we're using this teaching

301
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
as a foundation that's going to lead us

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
into a better understanding of this

303
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
example we've shown we're discussing

304
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,560
money management for the january content

305
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,079
so lesson five that example for the

306
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
dollar yen pair

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,079
for a long term position trade

308
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
this idea will be used as an example on

309
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
framing pd arrays on higher time frame

310
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,800
charts but

311
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
before we get into that teaching for 6.2

312
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,079
we have to do the foundation to

313
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
understand what we look for and why we

314
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
expect it to unfold

315
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
like we would

316
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,279
okay again using our thought process of

317
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,079
premium which would be the red line and

318
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,480
discount which would be the blue line

319
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399
when you look at charts you want to see

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
where price has moved away from an old

321
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,040
high

322
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
and it's dropping down from an area of

323
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
premium in other words it's two it's too

324
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,959
high so the valuation is going to be

325
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
reduced and dropped lower so repricing

326
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
takes place and the market goes down and

327
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
the price goes lower as a result of it

328
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,760
until it gets to a point where it's too

329
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
much of a discount then there has to be

330
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
a premium built into it

331
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
the algorithm will do this moving price

332
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
back and forth back and forth back and

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
forth until again something of

334
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,279
significant impact comes in the

335
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
marketplace and drives the market

336
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,959
one-sided and it creates a strong

337
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,800
imbalance otherwise the market's just

338
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
going to generate back and forth looking

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
for liquidity based on premium and

340
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
discount

341
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
conditions

342
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
we'll assume for a moment right now the

343
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
market price is here

344
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
okay and we can clearly see that the

345
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
market in recent times had a clear

346
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
discernible level of resistance and a

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
clear discernible level of support

348
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
now that can come in the form of bullish

349
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,880
and bearish order blocks or it could be

350
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,399
just old highs and old lows and we'll

351
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,760
just use old highs and lows as an

352
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,959
example for this discussion

353
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
your expectation is is right now price

354
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,079
is at a level where it should

355
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
by all standards move lower because it's

356
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
at a classic viewed resistance level we

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
don't know how long that time is going

358
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,680
to be required

359
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,839
before the market does in fact submit to

360
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
our expectation

361
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
and see

362
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
a lower price

363
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,360
so that

364
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
time frame okay

365
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
that part is what you're always gonna

366
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
have to submit to time is a murderer

367
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
it's a killer for for traders unless you

368
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,519
know

369
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,040
that some of these ideas are gonna pan

370
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
out for a long long time you're gonna do

371
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
a lot of things psychologically and

372
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
emotionally that you wish you wouldn't

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
have done because you haven't submitted

374
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
the time aspect of trading there's two

375
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,839
two elements in trading you have to

376
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,399
submit to time and price when they both

377
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
agree with one another and you have

378
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,079
waited for that agreement to come to

379
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,279
fruition

380
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,399
that's where profitability and

381
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,480
opportunities are

382
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
so we're looking at price and we have no

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
idea how long time is going to be

384
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,519
required of us to wait before the

385
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
displacement takes place

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
but eventually our expectation is we'll

387
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
see lower prices down to a level of

388
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
discount

389
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
and that's what we're expecting or

390
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,200
forecasting as a future price

391
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,279
in between these two pre reference

392
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,639
points again

393
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
time and price is what's

394
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
essential you have to submit to the

395
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
level of time which no one knows how

396
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
much time is going to be required before

397
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,360
your setup pans out or goes to

398
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,959
profitability

399
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
price is what you're studying you're

400
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
submitting to time throughout the

401
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
process but while you are in the trade

402
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
or expecting this to unfold studying it

403
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
you're submitting to the price you know

404
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,079
what you're not trying to force your

405
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,639
will in price you're analyzing price to

406
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,399
see what it is that's telling you in

407
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,560
terms of institutional order flow is it

408
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
justifying your expectation that it

409
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
wants to go down to that discount level

410
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
or some bullish order block

411
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
to buy back off of and cover a short

412
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
position or could be a old low that it

413
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,639
wants to run below

414
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
that future price could be a number of

415
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
things but for now we're just going to

416
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,560
aim for an old low between the market

417
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
price today and the future price which

418
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
you anticipate or forecast lower in the

419
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,839
future

420
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
there's going to be

421
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,040
zero opportunity for it to be a straight

422
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
line in other words you're not seeing

423
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
that diagonal line in the way the market

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,240
trades it just doesn't do that there's

425
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
always some give and take that takes

426
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
place so

427
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
understanding where certain arrays occur

428
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
in that process will help you number one

429
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,399
stay with the trade idea

430
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
not be shaken out of it and have the

431
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
confidence to hold until the objective

432
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,279
is met or

433
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
your stop gets taken and it's simply

434
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
moving to a next opportunity the

435
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
opposite scene

436
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,880
when you're looking for a bullish

437
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
scenario

438
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
everything's just reversed

439
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
you expect market price to be in the

440
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
future at a premium in other words it's

441
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,279
going to be higher than it is today

442
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,360
again you have no idea how long time is

443
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,760
going to be required

444
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
to get to your future price or

445
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
forecasted price and you have to submit

446
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,839
to that a measure of time that is

447
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,480
unknown you can't know for certainty how

448
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,399
many days or how many hours or or how

449
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,920
many months it will be before that price

450
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,199
is actually arrived at or if at all

451
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,800
but you also have to be studying price

452
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
and again monitoring and studying the

453
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
the pd arrays that occur in price action

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
that leads to supporting your

455
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
expectation on institutional order flow

456
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
that would drive price up into that

457
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
premium level

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
the understanding is that price will

459
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,120
move from a discount to a premium

460
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,519
because the discount can't stay discount

461
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,360
very long price is going to be

462
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
established by whoever is selling it who

463
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,160
who stands to make a profit off of it

464
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,399
well the central bank is going to be in

465
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
in the business of adjusting price so if

466
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
we know that they are in control of

467
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,000
price ultimately

468
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
by way of steering sentiment in

469
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,279
economies through the delivery of an

470
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,800
interest rate long term to stimulate or

471
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
to suppress an economy for our country

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
we have to view the market in terms of

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
technicals to align ourselves with these

474
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
ideas so

475
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,759
if we see a level of support

476
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
our expectation is okay where is the

477
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
evidence that this thing will go to a

478
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,279
premium market

479
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,560
where is the premium market where's the

480
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
resistance at where's the higher level

481
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
that i would want to see it trade to

482
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
between the market price you're at right

483
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
now in that future price again it never

484
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
happens in a straight line there's time

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
that you have no understanding of

486
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
exactly how long it's going to be

487
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
but there's also an element of price

488
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
that you have to study in other words

489
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,279
just because you think it's going there

490
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,799
doesn't mean it's going there it could

491
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,520
go halfway there and fail and go lower

492
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
nonetheless

493
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,240
what we're going to do is we're going to

494
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,199
outline now the arrays and keep them in

495
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
a specific order so that way you know

496
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,079
wherever you're at in terms of market

497
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
price what you would expect to see or

498
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
what you're looking for

499
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,839
okay you know you know what should i be

500
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
looking for an order block or should i

501
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
be looking for

502
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
a gap you know what should i look for

503
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,240
right now that's what this teaching's

504
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,559
going to do

505
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
okay for a monthly chart okay what

506
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
you're going to do is you're going to

507
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
look at

508
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
the current trading range that it's in

509
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
okay and

510
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,960
so we're going to assume that you uh

511
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
outline the marketplace in terms of old

512
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,960
highs and all lows on the monthly and

513
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
that's the easiest way of doing it

514
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
there's other ways you can do it but for

515
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
now we're just going to outline in the

516
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
context that the most recent trading

517
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
range that the market has moved from an

518
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
old high

519
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
to an old low that would be our

520
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
premium and discount

521
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
definition

522
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
in between these two reference points

523
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
the halfway point this is always going

524
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
to be referred to as equilibrium

525
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
now equilibrium between where you think

526
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
price will go because it's been there

527
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
before

528
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,960
and where it's at right now

529
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
relative to an old high and old low

530
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
that's the current trading range and

531
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,080
i'll give you an example what that looks

532
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
like when we go into lesson 6.2 but for

533
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,640
now i want to lay the foundations for

534
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
what it is you look for

535
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
the first thing above equilibrium in the

536
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
form of an array is an old high and old

537
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
low

538
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
you want to be looking for that above

539
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,720
equilibrium

540
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,559
the next

541
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,760
thing that you'll be looking for and

542
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
this is in the order of importance okay

543
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
hold high or low then the next thing

544
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
you'll be looking for is a rejection

545
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,679
block a rejection block will be just

546
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
above the candle's body

547
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
not the wicks

548
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
so the actual high and low is the wick

549
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
but then the next area of importance is

550
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
the rejection block that would be just

551
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,120
above the candle's body

552
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,280
then the bearish order block

553
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
a fair value gap

554
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
liquidity void

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,559
bearish breaker

556
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,120
and the mitigation block

557
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
put another way

558
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,880
if we were at equilibrium and we were

559
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
moving away from

560
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
a premium level or resistance in other

561
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
words prices already dropped down

562
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
and we anticipate price going lower down

563
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,840
to a level of support or monthly

564
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,160
discount we would be looking for above

565
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,679
current market action again assuming

566
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,679
that we're at equilibrium right now we

567
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
would start looking above current market

568
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
action in the past on the left side of

569
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,840
our chart

570
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
where is the nearest mitigation block

571
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
there may not be one

572
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
okay check that off

573
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,120
where's the nearest bearish breaker

574
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,960
there may not be one of those either

575
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
okay check that off but if there is one

576
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,960
then you would reasonably expect to see

577
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,880
price trade up to that price point to

578
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,080
breaker

579
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,320
then expect some selling to go lower and

580
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,919
once it moves below equilibrium then you

581
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,000
would be all set to go to the monthly

582
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
discount or support but let's assume for

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
a moment the mitigation block isn't

584
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,160
there and the breaker isn't there what

585
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,080
would you look for next okay well the

586
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
next order of hierarchy is liquidity

587
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
void

588
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
is there a range that needs to be closed

589
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
in

590
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
again that may not be so clear

591
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
check that off no problem the next thing

592
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
is their fair value gap

593
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,159
again that might not exist either go to

594
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,400
the next thing bearish order block

595
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
that's probably going to be there

596
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
chances are it's very strong that's

597
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,679
going to be there so what did this give

598
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,360
you i gave you the air archie and which

599
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
you look for

600
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
a mitigation block

601
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
is going to be first considered before

602
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
you get to the bearish order block

603
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,600
because the various order blocks will be

604
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
really high up in the premium

605
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,799
mitigation block is going to be the

606
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,760
lowest

607
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
mitigation and breakers are basically

608
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
mitigation blocks but

609
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
generally mitigation blocks can occur

610
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,799
lower than breakers

611
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,400
small little bounces and bear markets

612
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
would be a mitigation block basically a

613
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,440
bearish breaker will keep your ability

614
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
to get to a bearish order block which

615
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
will be resting higher up in the premium

616
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
when an old high is taken out

617
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
that down candle right before the second

618
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,880
high is made taking an old high

619
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
or turtle soup in other words

620
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,400
that down candle

621
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,360
if it's

622
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
retreated too that's going to be a

623
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,360
bearish breaker that's going to keep you

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
from seeing most likely high probability

625
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
that it won't allow you to get to a

626
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,159
bearish order block so whenever you see

627
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,440
bearish breakers

628
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,400
just

629
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
don't expect the bearish order block to

630
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,679
be hit okay because it's going to most

631
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,039
likely keep

632
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,559
price lower because that's going to be

633
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,200
the most dominant

634
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
array of all these in here

635
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
there is a liquidity void that would be

636
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
viewed

637
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
if there's no breaker you can close in

638
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
that range and that may take you often

639
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
to a fair value gap or a bearish order

640
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,559
block

641
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,720
but breakers by themselves even though

642
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,120
they're low end on this list

643
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,240
it's the first thing you're going to

644
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
encounter because if you're at

645
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
equilibrium and price has already been

646
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
moving away from the resistance level

647
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
you're looking up now for any potential

648
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
areas to resell at

649
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,799
first when you look at is the mitigation

650
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,679
block

651
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,600
or bearish breaker and if there's

652
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,360
neither of those you look for liquidity

653
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,799
void to trade up into the close in that

654
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,320
range warfare value gap to close in it

655
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
may not be any of that then you would

656
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,039
expect to see the bear shorter block to

657
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
be traded to then that would be your

658
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
selling opportunity because you're at a

659
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,000
premium and you go to a logical area

660
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
where institutional overflow would kick

661
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
in new orders would capitalize and then

662
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,559
selling would

663
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,640
ensue

664
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
if there isn't an obvious bearish order

665
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
block okay um and there's very little

666
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,960
times that's like that

667
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
but we will talk about that when we get

668
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,320
into entry techniques and concepts but

669
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,799
if there is a lack of bearish order

670
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
block

671
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,600
understanding and what you're looking at

672
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
currently in the market action because

673
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
there may be a lot of wicks something

674
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
like that may occur

675
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,600
again you would look for a rejection

676
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
block which would be just above the body

677
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
of the candles you would expect that to

678
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
be ran out and then you'd be really high

679
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
on the premium there and ultimately a

680
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,799
whole whole entire run on the old high

681
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
that would be uh an expectation now i

682
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
have here old high and old low

683
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
why would the low be there well if

684
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,799
you're on a

685
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,440
very low end of a downtrend on a higher

686
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
time frame monthly chart you may be

687
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
rallying up to a old low if it gets to

688
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
that old low even though

689
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
it's an old low in in terms of price

690
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,080
it's really high up in the premium if

691
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600
it's been rallying a considerable amount

692
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
of time and price to get to that level

693
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
so retreating to an old low

694
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,960
that's resistance classic understanding

695
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
but it may need to run out of old high

696
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
as well so basically all you're doing is

697
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
you're you're scaling the grade of how

698
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,280
much importance you're going to have on

699
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,200
each one of these

700
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
so again in summary i want you to

701
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,159
understand what i'm talking about here

702
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,600
we're not just listing the things we've

703
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,919
talked about in in previous teachings

704
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,600
okay i'm putting them in an order of

705
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,279
significance when you're at equilibrium

706
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,480
or

707
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
if you're moving up from discount

708
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,840
okay

709
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
your

710
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,600
expectations are to look for very first

711
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
thing you look for in the list as price

712
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,039
is going up the first thing you're

713
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,200
looking to see to encounter is there any

714
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,360
mitigation block that i got to consider

715
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
because that's the first objective

716
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,760
it could be a selling point

717
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
then it's a bearish breaker

718
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
that could set the tone for another leg

719
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,400
lower or stop any rallies on a bullish

720
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
idea

721
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,760
then the next idea if you're bullish

722
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,279
from a discount or if you're expecting a

723
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
new selling opportunity say you're at

724
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,080
the equilibrium price point anything

725
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,600
below

726
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
the premium

727
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,679
the expectation is when you're looking

728
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
up in price for areas where price may go

729
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,039
up to

730
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
it's in this order from the lowest up

731
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
in other words from mitigation block all

732
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,480
the way up to old high or low

733
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
that's the order you would expect to see

734
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,520
them now

735
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,919
the order of importance

736
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
you know it's the highest of the premium

737
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,760
array is the old high and old low

738
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
that's that's as high as you can get

739
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,640
then you have rejection block

740
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
then you have bearish order block fair

741
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
fair value gap and liquidity void

742
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
bearish breaker and mitigation block

743
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
you're going to be looking up and the

744
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
first thing you're going to encounter is

745
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
the first thing on the bottom of this

746
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
list and then you start working your way

747
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
up that list the farther you go up in

748
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
this list the more deeper you go into a

749
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,320
premium market

750
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,200
certain arrays in here will keep you

751
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
from seeing the next higher array in

752
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,720
other words the next

753
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,960
institutional order reference point

754
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
that's listed in here if you get to a

755
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,159
breaker chances are you're probably not

756
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
going to go higher than that you won't

757
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,679
generally get up in to close that void

758
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120
if there's a breaker below a liquidity

759
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
void the liquidity void may stay open

760
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,760
basically that range may stay open so

761
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
they kind of like it's in the order of

762
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,720
importance as a trader when you're below

763
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,799
premium and looking higher up for prices

764
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
or expecting prices to move higher

765
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
that mitigation block you know that's

766
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
the lowest or the most

767
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,640
likely one you're going to expect to run

768
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
into first it doesn't mean that there's

769
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
one in price action but you start from

770
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
that expectation first and you look for

771
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,080
it it's not there okay what's the next

772
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,200
thing you've been looking for the

773
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
bearish breaker if it's not there okay

774
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,440
then i'm okay to expect that void to

775
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
close in there but there may not be a

776
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
void it may have been a really

777
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
systematic and efficient way that it

778
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,919
traded lower

779
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,799
and that won't be any void there so

780
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
next thing is is there a gap that would

781
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,559
draw price up into it if there's no gap

782
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
then you go right to the order block

783
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,720
okay but the main thing is if there's a

784
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
breaker forget about closing in the void

785
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
and forget about getting up to that gap

786
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
because the breaker is going to take

787
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
precedence over everything on this list

788
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
when you're below it in terms of market

789
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,240
price if we were anticipating move lower

790
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
into price

791
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,640
into a discount or into a support level

792
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
we would expect the very next

793
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
pd array to be a

794
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,360
mitigation block

795
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
now again that may not appear in price

796
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
if there is no mitigation block you

797
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
would expect to see the next pd array in

798
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,679
the form of

799
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,760
a bullish breaker

800
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,159
again this may not occur or be seen in

801
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
price action but this is the order in

802
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,360
which you would expect to see as prices

803
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,520
going lower looking in the past to the

804
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,039
left side of your chart you'll be

805
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
focusing on whether or not these arrays

806
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,960
appear in price action

807
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
their importance is again is listed from

808
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,400
equilibrium

809
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,159
the expected order of how they're going

810
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:38,960
to

811
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
be in the price action

812
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
in the form of a discount the first one

813
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,320
you would anticipate seeing is a

814
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,159
mitigation block bullishly then a

815
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,480
bullish breaker

816
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
then a liquidity void now

817
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,279
if there is a bullish breaker now again

818
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,360
a bullish breaker is a

819
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
up candle between two swing lows and the

820
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,000
most recent swing low

821
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
would be lower normally you're seeing a

822
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
stop run in the past

823
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
and

824
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
the high the swing height it forms

825
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
between the two lows

826
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,840
that up candle is going to be your

827
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
bullish breaker so when price comes down

828
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,600
to that bullish of candle it'll find

829
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,960
some support

830
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
if you see that in price action

831
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,320
chances are that if there's a liquidity

832
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
void in price it won't go down to fill

833
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,039
that in it can if it overtakes the

834
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,279
breaker but if it has a breaker

835
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,600
anticipate price not going below the

836
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,440
breaker and leaving the void intact

837
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,159
again assuming there is no breaker

838
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,159
and there is no void but there is a gap

839
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
and it may be a liquidity void any gap

840
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,679
sometimes that can occur too but you

841
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
would anticipate price reaching down

842
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
into a fair value gap which is just a

843
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,640
common little gap where price has only

844
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,600
been delivered on one side of the

845
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
marketplace

846
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
and then the next

847
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
array would be the bullish order block

848
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,720
and again without the breaker

849
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,880
you would expect the void to be filled a

850
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
gap to be filled straight down into the

851
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
bullish order block then below the order

852
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,399
block would be a rejection block which

853
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,000
is just below the most lowest candle and

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
its body in other words if it has wicks

855
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
long wicks below it

856
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,559
uh we're only gonna be looking for a

857
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,320
move just below the bodies of the candle

858
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,679
and that would be rejection block

859
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
and then ultimately the deepest form of

860
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
discount would be in the form of an old

861
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
low or trading down to in the historic

862
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
high and like we said when we were

863
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,840
talking about the premium market

864
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
when prices trade up to an old high it

865
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
can also trade up to a very old

866
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,399
long-term low and that would both be in

867
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,840
the form of a resistance level

868
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
when we look at markets like this

869
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,360
what it does is it gives us a framework

870
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,039
you see here

871
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,039
the monthly premium

872
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,200
arrays these are going to be focused for

873
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,760
primarily bearish premium array trading

874
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,720
in other words you're going to be using

875
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
these areas at which to frame a trade or

876
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,360
look for bullish targets at these levels

877
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,919
for monthly discount

878
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,240
your bullish discount arrays

879
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,039
these are your bullish discount arrays

880
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,960
and you would be looking for these

881
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,760
for

882
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
bearish targets or looking to get long

883
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
at any one of these based on the current

884
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
conditions in the market now the same

885
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
thing is seen also for the weekly chart

886
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,919
the weekly chart you're going to be

887
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
looking at the same thing from

888
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,159
equilibrium up

889
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,360
the first thing you would expect to see

890
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,799
when you're expecting higher prices are

891
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
we going to run into a mitigation block

892
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
bearish breaker if there's a bearish

893
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,760
breaker you're probably not going to go

894
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,039
higher than that

895
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,640
but if there is no breaker you look for

896
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
a void to close in

897
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
or if your value gap

898
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,559
if there is no fair value gap or avoid

899
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,919
price could just simply trade right up

900
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,840
into the bearish order block

901
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
and if there is

902
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,360
an idea that suggests that there's

903
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
possibly not a strong bearish order

904
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
block there we would look for a

905
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,240
rejection block which is a movement

906
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
above the candles bodies if there's long

907
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
wicks that top that market

908
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,919
and then ultimately a run above the old

909
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,919
high or return to a historical low the

910
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,440
same things we just outlined for the

911
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,679
monthly is seen for the weekly both

912
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,000
premium and discount the same hierarchy

913
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,520
and how you would expect to see these

914
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,600
arrays occur in price action

915
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
this is the way they are seen

916
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,679
and obviously the same thing is said for

917
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,080
a daily chart nothing's changed the same

918
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,399
hierarchy exists

919
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,480
if we're at equilibrium

920
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
and that's the current market action

921
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,640
price and we're expecting lower prices

922
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
the first thing we want to look for in

923
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,200
the left side of our chart is there any

924
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,640
mitigation blocks or a bullish breaker

925
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
if there is anything less than that

926
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,039
breaker probably won't be considered or

927
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,399
retreated to

928
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,000
the breaker has precedence over

929
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
everything both bullish breaker and

930
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
bearish breakers

931
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
so we're going to take a look at an

932
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,600
example of all this information with our

933
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,760
dollar yen example that we mentioned

934
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,679
briefly in lesson number five money

935
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,640
management was higher time from analysis

936
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
using these ideas

937
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,919
