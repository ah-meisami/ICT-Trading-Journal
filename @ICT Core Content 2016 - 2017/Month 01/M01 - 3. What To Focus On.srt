1
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
okay folks welcome back

2
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
this is the third teaching of a series

3
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,680
of eight for the first month of the ict

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
mentorship

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
okay we're going to continue continuing

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
on our theme of understanding the

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
mindset that you have to have

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
going into the marketplace looking at

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,000
things in a little bit reverse order

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
then you're normally taught from a

11
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,039
retail perspective

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,160
and this is one

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760
this is one of those teachings that

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,319
you're going to have that if you're new

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,560
you actually have the advantage here

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
for folks that have been trading for a

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
while that

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
have adopted bad habits or

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
an understanding or a belief that they

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
have an understanding

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
it's going to be a little bit expensive

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,040
for them because they're going to have

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,920
to

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
purge some of the things that they

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
either subscribe to or

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
wrestle with it until they either do or

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
elect not to use this insight at all

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
i mapped out a

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
a crude depiction here and i've been

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
using it for months actually um as a

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,880
teaching tool

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
but we're gonna really hammer it down in

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
this mentorship because it's imperative

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,159
that you know

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
how we as

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,320
traders are supposed to be viewing

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,159
marketplace uh data delivery um

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
reverse psychology

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
whatever the psychology of this

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
informed money is

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,280
it's going to be diametrically opposed

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
to that of the uninformed or speculative

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
money or quote unquote dumb

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
and when we have these ideas when we

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
look at price okay the first thing we

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
have to do is establish

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
who is the victim here you know

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
generally there's a victim always in

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
every crime

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
and

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
the perspective that the speculative

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
uninformed money has

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
is that number one they don't

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
acknowledge that there's a smart money

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
there is not an entity out there that

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
has uh quote unquote the right things

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
always on uh the right perspective

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
or that a market is rigged or controlled

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
or manipulated or has any influence over

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,160
long-term price delivery

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
the uninformed money

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
okay or

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
those that are uninformed in regards to

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,640
how smart money actually operates and

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
exists in the in the marketplace their

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
actual perspective really is that

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
indicators are the answer

68
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,599
and uninformed money their perspective

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
holds

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,040
belief that

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
price moves by indicators influence okay

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
and the influence of an indicator being

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,480
overbought or sold that is what the

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
precursor is to a market moving higher

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
or lower and i can tell you i subscribed

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
to that for years as a new trader and it

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
took a long time for me to actually be

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
broken away from

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
that type of mindset

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
so if you're new and you haven't been

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
exposed to indicator itis and you're not

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,159
infected with that yet you're actually

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,360
pretty good uh in in terms of advantage

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
uh those that like

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,959
to use it indicators are going to have a

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,159
little bit of a

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
struggle with this mentorship because

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
i'm telling you basically you need to

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
get that out of your system get that off

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,440
your charts because it is not how you're

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
going to be able to see smart money in

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,560
fact we're going to be able to use these

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
indicators to be

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
uh informed as to what the uninformed

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,720
traders are actually uh thinking so when

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
we talk about sentiment next month

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,280
you'll have a lot more understanding

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,519
about what that is how it's developed

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
and what you can do with it

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,760
now

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
obviously we only exposed one side of

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
the the paradigm here by

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
specifically dealing with the

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
speculative uninformed monies

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
perspective uh you're not here to really

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
so much learn about those individuals

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,798
because obviously no we all know that

108
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,839
there's a losing crowd in the

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,479
marketplace and your idea

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
of uh you know being a part of that

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
group is foolish so we're here only to

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
focus on what the smart money view is on

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
the marketplace and that begins by

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
understanding that there is a huge vast

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
enormous

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
new pool of liquidity coming into the

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,240
marketplace every single day

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
even though there's new busted accounts

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
all the time the statistics stated tell

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
us that 90 of traders lose their money

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,199
large funds are in the same category not

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
every fund is profitable just because

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
there's a lot of people that are

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,479
investing money into this fund or this

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
fund manager does not no way guarantee

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
that that fund will exist a year two

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
years five years from now

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
so we as

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
informed traders our perspective is to

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
hold the perspective of what a liquidity

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
provider or smart money view is on the

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
marketplace and they put a spotlight on

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
the aspects of uninformed money because

134
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
that's what makes the world go around in

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
the marketplace the smart money is there

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,039
to provide liquidity but they're doing

137
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
it at a exchange premium

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
in other words they're putting in in

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
trades that they're gonna most likely

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,600
come back to to either offset or

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
neutralize for their

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
interests and we'll talk more about that

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
as we go but for now understand that the

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680
smart money knows in fact that there is

145
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
a large body of uninformed money out

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,240
there contrast that with what we spoke

147
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,919
of concerning the uninformed money's

148
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
perspective is there's a lack of an

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
entity out there that has a smart money

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
perspective on the price they don't have

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
an opinion or

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
an idea based

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
uh perspective that there is someone or

154
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
some entity or entities out there that

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
have a smart money perspective

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,919
or that the banks would actually

157
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,520
you know trade against

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
large uh firms or funds that that goes

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,800
against the grain of what a free market

160
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,639
is

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
so when we have a smart money

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
perspective in the marketplace we

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
actually use

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
their perspective as everybody else is

165
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
liquidity

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
and price is delivered to engineer

167
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
efficiency for the smart money entities

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,960
only

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
it's not anything outside that

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,280
so to hold the perspective of a

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,600
liquidity provider you are adopting a

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
smart money perspective and everybody

173
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,880
else

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,319
is liquidity

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
and the liquidity is going to be in the

176
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
form of buy stops sell stops pending

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
orders above and below the market highs

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
that are most recently

179
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
formed on your charts

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
once we understand that there's two

181
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,479
distinct perspectives that's what

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
creates the market efficiency paradigm

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
both of

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
both groups okay have

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
their individual perspectives

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
the one that is smart money they have

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
the unique perspective of understanding

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
already what the uninformed money is

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
going to believe about the marketplace

190
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,240
and that gives them their edge on top of

191
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
that they're actually in control of

192
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,479
price just like anything else if you own

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,000
a storefront or if you're owning a

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
business and your commodity is sold who

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
sets the price for that commodity you

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,319
you're the store owner well currency is

197
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
owned by the bank and they set the price

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
on the value of that bank note or that

199
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,960
digit on your screen that says you have

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,960
xyz number of dollars in or francs or

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
pounds or whatever it is that you're uh

202
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
you measuring your currency in

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
that's east that value is set by the

204
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,960
central bank that has printed that money

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
and why this is such a uh

206
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
speed bump for people's understanding

207
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
is beyond me because if you look at the

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,639
state of the world we're in right now

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
obviously corruption and deceit is the

210
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
name of the game so

211
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,199
it's not a shock to hear if you first

212
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
time being exposed to this that the

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
central banks are in absolute control of

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
what their price of their currency is

215
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
and they can set it at any time at any

216
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
price they want don't believe me look at

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
what they did with the swiss franc and

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
the euro when it was d-pegged

219
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,960
instantaneous wipeout okay

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
so once we understand both perspectives

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
okay intimately okay we no longer have a

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,639
at odds

223
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,560
perspective on the marketplace we don't

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
vilify the market maker we don't vilify

225
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
smart money we don't beat up or

226
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,958
make fun of the uninformed money in fact

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
what we do is we find a balance in

228
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,719
between that and we don't think in terms

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
of victim or aggressor we just think in

230
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
terms of efficiency because the markets

231
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
are always going to trade in an

232
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,680
efficient manner but it's slanted and

233
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
more prone

234
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,080
to lace the pockets of the smart money

235
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,279
because they have the advantage of

236
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,800
pricing wherever they want price to go

237
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
to and they already know what the

238
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
perspective is of the uninformed money

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
and they also know how to manipulate

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
that perspective at any given time based

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
on chart patterns based on indicators

242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
based on just reactions to market news

243
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
now as we go through this mentorship

244
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
we're going to be focusing primarily on

245
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
your understanding of these four primary

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
drivers in price delivery it's

247
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
retracement expansion reversal and

248
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
consolidation now we're not going to

249
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
talk specifically about that but i want

250
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,399
you to understand that all the things

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
we're teaching here they're all

252
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,760
frameworks for you to understand those

253
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
four general principles

254
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
we can't

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
teach specific

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,040
contexts or

257
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
topics without having a broad based

258
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
understanding of foundation and that's

259
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,279
what this entire month of september is

260
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
doing it brings everybody to a reference

261
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
point to start at the same location some

262
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
of you that are advanced that watch a

263
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
lot of my free tutorials over the years

264
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
you need to put that aside for a moment

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
and start with this perspective in mind

266
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
and i promise you it's going to deliver

267
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
everything that you skipped over we're

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,720
going to fill in all those gaps

269
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
but understanding that the interbank

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,600
price delivery algorithm okay to

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
understand that it's going to have to

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
come by exposure and exposure creates

273
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
experience that experience is going to

274
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
give you the understanding going into

275
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,640
the charts seeing what they ex what they

276
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
should be doing with price what you

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
should be seeing in price

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
by seeing each individual component

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
explained in detail and context

280
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
each individual part or component of the

281
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
hole will be able to dovetail nicely and

282
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
you'll understand how everything fits

283
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
together but suppress that desire to

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
feel like you have to have techniques

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,279
and and

286
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
patterns and

287
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
intricate secrets about how the chart

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
does this or chart does that

289
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,399
you have to have the framework in mind

290
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
and the foundation of why these things

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
exist otherwise all those little things

292
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,120
ain't going to make any sense to you

293
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,399
when i'm calling on you to refer to them

294
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,399
so with all that

295
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,240
what specifically should you be focusing

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
on right now as a new student in this

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,839
mentorship

298
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
the first thing you need to know is

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,279
there are

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,040
very little things you should be

301
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,240
bringing into your expectations and what

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
your

303
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
understanding should be

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
in other words basically what i'm saying

305
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
is you need to have

306
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
no previous knowledge brought in with

307
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,680
this

308
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
kind of like put everything aside and

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
assume it's very difficult for those who

310
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
have already gone through

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,079
different disciplines of trading

312
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,000
because they have to try to forget what

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,279
they already know

314
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
and even if they've made money with it

315
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,839
which is the worst thing that could have

316
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
ever happened is if anything outside of

317
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
institutional order flow led to your

318
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
profitability it really was just

319
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
coincidence and coincidence can happen

320
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,600
for a long time i did it for nine months

321
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
and was all pure luck and then it no

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
longer worked again so

323
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,519
understanding right now what it is

324
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,720
specifically you're supposed to be doing

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
that's important as a new mentor student

326
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
the first thing you need to be doing is

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
creating a daily price action log with

328
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
price charts

329
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
now i know some of you don't want to do

330
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,639
this some of you have resisted me uh

331
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,720
telling you for years to do this but i'm

332
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
telling you you all are here and you've

333
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
paid for this mentorship you paid for

334
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
the understanding and expecting

335
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
experience that i've gained over the

336
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
last 23 plus years

337
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
i can tell you

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
how i got it was doing the very things

339
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
i'm going to tell you to do in this

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
specific video it starts here if you

341
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
skip this video if you skip what i'm

342
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
teaching you in this video if you ignore

343
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
what i'm telling you what to do in

344
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
regards to what specific things you

345
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
should start with right now it does not

346
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
mean okay just because you've been

347
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,399
trading longer than anybody else and

348
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,920
because you have i understand what

349
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,279
optimal trade entry is because you

350
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
understand what an order block bullish

351
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,480
embarrasses before because you

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
understand what a liquidity void is that

353
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
is not an advantage okay you need to go

354
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
back to square one and understand that

355
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
this is strength in your development if

356
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
you don't do these types of things

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
you're actually going to hurt your

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
development you're going to hurt and

359
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
stunt your growth throughout this

360
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,200
mentorship

361
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
so

362
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,839
go back to square one you're the new

363
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
student do everything that's been

364
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
described here and advise because this

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
is where the money starts coming in if

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
you have these things in place and you

367
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,839
start right at this very core principle

368
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
it will develop we're going to be

369
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
focusing on this throughout the entire

370
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,120
12 months every month we're going to

371
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,839
build on what rules and what things that

372
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,959
you're supposed to be looking for in the

373
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
charts but for right now primarily the

374
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,720
only thing i want you to be doing is

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
starting with a daily chart

376
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
okay your daily chart needs to show 12

377
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
months no less than nine months view you

378
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,240
have to have that much perspective on

379
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,560
your chart don't have so much of a

380
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
perspective you have multiple years on

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
your chart

382
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
12 months to nine months ideally

383
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
okay you have a four hour chart and your

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
four hour chart needs to have three

385
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,399
months of price action viewed

386
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
the 60 minute chart or one hour chart

387
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
has to have at least three weeks view

388
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
and the 15 minute chart needs to have at

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
least three to four days view that means

390
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
for every chart here i'm recommending a

391
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,040
specific amount of data that needs to be

392
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,279
displayed for that respective time frame

393
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
what you need to resist doing right now

394
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
is you need to resist the urge to

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
forecast price movements that's not for

396
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
your stage of development right now

397
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,160
do not try to rush ahead and try to

398
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
figure out what the market's going to do

399
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
next because that's going to be a

400
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
problem for you and it's only going to

401
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
lead to frustration we will get you

402
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
there and it's going to happen in due

403
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
time but for now resist that urge but

404
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
there are some things you need to be

405
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
specifically dealing with these charts

406
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
you need to note where

407
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
price shown a quick movement from a

408
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,279
specific level in other words if it's

409
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,959
run quickly higher or lower from a

410
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,040
particular level that's noteworthy you

411
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
need to note that on your chart you need

412
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
to also note recent highs and lows that

413
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,959
haven't been retested that means if a

414
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,519
high's formed on your chart if the price

415
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,040
has not come back up to that level in

416
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
recent time okay you need to make a

417
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,079
special note of that because it's going

418
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,519
to probably be influential going in the

419
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,079
future vice versa just contrarily

420
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,440
speaking you're going to be able to look

421
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
for the lows that have formed that have

422
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,839
not been recently traded to and that low

423
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,240
will be influential later on in future

424
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,120
price delivery as well

425
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
note areas on the charts where price has

426
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
left clean highs and clean lows

427
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,199
basically that looks like two equal

428
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
highs that formed in

429
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
close proximity to one another um

430
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,720
when we whenever we see a high go

431
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
up and form and then it trades away from

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,079
that for a little while and comes right

433
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
back to it and doesn't make a new high

434
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
or maybe it falls just a little bit

435
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
shorter just a little bit above it

436
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,639
i note that as a clean high and usually

437
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,320
buy stops will form above that and the

438
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
market will usually come back up there

439
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,199
and run through that

440
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
it doesn't mean it won't continue

441
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,519
through it but it's usually a big

442
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,680
bullseye for a price to want to go up

443
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
into that area and the reverse is said

444
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,320
for double bottoms or equal lows when a

445
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,639
low is formed and another low is equally

446
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,560
formed in close proximity to the initial

447
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,360
one

448
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,240
that's a big area for sell stops to pull

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
or build up underneath those lows and

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,160
the market tends to have a willingness

451
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
to go down there and test that liquidity

452
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,240
that means the market will go down into

453
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
that area whether it continues to go

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
lower or if it goes down and then

455
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
reverses there's conditions that we look

456
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
for to frame all that and you will know

457
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
when to expect the specific conditions

458
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,680
but for now i want you to start

459
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
practicing looking for that in your

460
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
charts and having them noted on your

461
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
chart

462
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
note what days the highs and the lows

463
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,199
form

464
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,399
and

465
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
this is for the weekly range and you

466
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
want to know what time of day that

467
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
occurs what kill zone is it the high and

468
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,880
low of the

469
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,680
week forming in london or is it forming

470
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
in new york because all those things are

471
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,959
going to lend well to

472
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
prognostication and what should happen

473
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,480
going forward

474
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,079
and you want to note the daily high and

475
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
the daily low every single trading day

476
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
and you want to note when the daily high

477
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
and the daily low forms for every

478
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
individual

479
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,799
uh trading day

480
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,240
now what does that look like well it

481
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,839
starts off with a bare bones chart this

482
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,000
is a daily chart and i'm using the swiss

483
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
franc here it could be any chart any

484
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
pair but you want to start with one

485
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,039
currency pair and then it's mentorship

486
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
you want to specifically deal with one

487
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
i would recommend you doing something

488
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
apart from the british pound and the

489
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
euro only because you're going to see me

490
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
specifically dealing with that

491
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
in this individual mentorship but you

492
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
want to be doing something with a

493
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
currency pair that is not being utilized

494
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
in this mentorship that way you're

495
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
getting a unique perspective that you

496
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
yourself have arrived at

497
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
using this as a guideline

498
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,400
but the first thing you want to do is

499
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,919
obviously note the most recent highs in

500
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,919
the recent lows where markets have

501
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
shown a willingness to repel from that's

502
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,679
the first thing you want to note because

503
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
this is how you identify order blocks

504
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,440
this is how you identify liquidity voids

505
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
this is all the beginning frameworks of

506
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,480
that but you need to be able to note

507
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
those recent highs and recent lows

508
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,919
that's what's been done for you here

509
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
next you're going to drop down into a

510
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
four hour chart and those same levels of

511
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
this noted on the daily chart are shown

512
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,720
here

513
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
and there's more highs and more lows

514
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,039
that come into visibility by doing a

515
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,440
lower time frame perspective we went

516
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
from again

517
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
the chart was a daily chart before

518
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
now we're looking at the same levels

519
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,840
just

520
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,440
drop down into a four-hour chart those

521
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,760
levels will be transposed immediately to

522
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
what the four-hour chart shows then you

523
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
go through doing the same thing you're

524
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
looking for areas where it's too clean

525
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,919
equal highs and equal lows and close

526
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
proximity to one another and you look

527
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
for where the market has moved quickly

528
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
away from a particular level when it

529
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
creates these real big candles or bars

530
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
okay on your chart you want to note that

531
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,919
because they're going to be influential

532
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,520
in your expectations of where price

533
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,280
should go and where they should not go

534
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
you're going to go down to an hourly

535
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
chart okay an hourly chart you're going

536
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
to be looking at

537
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,919
individual

538
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
days okay over a course of one or two

539
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
weeks and

540
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,919
you can get the weekly range

541
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
defined with the hourly chart and you

542
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,080
can look at the intraday highs and lows

543
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,440
with an hour already charge a really

544
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,559
good bellwether chart if you're a

545
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,120
short-term trader or a day trader that's

546
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
like the daily chart for uh you know the

547
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,880
barometer whether you should be a buyer

548
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
or seller and we'll teach all those

549
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,000
things all those instant details will be

550
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
taught in this mentorship for now you'll

551
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
be taking all those levels you found on

552
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,799
the daily chart the four hour and

553
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,200
transposing those to an hourly chart

554
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
now you want to keep this chart

555
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
okay in this format

556
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
separate from all the other charts that

557
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
i'm going to talk about now okay

558
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
anything else we talk about in terms of

559
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
what we're specifically looking for

560
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,679
they don't get utilized on the same

561
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,880
chart you create another chart so you're

562
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,400
going to have two individual independent

563
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,160
us swissy

564
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
charts okay but you're going to carry

565
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
the information on two separate charts

566
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
that way you don't have charts that are

567
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
too busy have too many things on there

568
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
and you get confused and all kinds of

569
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,919
things that we're worrying about then

570
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,000
you'll kind of create another swiss

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
franc chart okay and for that you're

572
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
going to use a 15-minute chart and when

573
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,760
it's loaded obviously it's going to be

574
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
naked bare nothing on there and the

575
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,039
15-minute chart looks like a lot of

576
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,080
noise it doesn't give you any

577
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,679
perspective without any frames of

578
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,080
reference and you want to take

579
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,000
the course of action we talked about

580
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
using the daily the four hour in

581
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
one hour chart do that same thing with

582
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,840
the

583
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
individual 15 minute chart but you only

584
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
need to be applying it to the last 15

585
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,039
i'm sorry last

586
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,520
three days three to four days and using

587
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
those reference points in the last three

588
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
to four days on a 15-minute chart

589
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,679
okay you're gonna be looking at also the

590
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
daily highs and the daily lows and you

591
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
can see this is how i do my charts on a

592
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
15-minute basis you're actually going to

593
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,919
see me actually do this very practice

594
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,240
every single day going forward starting

595
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,600
with this week that we're going to enter

596
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
into the mentorship

597
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
i note the previous days highs in the

598
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
previous days lows and then draw them

599
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,000
out to where zero gmt is which is eight

600
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
o'clock in that evening time in my time

601
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,400
frame and in this delivery

602
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
of data with this platform

603
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
this is how i know my daily highs and

604
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,320
daily lows it's important to note also

605
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
the days of the week now i'm not going

606
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
to give you all the specifics here

607
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,280
because you're actually going to be

608
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
watching me do it on a day-to-day basis

609
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
so you'll be able to get a rough idea

610
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,000
in this tutorial but more specifically

611
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,440
you can actually see me actually

612
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
creating documents

613
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
for my individual

614
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,640
record keeping so you're going to see

615
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
actually how i do my charts how i log

616
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
them and yes even after 23 years of

617
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
trading i still do this

618
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
it's important to do it it's

619
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
understanding it's clarity it gives you

620
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,000
perspective and it's what professionals

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
do sorry it's just there's no way around

622
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,000
it the folks that are really

623
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
concerned about the market they have

624
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
logs they keep journals these are the

625
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,880
types of things they do

626
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
if you notice real quick why noting the

627
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
previous day's highs in previous days

628
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
lows if you look at wednesday's data

629
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,159
okay

630
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
you see the little

631
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
delineation where it says wednesday if

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
you look at the previous day obviously

633
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
it would be tuesday in the course of a

634
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,039
normal week

635
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,520
the high that was formed on tuesday

636
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,280
on wednesday price came right up there

637
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,559
and ran through that around the 97 90

638
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,360
level

639
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
uh notice it did not continue through

640
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
that it just went up through the

641
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
previous days or tuesday's high

642
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
then it sold off

643
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
when it sold off

644
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
it went all the way down where did it go

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
down to just any old level it went down

646
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
to tuesday's low just breaching it by a

647
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
pip or two and then came back off into

648
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,440
consolidation

649
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
then look at what happened on thursday

650
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
thursday we had price retraced back into

651
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
the range that was created from

652
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,080
wednesday's high down into wednesday's

653
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
low

654
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
thursday starts today with trading and

655
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,760
consolidation it rallies up closes in a

656
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
range

657
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,280
okay that was formed from wednesday's

658
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
high and wednesday's low then it sells

659
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
off and where does it sell off to

660
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
moving just below

661
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
then it pulls off that low and goes into

662
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
consolidation

663
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
then we have friday

664
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
the market just goes straight on up

665
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
rolls right on through

666
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,360
thursday's high

667
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
and creating a new high prior to friday

668
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
the weekly high was formed on wednesday

669
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,480
it ran out the stops and all the

670
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
liquidity that would be resting above

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,520
wednesday's high

672
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,400
all done on friday so we're going to be

673
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,919
using these reference points and giving

674
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
you a lot more insight

675
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
about specifics and what you're doing

676
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
with it but for now i want you to know

677
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,679
that this is what you're going to be

678
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,720
doing

679
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,480
going forward every single trading day

680
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
you're going to document price action

681
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,679
you're going to build on your

682
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,880
understanding

683
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
every month i give you more reference

684
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,159
points to add to your charts and why

685
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
it's important what specific what the

686
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
information will do for you what uh

687
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
with advantages it gives to you by

688
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,720
having it and

689
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,039
by having your charts very uniformly

690
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
organized like this

691
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,480
when you're trading

692
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
your chart is going to have its

693
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,720
independent uh analysis you're not going

694
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
to have all these things on your chart

695
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
but these charts are always going to be

696
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
referred to while you're watching price

697
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,720
because

698
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,200
by having three charts okay because

699
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,559
you're gonna have one that's executable

700
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,840
in other words what you're watching on

701
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
the setup right now because you never

702
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
want to marry the ideas that you have in

703
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
your analysis you need to reflect on

704
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
them but you don't want to be so cast

705
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
iron can't do it any other way it has to

706
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
be that way otherwise if you're watching

707
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,159
real-time price action if you see

708
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
something that doesn't make sense for

709
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,919
what the underlying conditions that

710
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,120
you're expecting occurs in the

711
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,320
marketplace

712
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
you won't have the flexibility to switch

713
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
gears or go to the sidelines you'll just

714
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
hold on to the market with strong

715
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,320
conviction and that that's imposing your

716
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
will that the market's going to do what

717
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,039
they're going to do and it's not going

718
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
to happen because you want it to happen

719
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,679
it's going to happen because it's going

720
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
to happen and we try to get in sync with

721
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
what the market's going to do whether

722
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
it's going to be moving sideways whether

723
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,320
it's going to go higher whether it's

724
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,159
going to lower we don't know any of

725
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,960
those uh directions with a great deal

726
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
of certainty we just know probabilities

727
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
and but we know how to go into the

728
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
marketplace looking for these types of

729
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
things over and over and over again they

730
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,799
repeat and you'll be able to find those

731
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,760
repeating

732
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,000
uh occurrences in price action after

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,480
going through this mentorship
