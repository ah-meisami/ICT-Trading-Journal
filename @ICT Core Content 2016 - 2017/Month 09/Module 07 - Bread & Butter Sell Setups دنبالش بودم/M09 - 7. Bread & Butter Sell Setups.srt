1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,179
foreign

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
welcome back folks to lesson six of the

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
May 2017 ICT mentorship

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,400
ICT amplify day trading and scalping

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,439
this teaching is bread and butter by

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,039
setups

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660
okay bread and butter buy setups daily

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,120
opportunities in scalping

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,219
now what you're going to be focusing on

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,340
is consistent small price movements that

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,719
can be harvested

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,480
not every day but just about every day

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,860
now in buy programs ifta will perform

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,960
one of two price engine models

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,340
the first is accumulate sell side

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,420
liquidity by repricing under an old low

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,940
cell stops will be triggered inducing

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,619
counterparty sellers to pair long

19
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,140
entries with

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,600
price will seek a higher short-term

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
premium array to offset positions so

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,820
offset accumulation is the first price

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,360
engine model

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,280
the second is re-accumulate fair value

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,240
in retracements lower at discount arrays

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,119
week-long holders will be squeezed in

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,740
the retracement lower so otherwise

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,479
anyone that's already long

29
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,000
when you see the retracement intraday

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,579
many Traders are usually using way too

31
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,680
tight of a stop loss and they'll be

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
squeezed out and I'll be providing

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,299
short-term sell-side liquidity to pair

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,700
up orders with

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220
and price will seek to expand higher to

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,380
a short-term premium array to offset

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,979
positions

38
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,200
all right engineering sell side

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,579
liquidity

40
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
offset accumulation

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,520
ifta Will reprice the Market below an

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
old low to promote sell stops that will

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
be residing there for current

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,639
longholders now this is in essence

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,739
Engineers sellers at a deep discount

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,360
price

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
the open float which is the existing

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
orders that are actually in the

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,099
marketplace above and below the current

50
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,239
market price

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,060
the open Flow below that old low may

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,920
also have cell stops for breakout

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,860
systems that wish to sell on weakness

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,700
this model is called offset accumulation

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,500
its primary purpose is to offset current

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,319
long holders or induce more sellers at

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,940
discount pricing the model is seen

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,680
frequently in bullish market conditions

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,760
and while higher time frame

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,620
institutional order flow is suggesting

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,160
higher prices

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,420
typically offset accumulation models

63
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,459
unfold quickly and you must learn to

64
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,720
anticipate them at Key lows intraday

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,900
thank you

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,500
all right providing Banks new long

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,620
entry points or pricing

68
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,379
with reaccumulation

69
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,300
if they will reprice the market lower to

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
a fair value price array to provide

71
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,019
smart money discount pricing for long

72
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:10,980
entries

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,840
the market will be bullish from an

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,220
Institutional perspective and many times

75
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,200
unfolds after a recent sell stop rate

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,540
the retracement lower in price will

77
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,360
place pain on current long holders and

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
tends to induce selling thus providing

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,739
sell side liquidity to pair smart money

80
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,379
long entries with

81
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,959
this model is called re-accumulation its

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,060
primary purpose is to reaccumulate new

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
long entries and or induce more sellers

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,080
at discount pricing

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,000
the model is seen frequently in bullish

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
market conditions and while higher time

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,060
frame institutional order flow is

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,400
suggesting higher prices

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,620
typically reaccumulation models unfold

90
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,540
quickly and you must learn to anticipate

91
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,400
them at Key discount arrays intraday

92
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,019
okay realistic objectives

93
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,760
the trade duration when we look for

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,040
scalps are going to be typically one to

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
two hours or less many times a lot less

96
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,900
but usually about two hours is the

97
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,120
maximum

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,739
Pips portrayed

99
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,540
usually you're going to see a low end of

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,760
15 Pips to 30 Pips on average

101
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,079
timing the market we're gonna be using

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,040
the five minute chart

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,259
now the frequency of setups

104
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,020
per week you get as many as 15 or more

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,440
yes 15 or more

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
per day you get about two to three

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,080
setups typically

108
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,759
per session you generally get about one

109
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,919
per session that means

110
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,560
one in London one in New York one in

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
London close and one in Asia doesn't

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,940
mean you get one every single session

113
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,979
for every single pair it just means if

114
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,259
you look across a handful of pairs get a

115
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,600
basket of four or five you can watch and

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,639
see that there's a scalp usually setting

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,020
up in one of these sessions and one of

118
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,639
those pairs or another there's going to

119
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,840
be more volatility in one pair over

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,520
there so if you look at for instance the

121
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
the majors across the dollar

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
if you look at all those Majors paired

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,419
with the dollar if you look at every

124
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,419
major at London obviously London's so

125
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,800
volatile you'll get something there

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,780
obviously but New York the same thing

127
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,660
but usually running clothes in Asia both

128
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,100
will have uh something crop up in either

129
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,460
one of those major uh crosses with the

130
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,800
dollar but not all of them just one of

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,979
them

132
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,940
now you risk the reward typically it's

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,320
going to be one to one which isn't hot

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,060
but sometimes you can get a little bit

135
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,100
better than that but generally if you're

136
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,440
thinking scalping think one to one and

137
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,660
that's about all you're gonna get

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,400
ideal risk for trade is a half percent

139
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
to one percent and one percent may be a

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,780
little high but as you start to get

141
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,039
better at it you can start seeing more

142
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,060
setups

143
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
and obviously you can graduate to the

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,699
one percent but I wouldn't do anything

145
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,100
more than that

146
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
now this is the offset accumulation

147
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,020
model basically it's a stop run on Cell

148
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,979
stops

149
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,820
the buy profile

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,320
for offset accumulation so in other

151
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
words this engineering sell side

152
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,740
liquidity knocking out cell stops to

153
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,400
take it higher

154
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,440
and for reaccumulation using fair value

155
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,620
or reaccumulation by profile

156
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,539
for the price engine model this is what

157
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,800
it is it's typically the optimal trade

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,160
entry

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
all right consistent small price

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,960
movements are going to be specific to

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,479
kill zones all scalping should be done

162
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,280
during ICT kill zones

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
since the duration and style of trading

164
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,419
is so short-term in nature we need the

165
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,860
most volatile times of the trading day

166
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,319
to ensure that we get a move

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,139
there are times when using limit orders

168
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,560
an entry May execute outside a Kill Zone

169
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,180
this tends to happen in London lunch

170
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,100
that means between 5 a.m New York time

171
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,380
to 7 A.M New York time

172
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,960
or Post New York open basically around

173
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,900
10 o'clock and later in the afternoon

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,759
so it's best to be actively following

175
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,660
the market if you're going to be

176
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,460
scalping yesterday in other words what

177
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,479
am I saying

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,520
try to do all your scalping with Market

179
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,340
orders you can get fancy if you want to

180
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,979
with limit orders but my opinion is if

181
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,720
you're going to be scalping just use

182
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
Market orders just get in there use

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,660
Market hours and use limit orders for

184
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,919
your exits

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll give you here a little

186
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,780
chart for the major sessions and you can

187
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,699
see how they overlap with GMT time and

188
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,599
Eastern Standard Time

189
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,560
the kill zones aren't

190
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,660
completely lined up with this so you

191
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
have to use the lesson that gave you in

192
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,500
earlier months where I actually give you

193
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,780
the specifics about what each killzone's

194
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,979
time start and end is

195
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
all right up close days or bullish days

196
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
and we're gonna be revisiting the daily

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,539
range here for completeness sake

198
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,919
when the market is poised to trade

199
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,780
higher based on higher time frame

200
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,660
institutional order flow in essence we

201
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,060
expect the open to be at or near the low

202
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,900
of the daily range

203
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,120
there can be a small decline below the

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,160
opening price so you're probably asking

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,020
yourself well Michael what's the opening

206
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
price you're referring to remember we

207
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,280
look at both zero GMT open at age is

208
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,319
open and we're looking at midnight in

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,340
New York

210
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,020
so higher time frame institutional order

211
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,139
flow that means that monthly weekly

212
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,599
Daily 4 Hour we've done our analysis

213
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,060
we've done all of our

214
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,280
directional bias studies we looked at

215
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
the iptodata ranges where is the

216
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,899
quarterly shift most recently is it

217
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,159
looking to go higher it's looking to go

218
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,159
lower are we recently trading off of

219
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,179
daily bullish discount arrays are we

220
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,380
seeing bullish order block support

221
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,420
pricing bearish order blocks breaking

222
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,700
away are we coming down and filling in

223
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,160
liquidity voids and rallying or are we

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,260
filling in Fair gaps and rallying what

225
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,519
that's telling you is institutional

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,860
overflow is bullish you don't need trend

227
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,480
lines for moving averages to do that and

228
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
you just need to see what price is doing

229
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,800
how is it supporting

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,839
are up candles up close candles being

231
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,680
broken

232
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,839
and down closed candles finding support

233
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,360
for every time price comes down to it

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
that's institutional order flow so if

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,839
you're looking at it on a higher time

236
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,459
frame monthly weekly daily or four hour

237
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,880
and you see those evidences in price and

238
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,680
you did your PDA array Matrix and you

239
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,200
see where those PD arrays are where's

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,180
the one that you're mostly most likely

241
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,680
going to see

242
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,500
facilitate a long entry it's the next

243
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
one that price trades to once you get in

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,459
there obviously you're gonna be looking

245
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,440
for something as a premium

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,660
to be counterparty to so that way it

247
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
frames your trade you have to have an

248
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,959
entry point you have to have number one

249
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,040
you have to have a consensus of whether

250
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
the Market's bullish or bearish and we

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,279
don't use anything except for

252
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,200
institutional workflow to get that that

253
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
means we're looking at Price action that

254
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,399
tell us what's what's occurring our old

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,980
highs breaking but lows not being broken

256
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,740
or are those lows being broken quickly

257
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,660
and the price snaps higher right away

258
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,360
what that's showing you is the price

259
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,339
engine model was reaccumulation they

260
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,660
took it down took the cell stops

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,760
announced going higher these are all

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
fingerprints or Hallmarks of ipta

263
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
showing institutional order flow is

264
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,839
bullish

265
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,380
London open posts the initial leg higher

266
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,899
intraday then waits for New York open

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,519
typically you'll see that London Open

268
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,899
Swing

269
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,060
pretty volatile pretty aggressive move

270
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
one-sided

271
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,360
and usually does about anywhere between

272
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,760
40 and 60 of the daily range

273
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,740
before we get to 5 a.m New York time

274
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,040
and then there's a small period between

275
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
5 a.m and 7 A.M which is the London

276
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
lunch and usually you'll get some

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,579
measure of retracement or consolidation

278
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,680
there

279
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,500
and then you have the New York open so

280
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
New York open sees a continuation higher

281
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,860
when we're bullish

282
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,339
it usually tends to expand up to 10 a.m

283
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,320
New York time usually it'll start to

284
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,140
consolidate there or

285
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,480
create the high of the day and retrace a

286
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
little bit or it could be a complete

287
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,500
Market reversal but in this case what

288
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,640
we're looking for is bullish

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,839
environments for the higher time frame

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,940
institutional workflow is bullish and

291
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,339
we're expecting a big range day where we

292
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,480
can get some scalping done

293
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,800
price should trade up into the five day

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,260
average daily Range High now that's a

295
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,180
little indicator I can give you it'll be

296
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,339
attached to the Forum so that way you

297
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,079
can download it I'm not going to give it

298
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,180
to you until we do the

299
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,399
Bread Butter cell setups so that way

300
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,019
you'll have a complete understand what

301
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:34,920
you're going to do with it because I'll

302
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,779
give you an additional instructions

303
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,959
about that in the cell setup teaching

304
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,720
and once the 5-day average daily range

305
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,459
is hit and then we go into London close

306
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,600
time of day

307
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,640
usually the price will be posting its

308
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,800
high and then it'll start retracing off

309
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,019
of that high so between 10 a.m and noon

310
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,240
in New York time we expect a high of the

311
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,740
daily range to form

312
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,500
and at or above the five-day average

313
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
daily range projected High

314
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,420
price will normally retrace lower and

315
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,220
close off of the high of the day now

316
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,399
normally does it mean every time

317
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,620
okay some of the folks in our membership

318
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,360
okay take a statement that is not highly

319
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,680
specific and rigorous about its uh

320
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,800
uh context okay it's

321
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,680
a normal thing but doesn't mean it's a

322
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,500
Panacea okay it's not a be all involved

323
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,480
it's not a absolute

324
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,240
price will normally

325
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,519
retrace lower and close off the high of

326
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,420
the day

327
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,920
what am I supposing there without

328
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,560
actually saying it it can go higher

329
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,500
sometimes can go a lot higher so just be

330
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,899
mindful that while we understand the

331
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,660
daily range is typically formed like

332
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,899
this on highly explosive up moves

333
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,940
10 o'clock isn't going to stop price 11

334
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,440
o'clock is going to stop price noon

335
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
isn't going to stop price one o'clock is

336
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,560
going to stop price it can rally all up

337
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,660
to bond close at 3 P.M in New York time

338
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,420
all right the London open we're gonna be

339
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,399
scalping the London session

340
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,760
over some details about that

341
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,380
obviously when the higher time frame

342
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,180
institutional overflow is bullish we're

343
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,560
going to be anticipating the London

344
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,639
session low of the day formation

345
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,459
the open at zero GMT or 12 a.m in New

346
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,860
York can see a protraction phase lower

347
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,060
in price

348
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,700
this can be scalped from the open or

349
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,519
just above it prior to the 1am New York

350
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,800
time now what am I saying here you can

351
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
look at Price action on a bullish day

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,440
and if you're going to be scalping

353
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
you're going to be really Nimble about

354
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,019
this you got to know exactly what you're

355
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,000
looking for for a discount array in

356
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,019
other words you're going to really be

357
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,920
confident

358
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
that your convictions are

359
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,779
so strong that you think that when price

360
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,079
drops down to create that Judah swing

361
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,240
creating the low of the day where you're

362
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,380
going to be getting out at and where the

363
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,940
opening is if there's a large enough

364
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,639
range there that can be scalped

365
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,920
I teach people not to try to do that but

366
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,860
more

367
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,820
appropriate would be to wait for the Jew

368
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,800
to swing and then buy it down there okay

369
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,120
but

370
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,220
for scalping some some of you guys are

371
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,620
really excited about being Nimble in and

372
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,480
out both sides of the marketplace again

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,459
I'm I'm not trying to promote that idea

374
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,560
but I'm just giving you a complete array

375
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
of tools and guidelines I I came up

376
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
through the market using all these

377
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,399
things but I gravitated away from doing

378
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,139
that just highly specifically looking

379
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,079
for the Judas swing down on days that's

380
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,579
bullish and I expect it to be up close

381
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,440
I'm trying to nail down that low we'll

382
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,459
get real close to that low

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
the classic London Judas swing lower can

384
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
be scalped even easier if you're looking

385
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,260
at the midnight candle in New York uh

386
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,240
that move that drops down from that

387
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,860
candle that in my opinion is a little

388
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,540
bit easier to scalp even if you're going

389
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,240
to be seeing a higher close on the day

390
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,100
but age is open that can be a little bit

391
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,240
tricky because you can have a really

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,980
tight Asian range and it doesn't do

393
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,720
anything

394
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,360
the market retraces between 5 a.m and 7

395
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
A.M New York time and this can provide a

396
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,860
long scalp entry

397
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,740
once a discount array is hit

398
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,500
now think about this hormone

399
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,060
there's times when we looked at the

400
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,459
price and after the London Kill Zone

401
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,440
closes okay and there's that little

402
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,360
quiet period of time okay where my

403
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,279
Rockets generally go quiet and it's in

404
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,860
consolidation and that's waiting for New

405
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,660
York open around seven o'clock 6 30 in

406
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,040
the morning seven o'clock in the morning

407
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
New York time is the New York session

408
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,860
open for ICT so what's going on between

409
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,920
that time it's it's the lunch but

410
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,440
just like in New York sometimes Traders

411
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
can work through lunch they can say well

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,019
the markets are really hot right now

413
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,540
I'll eat lunch when I go home so if the

414
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,760
markets are really busy many times you

415
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,980
can get a retracement

416
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,560
into the London lunch that creates an

417
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,320
early entry and it moves before New York

418
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,279
open

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,779
and that's going to happen sometimes and

420
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,220
you can get mad and cuss at the screen

421
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,040
all you want but sometimes you if you're

422
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,740
really seeing a very volatile Market in

423
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,440
London or it was quite early in London

424
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,199
and then towards the 4 30 time period

425
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,820
when news comes out then it gets really

426
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,980
active usually it'll cross over into

427
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,579
London launching you'll get maybe a

428
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,220
small little uh 15 or 30 minute

429
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,199
consolidation and then you get the

430
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
retracement back into New York and then

431
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,100
it runs but

432
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,199
not always but it's very very

433
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,180
infrequently you'll see setups that

434
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,399
occur where the entry point would be

435
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,079
really good if you're trading between 5

436
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,540
a.m and 7 A.M but it's better just to

437
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,459
not even trade that time if you're don't

438
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,259
even look at it and think that you have

439
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,839
so that having you know the expectation

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,100
there's a quiet period in the

441
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,320
marketplace which means 5 a.m and 7 A.M

442
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,000
just keep that as a general rule of

443
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,519
thumb but unless the London session is

444
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
quiet the beginning and then gets really

445
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,060
active after three o'clock or four

446
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,040
o'clock then you'll probably see a

447
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,560
little bit of bleed over into post 5 a.m

448
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
New York time

449
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,419
even after the initial Judas entry point

450
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,520
has passed that means in other words you

451
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,839
missed it you couldn't get in when it

452
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,839
dropped down many of you are too afraid

453
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,880
to get in there because I say

454
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,859
you want to be buying on the Judas swing

455
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,660
down or below the opening price and

456
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,699
don't chase price so some of you are

457
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,980
holding fast to that rule and but you

458
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,299
don't ever do anything

459
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,980
but there's opportunities if you use the

460
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,319
five minute chart you can use a scalping

461
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,059
technique to get you in sync with it now

462
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,380
the reason why I didn't teach it to you

463
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,260
sooner because it's scalping we're in

464
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,880
that time period where we can use these

465
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,960
tools now

466
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,419
up until recently we haven't even looked

467
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,039
at a five minute chart you know we were

468
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
always higher time frame and sticking to

469
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,059
the rules of each parameter for each

470
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,460
Style Trading in scouting we look at a

471
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,320
five minute chart now

472
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
I'll comment on the markets with a one

473
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,299
minute chart a few times before we close

474
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,799
this month out but generally five

475
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,880
minutes what I'm working off of

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,299
okay this is an example of a London

477
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,799
session scalp

478
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,539
okay you can see the price

479
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,400
trades back down for a fair value gap

480
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,900
for re-accumulation

481
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
fills in the gap

482
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,280
in the London open trades up

483
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
edr's hit

484
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,460
in London open

485
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,260
and it's a 30 pip scalp it goes a little

486
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,120
bit more than that obviously but that's

487
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,679
all you would be looking for for a scalp

488
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,400
and it's over done

489
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,740
scalping the New York session when

490
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,419
London opened confirms institutional

491
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,520
sponsorship on the long side and posts

492
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,100
the daily low we expect to see New York

493
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,980
open to continue higher unless a higher

494
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,080
time frame premium array has been hit

495
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,020
intraday and or ADR is reached

496
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,000
we look for intraday swings higher to

497
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,799
determine discount

498
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,500
range arrays to go long at in the New

499
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,020
York Kill Zone basically think prices

500
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,760
got to move higher then it starts to

501
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,799
retrace I think optimal trade entry long

502
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,940
okay that's basically what I'm

503
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,740
describing there so you'll be looking

504
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,360
for a discount

505
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,299
array either a bullish order block a

506
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,660
fair value Gap or a liquidity void

507
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,660
using the 8 20 am New York time for CME

508
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,940
Chicago Mercantile Exchange that's when

509
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,679
the commodity Futures contracts start

510
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,059
trading

511
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,840
open to anticipate the New York Judas

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,940
swing to fade

513
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,559
targets will be the five-day average

514
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,840
daily Range High and the next higher

515
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
time frame premium array found on a four

516
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
hour or 60 Minute basis

517
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,940
if ADR high is reached prior to 10 AM

518
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,000
take 80 off of your position

519
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,280
and leave a small portion on to capture

520
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,620
any range expansion that might fill let

521
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,360
me rephrase that again

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,179
if you're long in New York okay and you

523
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,360
have a move that's quietly moving higher

524
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,940
but it goes up and hits the average

525
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,299
daily range before 10 a.m that means it

526
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,740
fulfilled its average daily range early

527
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,140
usually London close creates the highly

528
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,539
high today but if it does it before 10

529
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,559
am

530
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,900
still take 80 of the trade off but leave

531
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,280
a small portion on there because you may

532
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
end up getting a rather large range day

533
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,120
and sometimes ADR can be doubled

534
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,679
okay so you can see an example here of

535
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,900
the New York open trade very similar in

536
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,780
the way we looked at the London open

537
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,400
price comes down fills in a fair value

538
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,220
Gap trades into orb block and that blue

539
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,919
thin line with the CME open the price

540
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,500
drops down after that that's the due to

541
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,600
swing for the New York session so that

542
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
every session has a protectionary market

543
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,080
stage

544
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,820
if you're bullish

545
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,280
in New York you're looking for 8 20 and

546
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,340
a due to swing dropping down after 8 20.

547
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,740
if you're bullish in London you're

548
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,500
looking for New York midnight candle

549
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,980
and price trading lower after that to be

550
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,140
a buyer and price should expand higher

551
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,559
in Asia it's your GMT eight o'clock in

552
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,140
the evening in my time right now if you

553
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,419
look at that session you want to see it

554
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,100
trade down

555
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,860
right after your GMT it doesn't go down

556
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,360
very much that time of day though but it

557
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
can go down just below a previous late

558
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
session swinglet like we talked about in

559
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,440
previous lessons that is the Judas swing

560
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,020
at zero GMT where age is open

561
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,140
at London close it can happen but it's

562
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,340
the opposite you're looking for the

563
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,400
range to create a for a bullish day

564
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,440
what's going to happen is it's going to

565
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,740
go up a little bit after 10 o'clock in

566
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,179
the morning so you have a line on your

567
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,039
chart vertically 10 o'clock New York

568
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
time and then the rally that takes place

569
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,039
Post 10 a.m that's the Judas swing or

570
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,419
protraction a state where it creates the

571
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:43,620
high of the day

572
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,840
and then you'll be looking to sell that

573
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,120
if you're going to be a London closed

574
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,559
Trader which we'll talk about next

575
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,360
K scalping the London clothes

576
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,980
uh before I get into this I did a

577
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,059
teaching

578
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,780
um way back I think it was in 2010

579
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,559
the uh trading the London clothes and

580
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,600
really what I gave was a lot of the

581
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,760
rules I used for my s p trading because

582
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,559
there was a lot of Trades that you can

583
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,220
take trading spoos which is s p futures

584
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,140
the uh

585
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,059
when you're trading day trading the s p

586
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,620
you're really trading two sessions the

587
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,539
morning Trend then you wait for launch

588
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,179
to go sideways or retrace and then you

589
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,539
have an afternoon Trend okay usually

590
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,539
it's about 10 30 to 11 o'clock in the

591
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,840
morning New York time that's the the end

592
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,820
of the morning session or the am trend

593
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,760
for the uh for the spoos market

594
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,860
um usually Traders go to lunch uh

595
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,080
between 11 o'clock and one o'clock and

596
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,460
that little bit after one o'clock you

597
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,620
have a PM Trend that goes into the close

598
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,820
at four o'clock

599
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,539
but the characteristics that you see for

600
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,400
London clothes for Forex is the same

601
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,580
thing that day Traders do for s p

602
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,919
so it's that time of day uh influence

603
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,140
where London Traders a trade s p they're

604
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,580
going through uh you know they're going

605
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,720
home too

606
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,419
so when the New York and London sessions

607
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,039
have moved in tandem that means they've

608
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,840
moved in the same direction and the

609
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,460
five-day average daily Range High has

610
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,880
been reached and it is at least 10 30

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,620
a.m now it's a little different now it's

612
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,320
a filter 10 30 a.m in New York time

613
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,539
expect a retracement off the day's high

614
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,200
again between 10 30 a.m and 1 p.m that's

615
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
what you're looking for for that setup

616
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
for London close

617
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,419
ideally price should exceed the five-day

618
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,520
average daily Range High it should be

619
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,039
more than what you expected to see in

620
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
the five day average daily range because

621
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,799
then you haven't really overbought

622
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,580
really stretched out range

623
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,520
look for a five minute failure swing at

624
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,740
the High and a bearish order block to

625
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,240
enter on so basically what you're doing

626
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,740
is you're waiting for it to create a

627
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,179
high start to back off and then rally

628
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,919
one more time up to it into the last up

629
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,919
candle and it has to occur between 10 30

630
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,679
a.m and 1 pm

631
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,240
you're gonna risk 10 Pips above the

632
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,740
day's high and you're going to Target 20

633
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,659
to 30 percent of the total daily range

634
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,820
in a retracement lower and I'll show you

635
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,039
what that looks like on a fib

636
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,200
keep in mind this trade can be very

637
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,659
difficult to see pan out some days as

638
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,120
the range can and could expand far more

639
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,260
than the average daily Range High

640
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,640
remember

641
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,039
the average daily range is not a

642
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,260
barrier it's not a force field it's not

643
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,179
going to stop price all we're doing is

644
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,679
getting a calculation of what's the

645
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,780
average expansion we've seen over the

646
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,220
last five days

647
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,600
well if you're looking for a big move on

648
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,159
the upside wouldn't you really expect it

649
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,620
to go beyond the average daily range and

650
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,000
that's the problem we're trying to buy

651
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
in a preconceived idea that the market

652
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,940
should go up So eventually you know if

653
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,679
we take everything off at five day

654
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,880
average daily range highs when we're

655
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,940
bullish you leave nothing on to capture

656
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,179
these double ADR days they can happen

657
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,400
so with that in mind just understand

658
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,840
that

659
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,400
just because we have both New York and

660
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
London sessions moving in tandem One

661
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,919
Direction

662
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,360
doesn't mean that there's going to be a

663
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,159
retracement of any measure that you can

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,020
trade short that's why I don't trade

665
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,760
London close anymore I used to do it a

666
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
lot but it just fell out of favor with

667
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,780
me because I just didn't get enough Pips

668
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,340
out of it or I'd get stopped out you

669
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,620
know just keep on going against me so

670
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,419
I teach it for completeness sake here

671
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,679
because I've done lessons in the past

672
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,260
but when we get an s p it's a little bit

673
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,640
more favorable trading that it's an

674
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,919
index

675
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,980
ideally take one to one risk to reward

676
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,520
targets based on required stop and try

677
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,700
to get no more than 20 Pips okay and I

678
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,820
mean that don't try to get 65 Pips or

679
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,440
don't try to get a one shot one kill

680
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,679
haul 111 close it just doesn't do it

681
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,539
um typically I should have it in my

682
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,520
notes here but it should be about 15 to

683
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,500
20 Pips if you get 20 Pips be thankful

684
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,020
moving to the sidelines

685
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,700
okay here's an example what a London

686
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,159
close looks like it comes down into an

687
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,740
enclosed time period and you want to be

688
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,620
buying it on a failure swing and you can

689
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,940
see here it actually went a little bit

690
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,400
lower and if your stop would have been

691
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
just below one or two Pips you would

692
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,919
have got knocked out but again we're

693
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,580
using uh temp hips below the low

694
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,980
and looking at the uh

695
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,400
price on not the price but the Fibonacci

696
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,020
on this chart here you can see that

697
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,640
where it says London close

698
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,620
objective that's 30 on the FIB 0.30 just

699
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,360
add that level and you'll have that and

700
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,520
point 20 is the lower level so in

701
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,320
between those two lines that's usually

702
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,779
where the market will reach up into on

703
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,640
retracements and that's a good rule of

704
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
thumb for day trading also because if

705
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,360
you haven't uh expectation the Market's

706
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,980
going to go higher and you know what the

707
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,120
average daily Range High is going to be

708
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,940
you can use that projection from the

709
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,820
daily low or the London low and draw all

710
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,100
that FIB all the way up to and anchor to

711
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,779
the five-day average daily Range High

712
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,360
well before price even gets there and

713
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
you can actually see using this 20 to 30

714
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,100
level on your FIB that's usually where

715
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,779
the close is going to be on the up close

716
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,100
day or it's going to close right on the

717
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,779
high but generally when it trades off

718
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,779
the high it'll it'll trade off the high

719
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,240
and close in between the 20 and 30

720
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,700
levels on your FIB if you add them I

721
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,960
don't keep them there I just know what

722
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,760
20 30 looks like oh my

723
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,260
my range is because I've been doing it

724
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,059
so long but for a crutch while you're

725
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,460
doing it and you learning it's a good

726
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,779
idea to have it on your uh your

727
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,980
Fibonacci that we can use it

728
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,100
okay trading the Asian or scalping the

729
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,700
Asian open

730
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,020
when the market is bullish we can enter

731
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,840
long at or just under the zero GMT

732
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,179
opening price and expect an expansion of

733
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,740
15 to 20 Pips

734
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,900
and as I said 15 to 20.

735
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,220
higher as the Asian range is established

736
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,860
Asian sessions can traditionally be very

737
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,020
narrow and while this trade has proven

738
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,120
profitable in the past nothing is

739
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
repeating in terms of promised gain so

740
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,140
what was done in the past is not

741
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,419
indicative of the future so like London

742
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,120
closed trades we are looking at the

743
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,860
lowest volatile periods of the daily

744
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,240
range formation

745
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,940
so while I'm talking about it here for

746
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,320
completeness sake and that way I'm

747
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,480
teaching you a well-versed perspective

748
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,580
on how daily ranges are formed and how

749
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,059
ifta Engineers to daily ranges using

750
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,980
time of day and the characteristics that

751
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,440
go along with them

752
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,080
Asia's opening and London close are the

753
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,260
two smallest tiny little Windows of

754
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,480
opportunity and it doesn't pay out

755
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,580
enough in my opinion to take on the risk

756
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,200
but if you just want to do observations

757
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,760
and study and you want to do some

758
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,440
crunching on the numbers

759
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,500
you have at it man but just trust me if

760
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,059
you're looking for you know more bang

761
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,740
for your buck and your study time and

762
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,360
seeing movement in price

763
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,740
you want to be focusing on the New York

764
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,380
in the month of sessions always aim for

765
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,480
15 and 20 Pips in this session as the

766
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,220
range can be limited on the basis that

767
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,659
it will be the Asian rains formation

768
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,120
remember typically we're looking for a

769
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,919
really tight narrow range on the Asian

770
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,779
range so if we're looking to be a

771
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,419
bullish buyer of the day and you're

772
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,860
trying to day trade and we think it's

773
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,419
going to go higher

774
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,360
yeah you can scout that but what you're

775
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,880
asking actually trying to do is demand

776
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,679
that the agent range pays you when you

777
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,059
really hope that it's going to be a

778
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,340
small range so it's there's a

779
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,220
confliction between the rules so

780
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,559
while you may sometimes get lucky and

781
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,659
you get expansion in the Asian range and

782
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,720
it gets like a 30 pip or 35 pip uh Asian

783
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,700
range you might get something out of it

784
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,620
my question to you is why are you

785
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,179
worried about it and you're probably

786
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,559
asking why am I including it then

787
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,260
because I'm going to get questions about

788
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,240
trading Asia I'm going to get questions

789
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,100
about what about London clothes you used

790
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,020
to do uh teaching about that yeah how

791
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,039
many times have you seen me trading

792
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
London clothes you don't see that in a

793
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
lot you don't see me doing unless it's a

794
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,740
reversal time of day if it's going to be

795
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,419
a reversal Market profile then I'm all

796
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,179
over London close same with Asia if I

797
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,740
think it's going to be trading down to a

798
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,779
level that would be a high time frame

799
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,360
discount array but it didn't quite get

800
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,240
down there in New York and it's just

801
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,980
hovering above it I would look for ages

802
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,380
opening to facilitate that entry and

803
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,700
then that would be the low of the day

804
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,760
then and start rallying up

805
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,220
take full exits on scalps in this time

806
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,840
of day in other words don't leave

807
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,179
portions on

808
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,039
and again it's not optimal to expect a

809
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,220
second leg in price avoid greed here and

810
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,140
if you are fortunate to get 20 Pips be

811
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,799
content and exit

812
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,919
is just a weird animal and it's usually

813
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,520
very quiet so again my or our

814
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,799
understanding about if this uh true day

815
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,220
is that we're forming the initial high

816
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,440
and low of the day during this time so

817
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,899
again you're really having to be nimble

818
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,700
and I know what's going to happen you're

819
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,020
going to get in here and start monkeying

820
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,940
around with this trade and you're going

821
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,880
to see it shoot up and it's got 27 Pips

822
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,620
you didn't put a lemon odor in it but

823
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,080
automatically it shoots out 27 Pips and

824
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,640
you're in profit what do you think is

825
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,659
going to happen

826
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,100
you're gonna start thinking wow this is

827
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,020
the low of the day um I'm gonna I'm

828
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,340
gonna hold this thing and invariably

829
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,720
it won't be

830
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
it'll end up being a Judas swing later

831
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,399
on after midnight go lower and then it

832
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:12,600
stops you out and then what happens is

833
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,279
it freaks you out and you get mad and

834
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,720
you miss the actual mood that you should

835
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,340
have been looking for all along

836
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,559
did mean Judas swing dropping down to be

837
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,840
a buyer on that bullish day

838
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,399
so

839
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,440
I've given you some rules I've given you

840
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,659
some context about how I look at scalps

841
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,100
how the price engine models deliver

842
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,120
price

843
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,539
the offset accumulation and the

844
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,039
re-accumulation models that take place

845
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,080
for buying

846
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,700
Bank Traders will look for these

847
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,460
opportunities to pair up their orders

848
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,320
and that's how we can do the same thing

849
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,020
on scalping even if we think that the

850
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,120
Market's going to be quiet many times

851
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,120
you can get 15 20 Pips you know in a day

852
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,740
a couple times a week

853
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,080
that's it's all that's necessary to do

854
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,179
well remember we talked that 25 to 30

855
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,039
Pips a week doubles your money over a

856
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,600
year and we can actually start doing

857
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,580
that with scalping

858
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,440
until next lesson I wish you good luck

859
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,039
and good trade
