1
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,739
welcome back folks this is teaching

2
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,140
number seven of eight for the month of

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,260
November 2016 in the ICT mentorship

4
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,820
we're gonna be teaching trendline

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,420
Phantoms or false trend lines

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,460
and the first is going to be diagonal

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,160
trend line support

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,680
the priming is done by way of seeing the

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,020
market begin to make higher highs and

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,660
higher lows

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,460
the market appears to have an imaginary

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,859
diagonal line it seems to repel price

13
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,520
higher from

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,900
retail Traders will extend these

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,880
imaginary lines into the future and

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,299
attribute support theories to it

17
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,640
when price hits the extended imaginary

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
diagonal line connecting higher lows

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,540
retail traders buy it then

20
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,740
conversely diagonal trend line

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,200
resistance

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
this is primed in the thought processes

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
of retail Traders by seeing the market

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,079
begin to make hot

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,000
the market beginning to make lower highs

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,780
and lower lows

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,619
the market appears to have an imaginary

28
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,420
diagonal line it seems to propel price

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,140
lower from

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
retail Traders will extend these

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
imaginary lines into the future and

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,220
attribute resistance theories to them

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,659
when price hits the extended imaginary

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,579
diagonal line connecting lower highs

35
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,799
retail Traders short at that moment

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,080
okay trend line Theory now it's my

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,900
press it's

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,940
it's my perspective that there's no

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,400
basis on trend line theory in the form

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
of diagonal support or diagonal

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,020
resistance

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,580
and I believe it says basically an

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,840
opinion

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,480
um there's no statistical Edge that I've

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,900
been able to build with use of diagonal

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,340
support or resistance in the form of

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,840
trend lines

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,080
now I've been doing this for 24 years

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
coming up and just about the end of the

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
month we're actually producing this

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
video and I will have been a Trader for

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
24 years

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,040
and in 24 years I've done a lot of

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,500
things in analysis and I was

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
indoctrinated with trend lines when I

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,459
first started and to me it made perfect

57
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,019
sense because I could see it in the past

58
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,700
and you know all the books gave us

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,560
perfect examples where it all works but

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,420
when we try to use the trendline idea

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,040
you know which lows do you draw

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,379
connections to which highs do you draw

63
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,659
connections to and quickly all of a

64
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,000
sudden and you it's like well maybe this

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,220
isn't as easy as I thought it was

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,560
but does price have an awareness of the

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,300
point of trendline support

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,580
or does price have an awareness of the

69
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,739
point of trend line resistance I'll

70
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,959
submit to you that it does not

71
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,780
price has no awareness of your trend

72
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,940
line price doesn't respect what you have

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,120
on your charts price only respects where

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,159
the actual liquidity is in the

75
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,680
marketplace and because they can't see

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,659
you because you're too small

77
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,959
the marketplace sees where the large

78
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,120
pools of liquidity are that means in

79
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,739
buying interest and selling interest

80
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,420
that's already in the marketplace in the

81
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,400
form of protective cell stops protective

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,280
buy stops or new buy stocks for long

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,860
entries or new sell stops for selling

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,939
entries

85
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,920
that's the only thing that makes price

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,980
move and it's going to be hinged and

87
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,400
framed on the context of who

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
is in play right now what what smart

89
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,980
money entity has the control of the

90
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,780
marketplace at the moment is it going

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,720
higher based on their book being bullish

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,700
or is it going lower based on their book

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,620
being bearish and that's what this

94
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,238
mentorship teaches it gives you those

95
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,000
ideas to go into seeing where price is

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
most likely going to go and we don't

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,860
subscribe to down sloping trend lines or

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,600
up sloping trend lines to formulate

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,540
ideas in which we find support or

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,900
resistance based on that idea

101
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,000
do banks associate value or

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
prognostication on the basis of

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,479
trendline theory I'll submit to you no

104
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,940
they do not now for some that are in the

105
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,460
financial industry maybe you're working

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,800
at a bank maybe you have used them in

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,540
the past and you've had success I'm

108
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,340
telling you since the banks don't have

109
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,500
any association or prognostication

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,340
placed on valuing a trendline level on a

111
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,800
diagonal basis and the reason why is

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,220
because it's so subjective you are

113
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,840
associating future price movement to a

114
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,360
level that hasn't been traded to yet

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,220
you're doing it on the basis of

116
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,860
connecting two reference points in the

117
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,400
past that don't have any bearing on what

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
the future price is going to do has

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,340
nothing

120
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,800
that high that you connected to to a

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,419
lower high when you're looking for

122
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,600
resistance or down trending trend line

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,180
resistance that third time it supposedly

124
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,940
comes up to that line what makes you so

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,500
confident that it's going to go down at

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,340
that point

127
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,080
just because you drew the line on on

128
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,759
your chart

129
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,500
the the

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,380
Banks don't care what you're scribbling

131
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,940
all of your charts they don't care about

132
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,220
that they're not aware of it okay but

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,620
what they are aware of is sentiment that

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,080
shifts and builds around those levels

135
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
because it's going to be many times

136
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,319
being replicated on the fund level

137
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,139
funds will get beat up That's the basis

138
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,560
of trading large Traders are the prey

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,319
that's where the markets go they go for

140
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,240
their orders not for our little orders

141
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,360
not for our little liquidity okay but

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,220
because we've learned

143
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,280
to trade and herd

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,220
like the fund Traders

145
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,400
we all many times are casualties of that

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,160
war between smart money and large funds

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,259
that's the business model that goes on

148
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,840
large funds are cannibalized at

149
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,900
reversals but they're permitted to

150
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,660
facilitate long-term trends when the

151
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,819
markets are in that environment

152
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,440
but trend lines are not the key to it

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,479
is the very nature of trend lines flawed

154
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,160
at its core I will submit to you that

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,860
yes it is because it gives too many

156
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,479
dangling carrots in front of the

157
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,639
Trader's eyes thinking that okay this is

158
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,139
going to be an easy setup so therefore

159
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,280
let me go in here and sell out this

160
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,440
resistance trend line or let me buy it

161
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,620
this diagonal support trend line

162
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,960
it's not that easy folks but many times

163
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,440
our charts will paint these beautifully

164
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,759
disguised opportunities that are

165
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,759
impossibilities

166
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,440
knowing this

167
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,599
how can market makers capitalize on this

168
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,680
fallacy and price action

169
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,039
retail bullish trend line support

170
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,500
in periods when price is making higher

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,599
lows and higher highs the use of trend

172
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
line support will be adopted by retail

173
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
Traders

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,479
the influx of weak candid or less

175
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,080
informed money at an area or price level

176
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,660
provides liquidity for the market maker

177
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,819
the chart may appear bullish but the

178
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,800
underpinnings are in fact the opposite

179
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,900
the retail crowd will buy at a moment

180
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,419
when price will be devoid of support

181
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,759
price will collapse and leave the retail

182
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,860
Trader long withdraw down in the trade

183
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,840
when that third Touch of that uptrend

184
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,660
line is seen in price action many times

185
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,080
I get dialed in expecting the high that

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,120
forms between the low

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,740
at the second time it hits the trend

188
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,539
line and the third time it hits the

189
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,660
trend line that high in between I aim in

190
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,720
that high for a bare shorter block or I

191
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,940
will be allowing price to just briefly

192
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,860
poke its head above that high for a

193
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,199
turtle suit especially if the higher

194
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,940
time frame charts that I use for my

195
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,458
analysis indicate that we are not in a

196
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,080
bullish environment but the lower time

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,599
frames will many times paint these

198
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,599
beautifully Illustrated uptrend diagonal

199
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,320
support lines

200
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,240
so what I'm trying to do is I'm focusing

201
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,800
in on when the market maker sets their

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,320
traps for a sell scenario many times

203
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,899
that high in between the load it forms

204
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,180
if the second retouch of that trend line

205
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,880
and the third Touch of that trend line

206
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
the high in between there is going to be

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,620
a cell scenario that I'm aiming for in

208
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,240
that I'm looking for a bearish order

209
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
block or I'm looking for maybe sometimes

210
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,680
on a lower time frame I'm looking for a

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
breaker a bearish breaker where the

212
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,880
market has shown a willingness to Rally

213
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,459
up to take out an old high that's on a

214
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,380
lower time frame that may not be seen as

215
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,839
clear with that high in between point

216
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,940
number two and point number three

217
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,860
all I'm looking for is a reason to be

218
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,720
contrarian because if the trend line

219
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,660
looks so obvious to me I look at that as

220
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,080
a trap

221
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,600
retail Bears trend line resistance

222
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,420
in periods when price is making lower

223
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,180
lows and lower highs the use of trend

224
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,560
line resistance will be adopted by

225
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,779
retail Traders

226
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,459
the influx of weak candid are less

227
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,200
informed money at an area or price level

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,160
provides liquidity for the market maker

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,260
the chart may appear bearish but the

230
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,360
underpinnings are in fact the opposite

231
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
the retail crowd will sell at a moment

232
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,260
when the price will be devoid of

233
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,700
resistance

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,680
price will rally and leave the retail

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,760
Trader short withdraw down in the trade

236
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,579
between the high formed at Point number

237
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:13,620
two and point number three

238
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,440
the low in between those two points I'm

239
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,940
going to be aiming for a reason to be a

240
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,060
buyer down there because I I will submit

241
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,800
to you that if the higher time frames

242
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
are indicating that higher prices most

243
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
likely going to be in the near term and

244
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,380
we're trading a higher time frame

245
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,300
support levels based on order blocks or

246
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,160
institutional order flow

247
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,279
I'm looking for that low between High 2

248
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,800
and high 3. I'm looking for a bullish

249
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
order block at that low in between the

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,240
two points and while price may drop down

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
into that old low just by a little bit

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,440
but not getting down to the low

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,880
altogether

254
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,200
I will be looking for a bullish Order

255
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,940
Box to buy

256
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,300
or I will accept a break just below that

257
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,060
low for a turtle soup long entry or

258
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,880
basically a run on the cell stops many

259
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,800
times the market will break through

260
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,300
now a point of which I wanna draw a

261
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,240
attention to is the second point at

262
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,820
which you have that trend line

263
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,740
in other words that the first High you

264
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,839
you see and it comes down and makes a

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,640
lower high number two and it trades

266
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,200
lower and you think it's going back up

267
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,959
to make a a number three point High

268
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,060
that's lower or three times touching on

269
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,339
that downtrend when the market rallies

270
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm actually going to be looking for a

271
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,120
move up into that second High because

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,459
that's where a lot of the buy stocks are

273
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,079
going to be residing

274
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,120
the same thing said just an opposite

275
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,740
when we're looking for that sell

276
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,040
scenario in bullish trend line support

277
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,660
retail's gonna be looking forward to go

278
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,160
higher I'm looking forward to go down

279
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
below Point number two that's where

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,519
everyone's stop loss is going to be

281
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,560
now when you think about like this trend

282
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
lines in the form of diagonal basis

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,820
support and resistance it's really a

284
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,139
toss-up

285
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,880
do you have confidence that the trend

286
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,380
line that you're drawing is going to

287
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,079
really Provide support or resistance

288
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,240
think about it it's really Associated

289
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,940
closely to flipping a coin

290
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,100
heads are going to be a buyer and guess

291
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,560
what tells you'd be a seller

292
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,839
you're back to the same equation of

293
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,079
chance and we do not trade with the

294
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,339
perspective of chance

295
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,440
when we trade we look at the marketplace

296
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,420
to provide clues

297
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,000
clues in which the smart money is going

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,620
to be utilizing

299
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,899
the liquidity that's made available for

300
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,000
willing or unwilling liquidity in the

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,720
form of the funds and uninformed money

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,399
you have to think like that liquidity

303
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,600
for product

304
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
prices delivered to engineer efficiency

305
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,440
for the smart money entities only

306
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,160
okay folks let's take a look at examples

307
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,459
here

308
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,079
okay I want to take a look at this

309
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,760
high right here

310
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,459
okay price has a nice run away from that

311
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,000
so that very nice animated term High

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,240
put an Impulse price swing moving lower

313
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
and we have

314
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
a gap in here fair value Gap from the

315
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
low of this candle to the high of this

316
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,060
candle there's only been down movement

317
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,480
with this candle's body

318
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,220
I'm going to highlight this whole area

319
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,899
in here

320
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,060
and we're going to reference the

321
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,320
the low of that candle

322
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,720
right here

323
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,980
Okay so

324
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,079
we're going to watch price as it trades

325
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,579
that's just a reactionary level that

326
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,779
we're gonna be waiting for in the future

327
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,600
so this is how we stalk the setup price

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
starts to Rally up

329
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
trades right into that 52 34 level right

330
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
there

331
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,060
that day it occurs

332
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:00,480
is December 11 2015.

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,459
okay over here on the right hand side

334
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,639
we have the 15 minute time frame

335
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,000
for December 11 2015.

336
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,160
and we're going to delineate that

337
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,880
same high

338
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,600
at 52.34

339
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,720
and you see price hitting it right here

340
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,959
and I want you to look at how this low

341
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,880
connected to this low here

342
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,980
projected out eventually has another

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,139
third time hitting it

344
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,079
okay so trend line followers and see

345
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,899
that as a potential continuation to go

346
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,420
higher finding some support here one two

347
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,839
three maybe a run up higher

348
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,360
problem is is we have

349
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,920
a daily

350
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,540
institutional reference pulling over

351
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,320
here

352
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,079
and we're in that area over here in this

353
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,300
whole shaded area we've closed that in

354
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
so we would be looking for the next area

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,980
of liquidity

356
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,019
and down here so we can look at this

357
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,380
range

358
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,000
from this Down Candles High

359
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,980
from this damn candle's High

360
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,300
up

361
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,639
to this Down Candles low

362
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,220
between this candle's high and this

363
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,100
candle is low it's only been one pass on

364
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,240
the upside so we're going to be looking

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,519
for price I want to come back down into

366
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,899
this candle is high in the form of

367
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,560
50 60. okay so 150 60 level

368
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,579
so we know there's a possibility to see

369
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,259
price want to drop lower based on

370
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,579
liquidity

371
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,720
we have trend lines in here that would

372
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,639
be reasonable in terms of what retail

373
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,459
would be drawing

374
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,560
expecting some bullish prices

375
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,540
let me show you what it may look like at

376
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,759
the time when it was forming

377
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,279
okay you have a Hello here they're

378
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,380
finding some support here old high back

379
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,480
here so they could reasonably expect to

380
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,699
see this to trade higher

381
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,860
problem is the only thing it's done

382
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,220
is moved back up into the last up candle

383
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,320
here which is a bearish order block

384
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,100
right there

385
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,339
so using the market efficiency paradigm

386
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,779
we don't see this as trendline support

387
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,440
we see this as a return up into a reason

388
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,320
to get short more and the market breaks

389
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
lower

390
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,959
Market trades down into a low right here

391
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,459
which we'll look at let me zoom out a

392
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,779
couple minutes

393
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,639
but we have a low here we have another

394
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,220
low here protecting that low out in time

395
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,100
okay we can see price coming down to

396
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,279
that third time does it make a bullet

397
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,440
scenario no it's only going up to the

398
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,799
last up candles Midway point or mean

399
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
threshold

400
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,240
so let's take a look at what that is

401
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,599
okay right in here equilibrium trading

402
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,299
rate that uh reference point we're gonna

403
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,439
be looking for price to come down and

404
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,720
close in this void this candle is low

405
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,119
here and this candle is high so in here

406
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,240
has a liquidity void

407
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,620
and we have

408
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,080
cell stops below this low here again

409
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,660
remembering that we're focusing on the

410
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,640
idea on the daily chart like a bank

411
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,120
would looking for 150 60 level

412
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,860
so up here we're looking at this Market

413
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,020
move higher

414
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,960
anything that was viewed as support on

415
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,720
diagonal basis on a trend line we're

416
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,760
going to look at that as suspect and

417
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,960
buyers are going to come in here in a

418
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,820
big influx

419
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,020
we're going to have wonderful

420
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,700
opportunities to be sellers to them

421
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,950
Market trades up into

422
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,000
[Music]

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
equilibrium one more time Pierce is the

424
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,419
high turtle soup

425
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,100
s off and it trades around one more time

426
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,559
down into this level in here so I'm

427
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,240
going to zoom out a little bit to a 30

428
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,100
minute chart you can see that

429
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,160
other trend line so we have a low here

430
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,620
extend out in time here's another low

431
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,740
and price comes down hits it here is

432
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,780
that a buy no it's only coming back up

433
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,840
into this last up candle bear shoulder

434
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,900
block cell here do not see this as a

435
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,419
bullish scenario because of trend lines

436
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,700
because we're expecting this area here

437
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,740
to promote selling

438
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,900
okay it's in an area which we're going

439
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
to be looking for a sell-off

440
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,539
price does in fact sell off

441
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,000
and you see the bearishness here it runs

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,860
back above old High

443
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,720
turtle soup

444
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,820
or Bear's order block

445
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,980
okay because we're using a higher time

446
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,679
frame setup over here you stop would

447
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,900
provide you an opportunity to put a stop

448
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,620
above and hold high back here

449
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,539
price accelerates goes through what

450
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,260
would be considered trend line support

451
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,039
and ultimately

452
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,760
down into the 150 60 level

453
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,340
right here

454
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,600
and as you can see it over here

455
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,080
so let's take a look at some

456
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,299
downtrending or bearish trend lines that

457
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,740
are actually buy scenarios

458
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,120
okay folks we have a nice run up here

459
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,380
two Down Candles right for the up move

460
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,100
okay so we have 143.85 where thereabouts

461
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,340
the opening price on the ears 143.84 so

462
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,080
we'll round it to 43.85

463
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,740
okay we have a down candle hits 43.85

464
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,400
so we're going to add 43.85 to our

465
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,659
lower time frame chart

466
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,600
so 43.85

467
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,500
we see price

468
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,900
trading down into it here hitting it one

469
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,159
more time

470
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,620
we have a high we have a lower high and

471
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,260
the third time price hits it here

472
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,960
we see this as a cell no we don't we see

473
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,140
it as a potential Turtle Soup long here

474
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,539
or a return back to bullish order block

475
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,740
so we could be a buyer at 43 85 or 43.90

476
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,980
on a limit or if we can get a fill at

477
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,520
43.80 or lower it's going to be a buyer

478
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,840
down here with the expectation that this

479
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,720
is a false trend line and

480
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,480
we would be looking for this High here

481
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,580
that's the second one so anyone would be

482
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,980
short all their protected buy stocks

483
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,860
will be above this high in here

484
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,059
price rallies away

485
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,520
comes out real close to this high end

486
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
here

487
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
one more retracement lower

488
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,539
back down into the last two Down Candles

489
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,100
here as a buying opportunity

490
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,260
again up here is where we'd be expecting

491
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,460
to see

492
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,080
the buy starts to be tagged

493
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,320
you can see that happening here

494
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,179
five stops is right there

495
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,280
you can see that happening here buy

496
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,100
stops hit right here

497
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,720
then

498
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,460
you'd be permitted to see lower prices

499
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,860
because we've seen the highs taken out

500
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,820
here

501
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,700
for the form of a buy stop read and then

502
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,320
now the liquidity below here would be

503
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,100
allowed to be tested

504
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,200
can you see that happening here

505
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,419
's another example we have a nice down

506
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,460
candle here bullish order Block it's

507
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,679
validated when the Scandal trades above

508
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,260
this down candle is high the very next

509
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,480
camera we trade up again in the third

510
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
candle you see it opens here and trades

511
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,220
down into the body of this down candle

512
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,440
the main threshold is approximately 144

513
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
big figure and the open comes in at

514
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,059
144.46 on this down candle so we have 46

515
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,940
pit range in here and the the day on

516
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,039
this candle is the 18th of May

517
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,260
of 2016.

518
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,559
we see the

519
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,659
18th of May here

520
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,659
okay and we see the high a lower high

521
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,000
can extend that out in time does the

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,039
price sell off here the little bit but

523
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
then it comes up Pops through one more

524
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,059
time so traders that even see this as a

525
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,280
downtrend that maybe have been broken

526
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,500
they may see this as a return back down

527
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,539
into it to be a buyer and they're wrong

528
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:10,620
there as well

529
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,039
also you may see a classic chart pattern

530
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,500
here that we haven't spoke about but

531
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,460
we're going to talk about it in this

532
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,900
mentorship as well

533
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,900
classic chart pattern triangle

534
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,419
and false breakout here they would have

535
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,580
been wrong even trading with that and

536
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,799
exploding up into one of the 146 big

537
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,419
figure now the reason why 146 big

538
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,039
figures is the last up candle in the

539
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:32,940
daily chart

540
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
and it closed in all these Down Candles

541
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,500
so intutional order flow you're going to

542
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
see price come up and close all that in

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,340
so it's only been delivered on the

544
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,860
downside all Down Candles price has to

545
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,919
be efficiently balanced by offering on

546
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,900
the buy side after it's been sold off

547
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,299
and been offered on the sell side price

548
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,799
to be efficiently delivered has to be

549
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,419
offered on the buy side so we see that

550
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,179
rally back up into that 146 big figure

551
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,860
and that's why it quickly ran up into

552
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,440
that level here but breaking

553
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
this idea of

554
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,760
these supposed

555
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,620
trend lines

556
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,779
that's not the key to it guys but we can

557
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,000
see when the trades are seeing these

558
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
retail fingerprints all over it

559
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,179
probabilities really shift in our favor

560
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,860
when we're doing the opposite of it and

561
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,000
we can also justify it with

562
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,320
institutional order flow and

563
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,820
institutional reference points on a

564
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,679
daily chart just like a bank would

565
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,419
so hopefully you enjoyed this teaching

566
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,159
go back through all your charts look at

567
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,720
some of the moves that's taken place and

568
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,100
go down to the lower time frames and

569
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,659
actually see how these trend lines are

570
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,120
really there as Phantoms and Retail

571
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,500
chases them and when they think they see

572
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
them

573
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,080
they're really not there and they end up

574
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,299
giving up The Ghost and their profits
