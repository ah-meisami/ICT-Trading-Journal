1
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,360
for the month of november 2016

2
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
ict mentorship

3
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
we're talking about false tops and

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
bottom patterns as it relates to

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,079
classical head and shoulders

6
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,079
now head and shoulders pattern is

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
typically seen with a

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,600
price high

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
that trades in a small little

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
retracement then it creates a higher

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,079
high

12
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
and it retraces back

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,800
lower and it creates another lower

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
price peak or short-term high and then

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
connecting those three successive peaks

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
in price

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
we classically refer to that as the

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
neckline and classical support

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
resistance ideas are seen here where if

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
that neckline is broken

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,759
many times you'll see it retrace or pull

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,360
back up to that neckline and then sell

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,040
off again

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
in the form of

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
selecting targets you can measure the

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,080
range from the neckline up to the head

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
or the highest peak

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920
and subtract that range from the

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,400
neckline once price breaks below it

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,759
and i'll give you a reasonable price

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
objective now the problem with this

32
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,720
pattern okay it's

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
because it's taught in all of our retail

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
books and such every trader out there

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,079
when they first get in their charts

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,600
they're always looking for these types

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
of patterns

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,119
but generally price will form these

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
genuinely at intermediate or long-term

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,320
highs only

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
and due to the low understanding of most

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
retail traders they tend to seek these

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,119
classic topping patterns on lower time

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
frames

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,160
and many times at a significant low in

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,920
price but they marry the pattern

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
the opposite is referred to as an

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
inverted head and shoulders pattern this

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
is a false pattern false bottom pattern

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
we're going to be teaching in here so

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
we're not really teaching these

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
classical patterns

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
uh they can be found on the internet i'm

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
not going to teach that but what i'm

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
actually going to tell you is how you

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
can capitalize on these patterns when

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
they appear in charts

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
and our higher time frame premise

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
indicates the opposite direction is

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,760
unfolding

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,959
but an inverted head and shoulders

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,000
pattern is

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,720
typically seen with a short-term low

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
that's met with a lower low

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
then it makes a higher short-term low

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,160
and you connect the highs that form

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
around those three successive lower lows

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
and we refer to that as the neckline

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
eventually should price trade above that

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,519
neckline classically you would expect a

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,040
pullback in price

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
or retrace it back down to the neckline

73
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,519
and then advance me up to the target and

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
the range from the neckline down to the

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
lowest low of those three lows

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,959
added to the neckline once the price

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,159
breaks through it that would give you a

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,560
reasonable upside objective now again

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,319
much in the same way generally price

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,080
will form these

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
genuinely at intermediate or long-term

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
lows

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
and again much like we said with the

84
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,000
regular classical head and shoulders

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
pattern due to the low understanding of

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
most retail traders they go into the

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
lower time frames and they start looking

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
for this classic modern pattern on lower

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,120
time frame charts

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
and many times at a significant high in

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
price

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
but much like you probably done when you

93
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
first started the trader you get these

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
textbooks and you get these ideas and

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
you go in you force

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,480
the

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,879
understanding of what you learned

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
out of the books into the charts so

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
therefore you learned about head and

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
shoulders patterns so therefore there

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,959
must be a head and shoulders pattern

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
right now so let's go in there and trade

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
it

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
and unfortunately it doesn't always

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
equate to profitability

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,920
uh i when i first started as a futures

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
trader this was one of the patterns that

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
were

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
really promoted hard because it's the

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,639
idea that you want to cut so high and

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,798
you want to catch a bottom and

112
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
picking tops and bottoms is one of the

113
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
worst games to play especially the new

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
trader because number one even seasoned

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,800
pros don't do that okay we don't we

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,639
don't pick tops and bottoms

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,880
we can trade with rather

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,360
impressive new accuracy in in catching

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
significant intermediate term lows and

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
short-term lows and highs but as it

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
relates to long-term tops and bottoms

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,240
i try to avoid that and i actually

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
promote the idea of doing the same thing

124
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
in your own trading try not to do that

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
but one of the coolest things i've

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
learned by going through institutional

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
order flow studies and watching how

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
interbank pricing is delivered

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
it allows me to go in and actually see

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
these patterns when they form in price

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,919
charts

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
if i have a

133
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
indication that the price is actually

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
going to go higher and i see a

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
head and shoulders pattern which would

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
be a false top

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
in my opinion but in the charts retail

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
will see that as a top forming

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
conversely looking at it inverted head

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
and shoulders which would be classically

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
viewed as a bullish pattern in price

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
if i see that happening when the market

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,639
is

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,000
actually bearish

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
i would be looking to go short

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,199
and

147
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,000
where

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
we see the

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
neckline let's go back to the standard

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
head and shoulders pattern

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,000
when you look at the neckline

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
what i see there is an opportunity to be

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
long once the neckline is broken on the

154
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
downside especially if we are in a

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
institutionally trained bullish

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
environment that means if we're in a

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
long term or immediate term low

158
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
and it forms a

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
successive three peaks

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,320
in price moving higher which would be

161
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
classically viewed as a head shoulders

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
pattern um chartist pure chartist would

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,880
see that as a

164
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
bearish indication especially new newbie

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
traders or less informed traders i like

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
seeing when price does that because to

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
me it's a retail trap

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
and marketing is actually uh designing

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
classical chart patterns in price where

170
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,840
you can actually

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
get tripped up thinking just because you

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,759
saw a head shortage formation and the

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,319
neckline's broken um when that neckline

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
is broken

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
i don't see that pullback as a

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,800
resuming lower or a new selling scenario

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
i see that as a turtle soup long that

178
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
took out two previous lows where the

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
clean lows were there i look at that as

180
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
a buying opportunity so i'll buy the

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
cell stops below those equal lows or

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
where the neckline is and then i'll look

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,400
for the head

184
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
or the highest peak to be violated and

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,759
i'll try to pair up my

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
long exits with the buy stops above the

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
highest high

188
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,960
in this pattern

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
and that would be my first objective

190
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
the inverted head shoulders i would do

191
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,599
the opposite if i'm looking for

192
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
price action to be bearish

193
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
as a higher time frame would indicate

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
and i see a low with a lower low and a

195
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
higher low which would be deemed as a

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
inverted head and shoulders i don't see

197
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
that as a bullish breakout above the

198
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
neckline i'm actually looking at that as

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
a run on buy stops

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
and i'm going to look to go short there

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
and not expect to see price go higher

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
but in fact blow out those equal highs

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and then make a run for the cell stops

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,080
below what would be deemed as the head

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
on this pattern or would be the lowest

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
low and most recent price action

207
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,360
you can actually take your first profit

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
at the right shoulder on both these

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,000
patterns

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
respectively but let's take a look at a

211
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,840
couple chart examples and you can see

212
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
what this pattern looks like in price

213
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,319
okay folks we're looking at a daily

214
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
chart of british pound usd or cable

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
and i want you to take a look at this

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
down candle

217
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
right before the up move we've

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
consolidated for a while price came down

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,599
and hit that same order block right here

220
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,440
okay closed in

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,319
the

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,960
fair value gap between the high

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,879
to the midway point of the candle and

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,160
look at this candle right next to it

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
price came down and respected

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
that range

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,080
okay

228
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
right in here didn't go any farther than

229
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
that

230
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
and then on this day here

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
it's august 10th

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,719
we traded through the down candle

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
making this a bullish order block right

234
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,679
in here

235
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,760
so from this candle's high down to its

236
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,080
opening it becomes sensitive

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,880
to be a buyer

238
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
right there

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
and the high comes in at 1 55 46

240
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
so on this day here we trade down into

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
it on the 12th

242
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
of august 2015.

243
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
shaded right down into the body of that

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
down candle which is a bullish water

245
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,399
block

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
now that's bullish on a daily so let's

247
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
take a look at a hourly chart at that

248
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,480
same time on

249
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
august 12th

250
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,279
so here we have the market making a high

251
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
a higher high

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
and a lower high and we have two equal

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
lows in here so we have what

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
we have a head and shoulders pattern

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
retail traders are going to see that as

256
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,760
a selling scenario

257
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
so they're going to look for a break of

258
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
this neckline

259
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,839
and then take the range from the high

260
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
down to that neckline and subtract that

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
that will give them their objective for

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,680
going short

263
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,920
okay so we have that range here

264
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
and we can duplicate that and give

265
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
ourselves our downside objective for the

266
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
retail mining crowd

267
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
so retail is going to think this

268
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
breakdown here is going to lead them

269
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,800
down to 155 or thereabouts in this range

270
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
here so retail is going to expect

271
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
a range expansion

272
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,079
down to a low of

273
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,040
154.95

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
we do not expect that because on the

275
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
daily chart we're expecting the bullsh

276
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
order block to send prices higher so

277
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
while we see a in a regular head and

278
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,079
shoulders pattern which would be

279
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,680
classical bearishness

280
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
in the part of price action study

281
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,399
as it relates to institutional order

282
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,079
flow we're looking at the run below

283
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,320
these lows in here as they run on

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
sale stops

285
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,760
so we're looking at the market to go

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200
below here to pair up orders to go long

287
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
for those individuals that want to have

288
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
a sell stop down here that's already

289
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
long their trailing stops loss is going

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
to be in the form of a sales stop

291
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,600
because the market moved most recently

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
has been higher

293
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
we see this move below these equal lows

294
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,399
as an opportunity to buy those sell

295
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
stops those willing sell stops or flood

296
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
the market when the market trades below

297
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,480
here so now we have a lot of liquidity

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
remember that market efficiency paradigm

299
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
we see liquidity here in the form of

300
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
going long and we're going to be looking

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
for

302
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,399
objective up here

303
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,839
to take profits

304
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
so we could be a buyer

305
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,000
at 155.50

306
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
and look for 5620

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
a move above this high

308
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
5620

309
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
as our objective or 70 pips

310
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,680
the market runs one two three four more

311
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
times below that low gathering up the

312
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
cell stops and then expansion

313
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,680
which pairs up the buy stops above 5620

314
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
and ultimately you can see a nice little

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
little pool back here

316
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,839
okay so that's an objective

317
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,040
of using

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
the head and shoulders pattern

319
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
against

320
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
what retail would expect

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
and using higher time frame

322
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
institutional order flow on the daily

323
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
chart reading it as the banks would

324
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
let's go back out to that daily chart

325
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
you can see what it did as a result

326
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
and there's that expansion and it's not

327
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
much of a move but that you don't need

328
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,200
much of it we understand what you're

329
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
looking for okay we have another example

330
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
here this is the daily of the british

331
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,120
pound usds

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
the

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
down candle right before this big move

334
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,639
up

335
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
equal highs in here there would have

336
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
been buy stops above these highs

337
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
this rally up takes out those buy stops

338
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,560
and it comes all the way up and closes

339
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,839
in its range

340
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,279
all up here so this liquidity voids

341
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,399
closed in that's up candle

342
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,360
closes it in but more importantly these

343
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
stops were targeted

344
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
with this down candle that means that

345
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
this down candle was a bullish order

346
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,839
block which is used to break

347
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
the buy stops that were in the

348
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
marketplace here

349
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
so when price trades below it here when

350
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
price comes back up to it here we're

351
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
inside of a breaker that's a bearish

352
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
environment 153 45 to 153.50

353
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,880
in that area we're looking for a reason

354
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,279
to expect some kind of a

355
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,519
bearishness

356
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,480
but

357
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
there's going to be

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
on a lower time frame

359
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,680
retail will see patterns like this we

360
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
have a low

361
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
a lower low

362
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
higher low

363
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
this is an inverted head and shoulders

364
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,519
pattern

365
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,800
you draw your

366
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
neckline on

367
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
the chart

368
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,440
okay

369
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
that's the high up here

370
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,839
and we're going to draw what would be

371
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,440
considered the

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
inverted head and shoulders neckline

373
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,320
connecting

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
these two levels here and the difference

375
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
would be from the low up to this

376
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
neckline once we break above it

377
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,320
price trades above it here

378
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,600
neckline is broken

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
the stops below here would be would be

380
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,959
targeted

381
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,800
so selling up here on a break above the

382
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
neckline

383
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
not looking at that as bullishness and

384
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,519
return for

385
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
higher prices but looking for it to sell

386
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,279
off getting above there so we would look

387
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,800
for that run

388
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,360
to sell into the buy stops above this

389
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,600
high here and above this high here

390
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
that's why i would expect to see some

391
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
bears this year and then we would wait

392
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
for a run below these lows here it does

393
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
give a lot more than that here but

394
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
nonetheless it's not a bad little trade

395
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,560
uh 10 20 30 40 50 60 70

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
80 pips or more running them low over

397
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
here

398
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,440
let's go back out to the daily

399
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
okay we're going to look up at this high

400
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
up here

401
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,519
price trades up into it here

402
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
we're going to use the low of the last

403
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,040
up candle

404
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,639
right here and the body of the candle

405
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,079
you can see that it trades up into that

406
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,199
as well

407
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,040
and we're going to look up at the

408
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,839
18th

409
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,959
on

410
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,160
october

411
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,839
okay so we have here's the

412
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,639
15th

413
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,560
creating a

414
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
head and shoulders inverted so that

415
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
would be viewed as bullishness

416
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
so if we get above

417
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
that high we can be a seller

418
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
because we would expect those buy stops

419
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,720
to be viewed as breakout artists on in

420
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
inverted head and shoulders they're

421
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,199
going to see that as bullish pattern

422
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
we're going to look at it as a bearish

423
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,519
pattern we're going to be completely

424
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,800
opposite of that

425
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
now you can do two things you can use

426
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,519
this here or you can use the bodies of

427
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
the candles like i teach

428
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
where the most volume is so this is the

429
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
highest body of the candle so 5502 would

430
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,800
be a cell

431
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,600
if we get above it

432
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,600
price trades to it here so you can be a

433
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,399
seller above 5502

434
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
so 5502 is your

435
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,880
area being

436
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
bearish we do not look at that as a

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
breakout and then wait for a pullback

438
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
for new higher prices we're looking to

439
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
see it sell off and there's your entry

440
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,959
on

441
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
the buy stops at 55.02

442
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,000
and the neckline

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
i'm sorry the head down here

444
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,160
your objective would be to cover

445
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
below that low right here

446
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
and that happens

447
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,959
right there

448
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
and then again all through here gives

449
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
you another opportunity to cover

450
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
and ultimately uh runs one more time

451
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
above that 5502 level

452
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
for buy stops and then again below what

453
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
would be the head

454
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,399
plenty opportunity to get me handsome

455
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,920
profits

456
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,680
so again it's you look for the pattern

457
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,480
because retail will look for the pattern

458
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
but you're going to fade that pattern

459
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
based on what you see

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
on the higher time frames we look for

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,160
institutional overflow to justify why

462
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
this should be bearish up in here we

463
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,959
should be looking for reasons to be

464
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,839
selling

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
not buying and if we see inverted head

466
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
and shoulders patterns on the lower time

467
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
frames retail's gonna be all over that

468
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
looking for bullish you know upside

469
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,079
moves

470
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
and that's not what you see here at all

471
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,280
hopefully you found this one insightful

472
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
as well we're going to be attacking a

473
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,039
lot of the retail-minded classical chart

474
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
patterns throughout this ict mentorship

475
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
so uh this is just the beginning of two

476
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
that will fall victim to

477
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,840
institutional order flow until next time

478
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,200
wish you good luck and good trading
