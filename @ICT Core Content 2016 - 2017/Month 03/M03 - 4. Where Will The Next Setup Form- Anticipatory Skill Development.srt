1
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,960
okay folks welcome back this is the

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
fourth teaching of eight of the november

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
2016 content

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
for the ict mentorship

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
okay we're going to talk about

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
some anticipatory skill sets and one of

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
the skill sets that i teach

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,719
is using the monthly chart

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,000
but this teaching is going to be

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
specifically dealing with

11
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
using institutional order flow

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,840
to help you find new setups

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,559
when we look at the monthly chart

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
the first thing you remember is remind

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159
yourself that the monthly charts are

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,439
only going to move

17
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
with a great deal of money behind

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
these price swings and retails i'm not

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,159
going to have it

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,880
the idea of seeing

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
big ranges on a monthly chart

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
that's going to be a

23
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,920
result of enormous amounts of buying or

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,479
selling interest by the smart money

25
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
again retail can't move

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
price so

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
if we can see where they're most likely

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
going to

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,240
place orders to buy or sell and we can

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
see on the monthly chart we stand to

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
make a great deal

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
of pips and we don't have to trade a

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
whole lot to do it

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
but i want you to think about the opens

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,640
the highs the close and the low

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
of every single candle

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,399
on

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
a monthly chart over the last

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
three months

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
every pair that you uh

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
that you have on your platform this is a

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,320
good study not to trade every single

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,479
pair but i want you to go back over

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
every pair you think is

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
of interest to you

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
and have the open high loan closed

47
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,040
delineated on a monthly chart over the

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
last three months so that would look

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
like this we're in november now

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,640
so here's october

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
september

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
august

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
and having those reference points

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,480
on your chart

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
and having those levels uh transposed

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
into your lower time frames they'll

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
bring a great deal clarity

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
now you may have a few overlapping

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
levels like this

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
chart we have a couple different opens

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
and closes that are real close to

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
proximity

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,879
that's okay

64
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
but i want you to find the most recent

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
down candle

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,800
that would be this one here

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
there you go

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,159
and then prior to this

69
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,680
down candle

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
what up candle exists above it

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
so much if this is the down candle you

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
got to go above its high

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
so its high is

74
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
if i can get it to show up

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,920
okay the high is 31.44 so we have to

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
have an up candle or an up close candle

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,159
that has at least

78
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,120
a low that's higher than

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
3144.

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
obviously it's right here

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
just that quick

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
we've delineated

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
a range on the monthly chart

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,360
now by itself you've done a great deal

85
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
already

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
but i know you don't believe it you have

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
to see it you need to have faith in it

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
so what we defined is the range in which

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
we're going to trade in

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
if i take these two reference points and

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,879
i'll drop them down into a weekly chart

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
okay by having it on a weekly chart we

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,959
can have a lot more information refined

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,799
and let's delineate

95
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
this month here

96
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
with the vertical line

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,238
on the month prior to it so now we have

98
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,000
a down candle

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
to the right

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,919
of this vertical red line

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
so we're looking at june this is june

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
having a down close

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
so we go into a daily chart i'm sorry

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
weekly chart okay

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
we have price still in the long term

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
consolidation many weeks going by here

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,160
and these two down candles here

108
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
price trades through it on this candle

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
here

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
so now we have activated two two down

111
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
candles as a bullish order block we have

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
upside movement here

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
it violates the two down candles so now

114
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,039
we can see

115
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,440
price return back down into it it would

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
be a bullish scenario

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,639
notice also that the monthly

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,600
candle at 130 70 we'll call it 130 80.

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
well let's round it to 130 80.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,280
that's close enough for government work

121
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
price drops down into that a couple

122
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
different times

123
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
and you see price is expanded now the

124
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
upside is still

125
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
that monthly bearish order block

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,080
it's also

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,960
the beginning of the last three candles

128
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
that were up it's the same as this up

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
candle slow

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
you can see price and you can probably

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
already visualize it reaching for this

132
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
probably going into next uh week or the

133
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,240
week after

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
we'll probably see see more

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
continuation on the upside

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,080
we go into a daily chart

137
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
okay you can see the vertical lines

138
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,639
delineate each month

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
see

140
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,479
price dipping down into

141
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,319
that monthly

142
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,639
open that we rounded up to 130 80.

143
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
price responds aggressively off of that

144
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
and then we have

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
the beginning of this decline here in

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
october

147
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
and this is the reason why

148
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
and it sounds

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
like

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
hindsight

151
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
if you're watching this without having

152
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
the benefit of being a part of the live

153
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,240
sessions and watching the recordings

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,479
over the last last week

155
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,520
but we looked at 132.80 as a downside

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
objective

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
and the reason why that was objective

158
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,759
was based on these two down candles here

159
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
and the fact that we are looking for

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
higher prices relative to what's been

161
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
shown on

162
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,199
the monthly

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,039
okay

164
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
so we see price retrading back into this

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
down candle

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
multiple times right here on this one

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
and then ultimately

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
retreating down into the higher level

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,000
3280 level

170
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,080
right in here

171
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
and you can see price expanding on the

172
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
upside so we're looking for 138

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
big figure and potentially higher than

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
that

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
the takeaway is this if you look at your

176
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
monthly charts

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
okay

178
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
and you define where you're at presently

179
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
in the range

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
all you have to do is find the most

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
recent down candle and most recent up

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
candle and there's your range

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
if you get the market trade above a down

184
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
candle you wait for a return back to

185
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
that down candle to trade up into the

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
last up candle

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
if you have a market trade up into

188
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
a

189
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,440
up candle you find the last down candle

190
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,719
the most recent down candle which will

191
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,599
be over here that would be a range

192
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,519
for the downside

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
so we have still have

194
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
upside still to go

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,839
for

196
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
dollar cad on a monthly basis

197
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,760
let's look at this same example

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
of study on a

199
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,519
u.s japanese yen pair

200
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
okay we have the most recent

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
down candle here

202
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
and prior to this down candle you have

203
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
to have a candle that's higher than the

204
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
candle's high

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
which is

206
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,279
104 35

207
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,560
so above here

208
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
to the left where's the up candle it's

209
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
here

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
there's your range so between 106 28

211
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
and 103

212
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
26 so basically 300 pips

213
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
the idea as soon as this candle trades

214
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,399
above

215
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
the down candle's high

216
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
this down candle becomes a bullish order

217
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,720
block

218
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,279
so we can be a buyer at 103.26 or less

219
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,560
we drop into a weekly chart

220
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
here's price trading below 103

221
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,600
26 and again here on the us election

222
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
trading down into the bullish order

223
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,839
block

224
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,519
here we go into a daily chart

225
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
you can see the body of this down candle

226
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,279
it's larger than this one here

227
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,640
so this is the beginning of the bullish

228
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
order block

229
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,120
tear

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
and mean threshold of this down candle

231
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
would be about right here

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
and it's not even challenged at all here

233
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,079
even on the election

234
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
uh knee-jerk reaction

235
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
so price dips down into it here this

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
will be a buy

237
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,560
it starts to rally away then the next

238
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
candle opens on the election

239
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
trades down into

240
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
previous bullish order block this would

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
be another buy

242
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,160
and rallying away

243
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
we have old highs back here

244
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
and we have equal highs back here

245
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
on the

246
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
monthly chart this is the objective we

247
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
would be reaching up to and we've

248
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
already seen that happen with 300 pips

249
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
plus

250
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,420
choose kiwi dollar

251
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,959
[Music]

252
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,760
and go to a monthly

253
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
okay so we have

254
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
the last

255
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
down candle

256
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
here

257
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
and the most recent up candle

258
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
here

259
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,760
okay

260
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
and we've moved away from the last stop

261
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
candle

262
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
exercising this as a

263
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
bearish order block

264
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
we go down to a weekly

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
okay you see price trading up into bear

266
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
shoulder block it does trade through the

267
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,720
body of this candle but it's rather

268
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
sloppy right now

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
the downside objective is 69.83

270
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
so 6985

271
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
the bodies of these candles here

272
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
closed comes in at

273
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
70.05 so that would probably be where i

274
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,120
would be looking to cover

275
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
it's about 120 pips or so

276
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
still potential downside objective

277
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
personally on the side now i think it's

278
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
going to go down here

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,639
to 67.80

280
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,079
and on the daily time frame

281
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
you can see price has in fact already

282
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,160
moved

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,560
a good distance

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
now this is the bearish order block up

285
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
in here

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
so anything above that

287
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,120
price had reached up into we can refine

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
that into a lower level time frame

289
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
bearish overblock

290
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,000
see it trading it here

291
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
minimum expectation is to trade down to

292
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
here

293
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
the next one would be down here

294
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
so you're going to reach for that

295
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,560
and then below these lows

296
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,560
so we're using the monthly chart to give

297
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,519
us our bullish and bearish order blocks

298
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,760
and define our range and then we look

299
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
for lower time frames to get closer

300
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
to the market and refine our risk

301
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
use the higher time frame monthly chart

302
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,720
find the most recent up candle and most

303
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
recent down candle there's your range

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
define that range in terms of where the

305
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,680
most recent order flow has sent

306
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,519
price was it violating a down close or

307
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,880
down candle which

308
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
gives that

309
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,560
permission to become a bullish order

310
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,519
block

311
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
or has price broken

312
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
an up candle

313
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,399
by violating its low

314
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,399
which then activates that as a bearish

315
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,959
order block um you just simply look for

316
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,279
the the contrary and order block

317
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
on the monthly chart

318
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
and you take those levels and you find

319
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
them down until weekly into a daily and

320
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
down to an hourly chart and you can see

321
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,320
there's a plethora of opportunities to

322
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
to study with all these different pairs

323
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,399
and it gives you a context to actually

324
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,920
look into the marketplace with a

325
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,959
specific mindset not just waiting for a

326
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
neon sign to jump off at you and say

327
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
okay

328
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
well i wonder what i should do today

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
you'll know what levels to trade off of

330
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
relative to the monthly chart and it's

331
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,480
basically a top-down approach

332
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,720
that leads you right into trade setups

333
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
that you otherwise wouldn't know they

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,079
were there
