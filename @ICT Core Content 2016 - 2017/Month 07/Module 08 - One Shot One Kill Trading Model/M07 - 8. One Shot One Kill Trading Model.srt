1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,900
okay folks welcome to lesson eight uh

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,240
one shot one kill trading model

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,100
for the short term Trading

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,160
module for ICT mentorship this is the

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,840
last of March's content

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,480
okay one shot one kill setups

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,040
what does it require to do these

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,219
efficiently and successfully

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,440
well first you have to know all the

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,899
macro conditions and all the January

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,800
content lessons

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,120
you have to be proficient with

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,680
understanding the if the data ranges

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,719
looking back at the last 20 40 and 60

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
trading days

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,640
looking for PD array Matrix Concepts

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,800
applied to both time and price

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
you need the understanding of position

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,460
trading logical Concepts

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,619
you need to understand the swing trading

21
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,520
module Concepts

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,760
the short-term trading tutorials on the

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,600
ICT website

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,420
the power 3 concept applied to weekly

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,580
candles or ranges

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,020
and I'll talk about that in a few

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,439
moments

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,520
the intraday Concepts from ICT day

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,360
trading modules

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,380
day of week concept

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,659
looking for the high or low to form on

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,299
Monday through Wednesday with a 76 odds

33
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,960
of it happening

34
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,400
using fibs for targeting and

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
understanding the correct price points

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,079
time of day or ICT kill zones for

37
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,880
entries on one shot one kill setups

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,579
and you need to know the seasonal change

39
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,439
that may impact or frame directional

40
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,920
setups

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
and lastly you need to understand the

42
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,580
CRT or commitment of Traders analysis

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,220
and Commercial hedging programs

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,680
now

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,540
I said when we started this mentorship

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,700
that this was intended to fill in the

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,099
gaps that I purposely left

48
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,260
in all my free tutorials

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,540
now if you've gone through the

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,540
mentorship so far and you've not really

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,300
studied all of my free tutorials that

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,920
are on my website

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,980
now's where you're going to feel that

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,900
sting of having never done it

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,879
it was intended and I've told you before

56
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,580
the prerequisite is to know those free

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,720
tutorials

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
everything that I'm going to show you in

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,540
this module is really just a quick fill

60
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,280
in the gaps and then you'll understand

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,860
how it is I do one shot one kill the

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,739
gaps that remain for this month are

63
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,379
filled in with the intraday Concepts

64
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,660
for day trading

65
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,720
and it just basically helps you get more

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,379
precise do you need it not necessarily

67
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,980
well you want it most likely

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,620
so if you've gone this far and you

69
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,540
really want to know all the intricate

70
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,300
details about how I finally narrowed

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,140
down very tight small risk high yield

72
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,200
setups like you've seen now lined and

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,580
mapped out this week with the euro

74
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,840
dollar

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,200
yeah you need the intraday Concepts to

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,840
get that precise but you don't need it

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,480
to do one shot one kill because you

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,260
don't need here's other things that uh

79
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,720
help you get close to but not that

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
precise

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,720
that's already been showed in the

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,099
content for this month and the previous

83
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,959
months

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,260
now as it relates to the cot analysis

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,580
and Commercial hedging programs

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,379
obviously everyone's aware of the

87
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,720
commitment trades report where they plot

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
the net Trader's position of each

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
commercial and small Speculator and

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,420
large Trader and Larry Williams was the

91
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
first one to do real good work on that

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,739
back in the 70s

93
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,540
with his book uh how I made a million

94
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,120
dollars during Commodities last year

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,940
but in my own study I believe I've taken

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,220
it to another level no one else does

97
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,360
what I do with the CO2 data

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
and I'm going to show you again this

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,100
module and it's teaching how it is that

100
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,259
I uh incorporate that information now

101
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,759
when we get to the commodity section

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
later on this year when I'm teaching the

103
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,900
Commodities I'll actually show you how

104
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,840
to go in and construct the

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
commercial hedgers program and how to

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,680
look for a high probability setups using

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
the information but I'm going to give

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,699
you one set up in here for the euro

109
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,020
dollar that was just like a no-brainer

110
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,419
so you'll see why this week was just

111
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,520
pretty much

112
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,020
no problem at all knowing that it was

113
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,979
going to come down like it did

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
all right so the one shot one killed

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
trade procedure okay this is kind of

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,880
like a

117
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
back of a matchbook idea just real quick

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,820
short and what I mean by that is you

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,160
should already know a majority of what

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,979
I'm going to refer to here procedurally

121
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,600
so this is the reason why you need to

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,340
have a mentorship this is the reason why

123
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,080
you have to have a modular approach to

124
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,900
learning because there's such a vast

125
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,419
amount of information that you need to

126
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,880
be aware of you just simply can't make a

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,199
video and here it is here's how you

128
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,280
trade

129
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
for those that have gone through all of

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,940
my free tutorials and this far in the

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,340
mentorship you can now think about how

132
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,039
much information you now have

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
now you probably flounder for a little

134
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,720
while wondering you know do I have too

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,400
much information do I have analysis

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,440
paralysis and it's simply because you

137
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,660
haven't had a procedural way of using

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,680
all the information

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,320
so we've gone through a lot of content

140
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,900
between the free tutorials since 2010

141
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,979
all the way to now now through

142
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,160
2016-2017 Circa you are now learning all

143
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,139
of the procedural things that fills in

144
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,300
the gaps and by the time you end this

145
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,919
mentorship you'll know everything there

146
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,840
is to know about ICT Concepts and how to

147
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,039
apply it

148
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,840
but the first thing we do

149
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,060
when we look at our market and we're

150
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,220
going to use euro dollar as our example

151
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,319
we're going to determine the current or

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,539
potential next quarterly shift remember

153
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,280
that we talked about that in January

154
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,780
we're going to identify the higher time

155
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,539
frame PD arrays in the ipta data ranges

156
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,580
again that's content from January

157
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,199
we're going to refer to the interest

158
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,900
rate differentials and Market profile of

159
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,000
the rates in other words our interest

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,440
rates or treasuries or the the Bund

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,139
are those markets trending

162
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,660
or are they stuck in a consolidation

163
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,160
if they're trending then you're going to

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
get movement permitted in the euro

165
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,220
dollar

166
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,560
if they're Consolidated and tight it's

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,759
going to be very hard for the market to

168
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,060
move around

169
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,240
we're going to be scouting seasonals

170
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,580
throughout the calendar year that offer

171
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,220
High odds of a move going higher or

172
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,539
lower based on the seasonal tenancy

173
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,080
respectively

174
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
we're going to use swing analysis on

175
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,220
price action on higher time frames down

176
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,740
to the 60 Minute chart

177
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,880
so in other words what we're doing is

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,259
we're classifying all the price swings

179
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,259
we're looking at all the fractals and we

180
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,960
went over how larger Trends have smaller

181
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,639
swings that break into smaller swings

182
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,440
that break into smaller swings first an

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,660
Impulse swing then an expansion swing

184
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,479
after the retracement so by looking at

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
the market in a euro dollar and breaking

186
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
that down we can come to the conclusion

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,460
of what price swings we're going to use

188
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,440
for projections measurements and

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,220
retracements

190
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,900
we're going to anticipate specific

191
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,199
weekly profiles that may unfold based on

192
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,300
our analysis if we're looking for lower

193
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,940
prices as we're going to justify in this

194
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
teaching we're going to be looking for

195
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,979
specific Market

196
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,520
templates if you will that allow bearish

197
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,319
ideas so the first thing you would look

198
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,879
for is the Monday high of the week

199
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,680
Tuesday high of the week Wednesday

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,020
reversal those types of scenarios

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,360
then by identifying those respective

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,399
templates for the week we're going to be

203
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,020
looking at the market maker manipulation

204
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,299
templates to have the respective profile

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,079
characteristics

206
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,620
then you determine where the premium and

207
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,540
discount ranges are in price action

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
and you're going to wait for volatility

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,040
to Signal a high odds of a large range

210
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,660
being created

211
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,459
in other words when range expansion

212
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,959
should ensue

213
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,959
small ranges we got large ranges if the

214
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,700
Market's in big ranges we know there's

215
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,959
going to be a high probability for the

216
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,000
market to go quiet we want to be getting

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
in the market as quiet so that we can

218
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,980
expand and get larger ranges and big

219
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,459
volatility

220
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,140
we're going to refer to cot which is

221
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,019
commitment of Traders in the commercials

222
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,060
versus the large Traders

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,980
and open interest to confirm smart money

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,399
action

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,140
we look to frame a low resistance

226
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,680
liquidity run with opposing PD arrays or

227
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
for bearish we're looking to sell short

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,779
at a premium PDA

229
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,820
and then we're going to be looking at

230
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,880
a discount PDA to pair it up with

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,459
we're going to use fibs converging with

232
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,399
opposing PD arrays and blending it with

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,440
time and price

234
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,820
in other words what I'm looking for is

235
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,000
the Fibonacci level that overlaps with

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,279
a logical discount PD array

237
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,279
and we'll be confirming our trade setups

238
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,720
with inter-market analysis

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,279
all right so we're looking at our one

240
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
shot one kill set up on a euro dollar

241
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
now this was

242
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,640
provided to you this week the time of

243
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,959
this recording the last week of March

244
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,360
2017. I outlined through Twitter and

245
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,399
tweets the

246
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,940
basis of expecting a high the form in

247
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,740
the euro dollar around the 109

248
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,839
08 level

249
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,180
that was the level I called and the

250
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,519
actual high was 109.09 on the Forex

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,940
ltd's platform

252
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,920
I projected a low of the week at 106.50

253
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,779
that could have rolled over into Monday

254
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,160
but throughout the week I gave a

255
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
1-0

256
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,040
6.95

257
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
low objective

258
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,240
and then ultimately at the very last

259
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,060
minute of the day on Friday's close uh

260
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,459
they pushed the euro dollar down

261
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,820
to

262
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,000
106.55 now our objective is 106.50 if

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
that's what we're looking for we add

264
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,820
five Pips To That

265
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,279
that would have been uh your objective

266
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,279
used in your own platform some Trump

267
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,040
traders in my own live feeds I got down

268
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,899
to

269
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,180
106.497 I'll leave it up to you to

270
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,940
determine what you know what your data

271
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,160
provider allowed for the low of the week

272
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,579
for euro dollar but uh for the Forex LTD

273
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,940
it didn't make it down to 106.50 but I'm

274
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,320
suspecting it's probably going to open

275
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,959
up lower on Sunday

276
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,660
that's coming this weekend and then

277
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,940
obviously uh you know that would fulfill

278
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,040
the whole

279
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,100
projected uh swing but we're gonna go

280
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,740
into great detail about all this amount

281
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,480
apart from what's already been shared in

282
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
this chart here I'm not going to rehash

283
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
what was already talked about in this

284
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,860
week's teachings in the videos and and

285
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,920
commentary because that is in my opinion

286
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,560
a gold mine and you need to go through

287
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,040
those notes as well but what framed this

288
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,100
whole move and how I knew that the high

289
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
could most likely be formed on Monday

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,660
and we would look for a low 106.50

291
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,100
we're going to go into details about

292
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,579
that now

293
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,420
okay so the first thing we're looking

294
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,839
for is we're expecting either uh up move

295
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,579
or a down move so how do we start doing

296
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,860
that well we go to our seasonal tenancy

297
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,220
okay if you're a sports fan you'd like

298
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,760
to go and watch a specific sports team

299
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,440
like the baseball season or football

300
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,839
season you can actually track when those

301
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,399
teams play and what days and the

302
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,660
calendar days and all that and you know

303
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,300
when they're going to play they have a

304
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,120
they have a schedule they have to keep

305
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,860
well the markets almost have like a

306
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,500
built-in generic schedule as well and

307
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
and is followed or tracked by way of

308
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,839
using a seasonal tendency now I shared

309
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,579
these seasonal Tendencies with you so

310
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,220
far in the mentorship and what we do is

311
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,620
we look for times where the market has a

312
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,579
real clear indication in both the long

313
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,560
term and short-term

314
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
basically the blue and the red lines

315
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
they have to agree with a directional

316
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,620
bias and when they move in the same

317
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,579
direction

318
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,740
red and blue

319
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,600
if they move in concert with one another

320
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,700
we have a really strong tendency to see

321
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,160
that market generally move in that same

322
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,019
direction

323
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,940
what we're going to focus on here is the

324
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,339
month of March as you can see it

325
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,339
initially starts off with a rally up

326
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,380
into the middle of March and then it

327
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,420
declines to the last week of March going

328
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,519
into the first week of April

329
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,980
so our tendency is to see the euro

330
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,839
dollar going lower

331
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,519
so we have a strong seasonal tendency

332
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,260
for bearish prices for euro dollar

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,060
now we're going to go over to the

334
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,980
commitment of Traders hedging program

335
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,079
now you're not going to find this on the

336
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,399
internet there's nothing talked about

337
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
it's not in books I swear to the Lord

338
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,260
Almighty there's nothing out there like

339
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,600
what I'm showing you here okay what I do

340
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,820
is I use the information from the

341
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,600
community Traders report and I make a

342
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
new

343
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,120
way of uh creating a zero-sum line so

344
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,100
what I do is I look at the last year

345
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,320
okay and I get the highest high and the

346
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,139
lowest low of their commercial

347
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,639
activity in other words I'm only

348
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,380
tracking commercials and I'll show you

349
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,060
how to create all this and make it for

350
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,320
yourself it's

351
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
um a complete bull in our group have

352
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
emailed me asking for this specific

353
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,160
indicator there is no indicator okay

354
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,139
what I actually do is I actually create

355
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,500
this with paint okay I grab the

356
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,660
information and then I actually by hand

357
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,279
create it and I know what you're

358
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,680
thinking well I track 39 markets Michael

359
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,540
there's no way I'm going to keep up with

360
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,740
that well that's your fault you should

361
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,560
be tracking 39 markets but when I focus

362
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,420
on the two pairs that I like which is

363
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,279
Euro and cable it takes literally

364
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,079
seconds for me to do this and it's not a

365
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,420
big deal but if you're going to be that

366
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,820
hard up about it I'm sure some of you

367
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,519
that are in our group

368
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,740
um are capable of programming something

369
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm certain of it but uh once you learn

370
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,000
how to do that when we do go into our

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
commodity teaching I'll leave it up to

372
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,440
you uh you smart whippersnappers to

373
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,660
throw something together maybe for mt4

374
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,360
platforms it can uh you know provide us

375
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,399
a real quick easy way of doing it and

376
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,199
then you can go back to trading you know

377
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
um team number of pairs with the

378
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,600
information

379
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,079
but what I do is I look at the hedging

380
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,720
program that is

381
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,940
illustrated by looking at the last

382
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,120
calendar year so I rollback data for 12

383
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,920
months and I look at the highest high

384
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,839
and the lowest low in their net

385
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,060
positions of the commercials only I'm

386
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,500
not looking at the large Traders or the

387
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,699
small spec I don't really care what the

388
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,339
small specs are doing but when we track

389
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,800
commitment to Traders report data or cot

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
data

391
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
every week this uh cftc commodity

392
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
Futures Trading commission requires

393
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,220
traders that trade at a reportable level

394
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,660
to report whether they're buying or

395
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,720
selling and the net positions that are

396
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
held because commercial Traders are like

397
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,380
Banks and large institutions and

398
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,079
manufacturers of goods or commodities

399
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,320
there are groups that produce

400
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
their commercial level and there are

401
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,500
groups that are consuming or

402
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,240
um

403
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,079
resellers okay so there are users and

404
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,420
creators of the commodity on a

405
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,339
commercial level and based on that

406
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,660
there's always going to be buying and

407
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,300
selling on a commercial basis the net

408
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,620
positions

409
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,679
okay are the collective whole of all

410
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,540
their total buys and all their total

411
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,299
sales and what are they more net long or

412
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,579
net short as a basis

413
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,140
and what I do is I take that information

414
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140
that comes by way of the cftc

415
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,619
and I plot this graph here by simply

416
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,500
using a website and the information and

417
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,780
just basically throwing in some lipstick

418
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,020
and it helps me visually see what the

419
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,940
commercials are doing in terms of

420
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,679
hedging

421
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,700
as you can see at the time of this week

422
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,200
the commercials which is tracked by this

423
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
line as it's below the zero line okay

424
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
it's going to be marked red that's going

425
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,520
to be bearish when it's above the zero

426
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,600
line

427
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,340
they're net long that would be bullish

428
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,140
okay and back below the zero line

429
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,000
which would be represented between 100

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
and K and 50k okay that that line I have

431
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
drawn in there that blue line that

432
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,580
represents the new zero line that would

433
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,140
otherwise be viewed like a regular

434
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,059
commitment shares report

435
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,980
you don't need to see that as

436
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm going to teach later on but I've

437
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,360
shown this in uh real quick

438
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,700
short sessions throughout my time

439
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,620
teaching but I'm going to give you the

440
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,539
details about how to use it in great

441
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,179
detail about how I break it down there's

442
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,919
actual seasonal Tendencies to their

443
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,120
hedging programs that you'll actually

444
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,740
look at too and there's seasonal

445
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,940
tendencies that go along with open

446
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,220
interest declines as well and that's

447
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,720
really neat information you need to know

448
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,380
that to do Mega trades Mega trades are

449
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,820
like huge big moves that take place

450
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,799
every year there's like two or three of

451
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,240
them that really explode you want to be

452
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,620
focusing on markets that give you those

453
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,679
types of conditions but I'm digressing

454
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,660
so let me get back to a discussion with

455
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,860
the euro dollar

456
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,280
at the time of this week the euro dollar

457
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
was making a higher high than that of in

458
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,700
January

459
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
but look at the commercials they were

460
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,080
hedging against those rallies and they

461
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
really went that short selling

462
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,940
aggressively in the rally above the

463
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,520
January High and the December high of

464
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,440
2016.

465
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,640
so as we made a higher high in the euro

466
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
the commercials are actually selling

467
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,840
aggressively in that rally so what are

468
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,640
we seeing here a seasonal tendency

469
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,340
that's highly probable for lower Euro

470
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,299
prices

471
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,480
at the same time commercials are looking

472
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,900
to sell short or they want to exceed

473
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,940
prices going lower why because they're

474
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,559
hedging against that rally

475
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,900
they're selling into that rally why

476
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,340
would they want to do that I don't know

477
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,840
they're Banks they do it all the time

478
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,179
but logically over a period of time

479
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,980
looking at it you'll see that they kind

480
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,500
of put the brakes on a market rally by

481
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,600
selling aggressively into it

482
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,640
and that caps the market as you've seen

483
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,500
here this week so we had a blending of

484
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,860
two things commercial Short Selling

485
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,840
now if you look at a regular commitment

486
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,220
Traders report

487
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,299
you're not going to see that you're

488
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,860
going to see them net long

489
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,799
that's what screws everybody up even

490
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,900
Larry Williams because they're looking

491
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,580
at information because they're looking

492
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,240
at Price through cot data from an

493
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
archaic caveman approach now I'm not

494
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,500
saying it can't be used efficiently and

495
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,840
effectively in certain conditions like

496
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,580
it's traditionally taught through Larry

497
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,020
Williams and everybody else is used now

498
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,120
but if it was just that easy everybody

499
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,760
was making money right so why is it that

500
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,799
commercials aren't on the first of

501
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,900
everyone's list because nobody knows how

502
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,980
to use it

503
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
but you're learning how to do it now

504
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,700
because you're in the click you're in

505
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,380
the mentorship that teaches you

506
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,539
everything about smart money

507
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,320
so what we do is we use this graph okay

508
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,660
that you're going to learn about in the

509
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,120
commodity section of this teachings

510
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,740
that's later on in the months I think

511
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,419
it's in June

512
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,120
but I'll teach you how to use the

513
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,559
hedging program and actually look for

514
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,780
seasonal Tendencies for when they would

515
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,640
really be buying or selling

516
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,799
certain times of the year and also their

517
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,419
seasonal Tendencies of open interest but

518
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,100
open interest is not that important here

519
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,080
because we have two things Blended

520
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,760
together and you really only need two

521
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,340
things to couple for smart money you

522
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,440
have the seasonal tendency just in other

523
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,539
words there's a seasonal influence that

524
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,340
usually see zero dollar and I don't know

525
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,840
what it is I don't need to know

526
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,960
seasonally historically euro dollar

527
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,320
drops down in the second half of March

528
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,840
going into April okay so we're looking

529
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
for that seasonal tendency to take place

530
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,799
not by itself but we're looking for

531
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,840
technicals to support that idea well we

532
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,980
can see here the commercials were

533
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,320
heavily net selling into that rally

534
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,840
we've seen last week leading into

535
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,940
Monday's rally initially for this week

536
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,280
and the euro dollar and then it topped

537
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,440
and tanked going lower

538
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,900
you can see right here that new high or

539
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,980
high

540
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,919
has been met with heavy net selling by

541
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
the commercial Traders

542
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,840
this is smart money shorting

543
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,299
so now how do we go in and justify these

544
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,520
ideas just because we have a chart that

545
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,980
looks like it indicates that commercials

546
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,360
are selling and we look at a seasonal

547
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,500
tenants just because season Tendencies

548
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,600
are suggesting higher or lower price it

549
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
does not mean that it's going to happen

550
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,740
there has to be something lining up

551
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,200
technically to get in sync with the

552
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,840
markets and seasonal tendency so it's

553
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,700
not a seasonal tendency be all end-all

554
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,400
it has to happen no seasonal tendency

555
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
illustrates a probable condition or a

556
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,140
probable outcome for the market

557
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,419
Direction but without technicals

558
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,100
aligning with that in a market

559
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,440
environment that supports that idea the

560
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,940
seasonal tendency will get you in

561
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,380
trouble

562
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,360
so we're looking at the dollar Index

563
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
here

564
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,179
we're going to frame out the market

565
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,820
conditions from a macro standpoint and

566
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,260
we're going to look at the next

567
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,880
quarterly shift and we're going to look

568
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,820
at how the markets should be moving and

569
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,440
we're seeing here on a weekly chart for

570
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,080
the dollar Index we have an old

571
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,260
high and now this is whereas price is

572
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,419
trading down to it

573
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,760
for this uh this week we've traded down

574
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,179
into an old weekly High which makes this

575
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,380
a discount PD array

576
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,240
and we move down into a daily time frame

577
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
and we can actually see another

578
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,580
level that is a old mitigation block

579
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,820
and it comes in at 98.92

580
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,740
now if you look at that level you would

581
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,659
obviously suspect that it's going to go

582
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,320
to what we round up so it'd be 98.95 you

583
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,260
can go to 98.90 if you want to because

584
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,880
it's only like two Pips but generally

585
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,280
the rules are we round up to the nearest

586
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,299
five or zero level

587
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,419
and then breaking it down into a hourly

588
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,179
chart dollar Index we can see that this

589
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,280
is again

590
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
illustrating the

591
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,179
potential weekly range

592
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,640
and we're looking for price to reach up

593
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
from this discount level we saw on the

594
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,059
weekly chart

595
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,179
we're looking for premium PDF PD arrays

596
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,940
so we go through our Market looking at

597
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,520
where liquidity pools are bearish order

598
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,880
blocks fair value gaps mitigation blocks

599
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,419
Breakers old highs and old lows that act

600
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,520
as resistance

601
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,640
as you can see here we have a few noted

602
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,220
each one of these were draws on price

603
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,320
and you can see they are all traded to

604
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,179
with no problem with the exception of

605
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,340
the fair value Gap I suspect next week

606
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,620
maybe even on Sunday we'll probably see

607
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,380
a gap up on Sunday's trading that

608
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,820
remains to be seen but it certainly

609
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,520
looks like it wants to do that and if it

610
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,440
doesn't Gap up we'll look for it to

611
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
expand through Sunday into Monday into

612
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,260
that fair value Gap

613
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,159
okay and getting a better look at the

614
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
dollar Index this is an hourly chart

615
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,700
what I have here is I have the

616
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,799
equilibrium price point

617
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,380
identified so anything above the

618
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,600
equilibrium price point is going to be a

619
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,159
premium and anything below it is going

620
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,900
to be a discount so now what we're doing

621
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,080
is we added the PD array Matrix

622
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
in the form of our premium and discount

623
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,000
ranges so now we can see graphically

624
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
thinking like an algorithmic Trader so

625
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,980
we're getting in sync with the algorithm

626
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,260
ifta is going to pull and draw a price

627
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,620
up to these levels logically to allow

628
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,100
the bank traders to to put on trades or

629
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,760
manage their in-house book so looking at

630
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,860
what's going on in this chart we can see

631
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,480
clearly that the market has been drawn

632
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,299
back up to equilibrium so you're always

633
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,679
going to look for discounts at least try

634
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,200
to pull to equilibrium then it has to

635
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
determine if it wants to go into premium

636
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,520
or it could go back down deeper into a

637
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,659
discount

638
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,640
you never know that for sure but you

639
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,100
need to blend time and price with the

640
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,799
ifta data ranges looking back over the

641
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
last 20 40 and 60 days

642
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,919
also adding the PD array Matrix as we

643
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,440
have here and we have all of the PD

644
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,960
arrays noted that would be needed for

645
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,679
this idea

646
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,700
now we're going to look at the Euro

647
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
pound because we have to have

648
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,820
inter-market analysis supported as well

649
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,340
so we've seen the dollar Index

650
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,740
poised to go higher it's trading off of

651
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,080
weekly discount PD array and we have all

652
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,340
the premium

653
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,799
PD arrays above us noted in the previous

654
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,940
chart

655
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,299
that would be drawing price higher so if

656
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,100
we're looking for weak euro dollar

657
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,039
prices we need to see if the Euro pound

658
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,500
would support that idea as well and you

659
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,080
can see obviously the European has

660
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,980
tanked it went down to a very clear

661
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,320
logical bullish order block

662
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
on a four hour basis a series of downed

663
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,059
candles sets the tone for that bullish

664
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:00,059
order block so that is a discount PD

665
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,580
array it trades right down to it at

666
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,940
Friday's close but all throughout

667
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,059
the week we saw the Euro pound

668
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,580
be aggressively sold off so that's going

669
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,340
to be week for euro dollar and strong

670
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,720
for pound dollar

671
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,080
okay so we're looking at the euro dollar

672
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,279
now

673
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
and we can see here the Monday we opened

674
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,120
up with a gap

675
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,620
well actually it's Sunday we opened up

676
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,419
the Gap and traded higher throughout

677
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,500
Monday

678
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,220
and we traded up into the weekly bearish

679
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,320
order block for the euro dollar and I'll

680
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
leave you to look at your weekly bearish

681
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,059
order block on your own platform

682
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,620
but this is the only level that was

683
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,120
missing from this week's discussion

684
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,100
because I want to be able to have some

685
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,980
meat for this teaching but uh weekly

686
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,140
bearish order block was traded into on

687
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,520
Monday

688
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
and the question is how far into the

689
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,779
weekly order block would you expect it

690
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,279
to trade into Michael

691
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,860
well we're going to that in in the last

692
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,380
slide for this teaching but

693
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,380
we're going to assume that you have

694
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,380
studied the weekly templates that expect

695
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,240
specific

696
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,179
trading characteristics you know what

697
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,460
days make a specific higher low of the

698
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,860
week you know how the markets trade you

699
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,480
know relative to the respective

700
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,179
templates and then what manipulation do

701
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,340
we expect by the market makers with that

702
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,460
specific template well since I elected

703
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,400
to use the bearish idea that euro dollar

704
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,659
is going to go lower because the dollar

705
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,880
Index was bullish okay or should have

706
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,100
been bullish trading off of its weekly

707
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,659
discount PD array

708
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,640
couple that with we have seasonal

709
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,919
tendency for euro dollar to decline

710
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,679
we had commercials supporting lower

711
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
prices with heavy selling into the rally

712
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,600
we have

713
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,640
the condition

714
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,220
for lower expectation

715
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,980
in pricing on your dollar

716
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,659
that means we're going to be expecting

717
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,679
either Monday Tuesday or Wednesday to be

718
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,600
the high of the week so you always

719
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,039
obviously start with the first day of

720
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,360
the week which is going to be the Monday

721
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,200
okay so price opens up on Sunday gaps up

722
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,640
and it starts trading immediately right

723
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,960
up on Monday

724
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,500
so right away we have to assume that

725
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,659
Monday is going to be the high of the

726
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:25,440
week

727
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,240
so what we do is we go through the

728
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,080
procedures of potentially

729
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,120
picking the high of the week now we

730
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,220
don't try to go in here and and time

731
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,320
that Weekly High we don't try to do that

732
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,600
now you can over time do that yourself

733
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,399
but initially you don't you want to

734
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,320
teach yourself to trust these Concepts

735
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,539
okay because it can go up on Tuesday and

736
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,700
make a higher high that's why you have

737
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,159
to give it a little bit of leeway now

738
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,740
you can sell us a very small portion on

739
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,640
Monday

740
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,440
and then if Tuesday fails to make a

741
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,820
higher high at least you have a small

742
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,980
piece on the higher level

743
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,980
but if it does go higher on Tuesday

744
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,080
for Wednesday at least you're not going

745
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,179
to be at a full position underwater as

746
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,980
it makes a higher high on those later

747
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,640
days in the week

748
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,880
what we do is on the Monday

749
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,940
we look for price to trade up and then

750
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,240
have a retracement intraday so you can

751
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,299
see the London session

752
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,899
had a retracement and then an expansion

753
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:29,039
all through New York

754
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,260
what I did was I measured the swing

755
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,779
using the Fib from the high formed in

756
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,559
London down to the retracement low

757
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,380
prior to the New York session rally and

758
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,000
what I did was I measured That Swing

759
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,880
intraday and it gave me

760
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,039
the

761
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,539
109.09 level

762
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,240
so I do is I used one pit below that and

763
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,000
called it 109.08 because generally I'm

764
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,960
usually one pip off and in this case I

765
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,179
was one pip off still one pip short

766
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,799
because I thought I was making a

767
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,899
compensation for it but it actually went

768
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,720
right to the level of 109.09 at least on

769
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,539
Forex ltd's platform

770
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,820
so by doing that what we end up doing is

771
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,559
we can see

772
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,320
a way of projecting the weekly High

773
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,600
using the intraday stuff that we'll

774
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,059
actually teach in April and you'll be

775
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,320
able to combine a lot of other things

776
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,340
with time of day and specific uh

777
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,380
measurements that I use to to more or

778
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,799
less nail down the power three or dare I

779
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,620
say it weekly Judas swing so the initial

780
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,600
rally here we saw on Monday was a false

781
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,179
rally all that was was Heavy selling the

782
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,399
engineered price higher built in a

783
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,460
premium so they can sell it to the smart

784
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
or lower

785
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,500
intelligent crowd obviously the lower

786
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,779
intelligent crowd smart money sells it

787
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,640
to lesser informed money and that's what

788
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,240
we saw on Monday

789
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,279
so it takes us to the euro dollar we're

790
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,799
in the four hour chart you can see the

791
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,860
PD array in the discount Zone you can

792
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,299
see that liquidity void that we

793
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,020
identified here and at 106.50 level

794
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,659
so using the 10650 level as our Baseline

795
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,779
drawing up from that point and our

796
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,240
projected high of the week at 109.08

797
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,880
which is what I called that's our range

798
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,860
and then we can divide that in half get

799
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,960
an equilibrium price point and having

800
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
that we can now have a premium and

801
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,520
discount PD array Matrix then you start

802
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,980
breaking down your markets

803
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,340
PD array for premium and discount

804
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,799
we know that we have a liquidity void in

805
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,100
the lower end of the discount range so

806
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,360
that's what we're aiming for that's what

807
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,980
we are aiming for

808
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,740
we came out of a premium Market at

809
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,899
109.08

810
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:52,320
and as the market traded lower each one

811
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,880
of the respective

812
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,559
PD arrays gaps

813
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,419
liquidity pools

814
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,480
old highs to sell into bearish order

815
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,919
blocks all those things as the market

816
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,440
slid lower they were all contributing

817
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,419
factors as we mentioned throughout the

818
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,640
analysis this week through tweets and in

819
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,340
video production and on the daily chart

820
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,100
indexes

821
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,080
blending all these things together all

822
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
these things that I taught conceptually

823
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,399
the way you get to the results that you

824
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,440
saw this week is you have to use them

825
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,539
you have to practice with them there's

826
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,960
not going to be a clear cut this is how

827
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,820
you do it every single time there's

828
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,779
going to be

829
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,340
potential decisions that you're gonna

830
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,320
have to make you might think that it's

831
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,340
going to be the high of the week on

832
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,120
Monday

833
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,700
and you sell short and then Tuesday in

834
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,799
London or New York it runs up here and

835
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,840
blows that high out are you going to

836
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,360
stick with the idea and expect lower

837
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,820
prices still or are you going to be

838
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,399
whipsauled and thinking okay I was wrong

839
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,720
and they go long

840
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,940
that's going to be a demon for you to

841
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,860
wrestle with so you have to come to a

842
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,840
conclusion of what you want to do for

843
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,460
the week and come hell or high water

844
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,860
stick to that until it no longer makes

845
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
sense and that happens mid week and you

846
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,839
learned in the previous lesson that

847
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,719
there's many times a weekly reversal so

848
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,060
you always have a potential to mess it

849
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,839
up

850
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,599
this is what makes it difficult but it's

851
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,659
so easy to do how's that for an oxymoron

852
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,139
the point is is in this teaching we have

853
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,239
a way of looking at Price blending

854
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,820
Concepts together using experience

855
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,300
obviously okay but over time seeing it

856
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,820
studying in hindsight you can look at 10

857
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,699
15 20 years worth of data and get to

858
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,699
these outcomes okay through study and

859
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:46,020
build yourself a a library mentally with

860
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,359
past experiences using the information

861
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,219
you don't need to have every little

862
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,020
thing down to an hourly chart you don't

863
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,839
need that you can see the outcome based

864
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,780
on a daily chart you can see it

865
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,880
so

866
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm going to counsel you to use this as

867
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
an example of how we can take the

868
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,420
information

869
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,460
blend it together

870
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,040
and then come up with the

871
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,380
nearest thing to Perfection you're going

872
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,260
to ever see in market analysis

873
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,119
being one pip off from the high of the

874
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,820
week and only five Pips off the low of

875
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,839
the week but in most platforms 106.50

876
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,099
was hit with real-time data not demo and

877
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,680
the high of the week was uh you know it

878
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,119
was called and the lower leak was called

879
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,940
so I'll leave it up to you to determine

880
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,339
whether or not this is something that

881
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,579
leads you to more proficiency as a

882
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,359
Trader or does it create new barriers

883
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,760
for your learning I think that if you go

884
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
through the concepts and especially when

885
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,420
you finish the mentorship you want to go

886
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,800
back through all the lessons again

887
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,140
listen to all that boring stuff I talked

888
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,060
about in January go back through all the

889
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,859
lessons in September October November

890
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,599
and December and use all that

891
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,339
information I helped pull all the free

892
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,579
tutorials together back then some of you

893
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,440
were complaining about that now you're

894
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
seeing the fruits of having done that

895
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,400
and

896
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,780
if you haven't watched the free

897
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,599
tutorials more than one time at the end

898
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,740
of this mentorship you want to do that

899
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,780
all over again okay so that way it kind

900
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,000
of completes your whole learning and by

901
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,040
then you have everything you ever need

902
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,900
to know you'll know procedurally what

903
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,880
you need to do and yes it requires a lot

904
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,920
of work it's going to require you to

905
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,359
think it's going to require you to come

906
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,300
to the decision and it's not going to be

907
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,339
black and white it's not going to be

908
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,220
this or that initially but when we get

909
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,420
to August

910
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,579
there's a specific procedure that you go

911
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,160
through from the top down okay and it

912
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,859
leads you to specific decision points

913
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,079
that tells you okay right now I think

914
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,480
this is what I should be doing

915
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,339
regardless of what discipline or Trader

916
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,839
you're going to be it starts from the

917
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,640
higher time frame position Traders

918
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,760
mindset as you would do with one shot

919
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,579
one kill and you reduce it down

920
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,500
and you reduce it down to swing trading

921
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,720
and you reduce it down to short-term

922
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,160
trading you need to reduce it down to

923
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,200
day trading so you can get that real low

924
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,260
risk real tight precision and if you

925
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,700
