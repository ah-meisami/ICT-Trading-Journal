1
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,240
welcome back folks

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
all right so we're doing a short little

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,359
market review

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,140
dollar Index euro dollar and s p and

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,019
NASDAQ futures

6
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,940
so dollar Index is our weekly chart here

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,860
you can see I mentioned this

8
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,860
last week is a a point of

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,219
consideration for a discount

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,399
and while it looks like it touched it it

11
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,219
was one pipette short of touching the

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,260
the high

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,079
which is the actual low of this

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,420
weekly candle here you can find that

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,340
with the week

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,840
represented by the date here okay

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,700
so far we're working up into this city

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,799
this is a sell side imbalance buy side

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,780
and efficiency

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,260
I'm watching how we trade in this area

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,700
right here

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,299
okay so if we watch

23
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,420
two price points that I'm keeping a

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,100
close eye on which is the consequent

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
encouragement of this candle's Wick

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,780
which is midpoint right here

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,920
and the same thing here

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,720
so midpoint of that Wick

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,579
extend those two out

30
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,079
I want you to do that in your own chart

31
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,439
okay and how we trade if at all

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,420
and either one of these

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,550
that will be interesting to me

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,520
[Music]

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,280
dollar Index daily chart

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
okay so we see you can got real close to

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,040
it there I didn't quite get to it and

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,899
then now we have pulled up into this

39
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,340
efficiency there's a small little

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,040
Gap this is actually a real liquidity

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,380
void where there's no actual trading

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,500
printed between these two respective

43
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,360
candles this candle's high neck candles

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,140
low

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,580
so it'll be interesting to see if it

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
wants to get up

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,959
to reprice into this area right here

48
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,060
that little Gap right there

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,580
if it stays open and starts to trade

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,980
lower

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,959
this can be something

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
that can stay open for a long time

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,980
you're a Dollar weekly chart

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,900
all right so we have the weekly volume

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,459
and balance which is

56
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,620
the difference between this candle's

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
closing price and this candle's opening

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,120
price while we did have this

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,319
candlesticks tail

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
and this candle sticks Wick

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
overlap one another in here but I have

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,099
drawn your attention to and this was

63
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,080
ahead of time so it's not just right now

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,420
we've talked about this for

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,599
also for several months actually but the

66
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,099
difference between those two price

67
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,000
points is that there is no body

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,220
no Candlestick body on this time frame

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,620
so the weekly candlestick

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,720
while we did trade down with the

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,239
candlesticks Wick and the candlesticks

72
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,940
tail up here

73
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,879
whenever a market shows an unwillingness

74
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,459
to drop a body

75
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,739
between two respective candlesticks

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,760
that is a volume and balance okay so I

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,099
dubbed as a volumet balance because that

78
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,940
time frame to be efficiently delivered

79
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,980
okay so the algorithm will refer back to

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,379
weekly time frame

81
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,720
there's an inefficiency here everyone

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,099
else would not see this as an

83
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,500
inefficiency because they see that it

84
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,420
traded back and forth in here

85
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,159
that's not efficient

86
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,159
so the draw on liquidity that we've been

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,440
looking for for months has finally

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,459
been delivered

89
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,680
okay so the high of the week we opened

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,840
traded up just to the high that

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,939
inefficiency

92
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,180
which is the weekly volume and balance

93
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,699
and then we traded down near the close

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
of this

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,540
volume of ounce on the low end so we had

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,699
the high end of it and the low end of it

97
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,800
and the close was just about right at

98
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,880
the load

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
so we traded up

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,040
meant the high of it

101
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,120
and then close back down

102
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,000
on the daily chart on the euro dollar

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,860
you can see how we did in fact deliver

104
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,199
here

105
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
and painted right back down over top of

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
that range from the low of the weekly

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,620
volume of balance up to the high and

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,660
then back down again

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,120
we had several targets

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,460
from July 9th

111
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,199
analysis video you can find it on

112
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,400
YouTube

113
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,440
and you can see this is where it began

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,500
before this Candlestick started Trading

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,940
we were looking for a move back down

116
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,160
into the weekly inversion Gap and then

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,100
draw to buy side which it did here and

118
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,720
then draw up into the weekly volume

119
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
balance so this right here completes a

120
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,460
rather

121
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,680
obvious

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,139
illustration of what my Concepts can do

123
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,820
for you what you're looking for in terms

124
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,919
of precision why the price should behave

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,240
a specific way

126
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,460
and right now

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,199
at this juncture

128
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,759
it's important for you to realize

129
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,979
because you're all probably thinking I

130
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,440
just watched this Pan Am

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,960
I watched it on my own chart I had the

132
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,539
annotations had the expectation to see

133
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,639
it deliver and it delivered

134
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,460
now what's the next move ICT what's the

135
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,539
next thing

136
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,039
it's really important that you

137
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,320
understand that we don't have to pick

138
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,620
the next move right now in fact it can

139
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,220
go both directions it can go higher the

140
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,280
trade up into this Fairway Gap or it can

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,160
dig deeper into this inefficiency here

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,539
this is a buy side and balance outside

143
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,720
an efficiency this is a sibi sell sign

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,180
imbalance beside inefficiency

145
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,479
either one of those can be treated to

146
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,440
because of the 50 50

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
likelihood

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
then we have to do what we have to drop

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,479
down below the daily chart

150
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,180
and be a day trader trade the intraday

151
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,800
sessions

152
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,660
the London Open Session

153
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
the New York open session

154
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,880
[Music]

155
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,139
all right we can see the hourly chart

156
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,880
here on euro dollar

157
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,039
trade through the buy side

158
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,080
came up found some support at the low

159
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
end of that Weekly volume of balance

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
then trade it all out to the high

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,900
then broke down

162
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,979
and aggressively return to the low of

163
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,780
the weekly volume imbalance

164
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,699
so on the upside

165
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,620
you want to have

166
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
this inefficiency

167
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,300
and

168
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,539
this inefficiency both of those are

169
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,539
in terms of the premium and or discount

170
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,120
respectively those are the two areas of

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
interest for me

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,380
I don't want to be overzealous and say

173
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,599
something up here

174
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,500
or something down here

175
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,880
because I don't have Sunday's opening

176
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,139
price yet

177
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,080
right now the time is a little bit after

178
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,900
four o'clock my local time so I'm

179
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,120
keeping my cards close to my vest this

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,979
week and I'm going to allow Monday's

181
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,000
Trading

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
to give me more insights about the

183
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,259
weekly range so it's okay for you to not

184
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,139
know because sometimes I don't know

185
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,060
I never know what it's going to do when

186
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,280
we open up on Sunday Sunday's opening

187
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,340
price is a mystery it's absolutely

188
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,979
unknowable let's put it that way so you

189
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,080
have to submit yourself to not knowing

190
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,039
what it is

191
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,380
and then watching and seeing how we

192
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,020
behave after that new week opening

193
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,479
evening s p

194
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,419
on the left hand side weekly chart

195
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,720
NASDAQ mini futures

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,660
weekly chart on the right

197
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,220
all right so I mentioned that this

198
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,020
inefficiency here would be a likely

199
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,740
culprit to draw up into we did see that

200
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,860
last week this was the initial one here

201
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,719
which we saw that trade to and then went

202
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,800
through it foreign

203
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,020
gap which is what we've outlined also we

204
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,779
had an interest in that

205
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,940
weekly chart on NASDAQ I mentioned this

206
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,560
is likely to be

207
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
the upside draw as well and we got that

208
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,200
delivered last week as well

209
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,740
and off the heels of the weekly

210
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,959
Ferry Gap here in the discount so it

211
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,580
sent price higher

212
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,620
and while again I'm not trying to call

213
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,940
the top of the marketplace I'm not

214
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,380
trying to pick a top

215
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,740
it's in an area where I think it's

216
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,380
reasonable to see it come back down into

217
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,320
this inefficiency here and over here

218
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,660
respectively for the s p down into here

219
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,120
now if

220
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,700
we take out the down closed candle

221
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,680
on the weekly basis if we take out that

222
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,779
low then

223
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,420
I would submit to the idea that we're

224
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,700
probably creating an inmate term high on

225
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,680
the weekly chart for s p

226
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,580
same thing here if we trade below

227
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,339
the down closed candle here on a closing

228
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,500
basis so this is important man it has to

229
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,839
be on a closing basis both s p and

230
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,060
NASDAQ if it were to close below this

231
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,620
candle's low

232
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,640
then I would likely assume that we are

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
creating an intermediate term High not

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,300
that it's the top not that it can't go

235
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,980
higher later on in the year it just

236
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,600
means for right now it would change

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,160
gears for me

238
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,019
and then I would likely look for lower

239
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,519
time frame

240
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,920
cell setups

241
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,380
and focus there until I was shown that

242
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,180
the market did in fact want to return

243
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,800
back to being bullish but right now

244
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
everything's still bullish nothing here

245
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,220
indicates there's a top nothing

246
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,240
indicates here that there's a top either

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,860
all right s p on the left hand side

248
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,160
daily chart we have a immediate

249
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,920
rebalance which is this candle here and

250
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,200
then the next down close candle and then

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,320
we opened traded up to the previous a

252
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,800
closed candle and then rejected that

253
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,360
so unless it takes out Friday's High

254
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm looking for the likelihood of it

255
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,160
drawing back down into this

256
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
inefficiency here because we didn't

257
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,060
completely close it in see that

258
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,060
so it can trade down there and still be

259
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,360
bullish longer term it doesn't need to

260
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,399
change anything by doing that because

261
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,459
what we have here is a swing low

262
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,260
and trailed stop losses have been

263
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,760
brought right below that low

264
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,260
and we have a little bit of inefficiency

265
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,700
here between this candle is high and

266
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,800
this candle is low 

267
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,519
so it could trade down there and still not upset anything
and essentially that's the midpoint of that lower inefficiency on the weekly chart
so I can trade down here quick below this close in this entirely even go 
so far as to get down to CE from this Wick

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,380
and then I'd like to see this area down here stay open as a Breakaway Gap

277
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,860
so all of that changes if we trade on a

278
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,300
closing basis above Friday's High same

279
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,399
thing here on NASDAQ

280
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,839
we have

281
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,600
almost entirely closed in this fair

282
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
value Gap here but I'd like to see it

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,180
trade down into this area here into this

284
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,500
order block

285
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,420
so

286
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm expecting

287
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,220
and anticipating

288
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,279
and for my own analysis predicting that

289
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,380
we would likely trade down more into

290
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,360
this inefficiency now if we gap down

291
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,720
create a gap opening trade up and then

292
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,019
go lower then obviously that might

293
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,579
require a little bit more

294
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,620
movement into this order block maybe

295
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,120
mean threshold

296
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,640
right in here

297
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,500
so it's a lot of wait and see 
and it's always the case before we open up on Sunday 
so I can have a lot of different scenarios that I would favor 
or I would like to see or my concern would be around a specific

303
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,579
you know

304
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,260
scenario panning out and price on

305
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,399
Sunday's opening price going into

306
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,279
Monday's trading but all of that is just

307
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,720
I guess for the purpose of studying

308
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,300
because I don't trade on Sundays anymore

309
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:13,279
and because we are in an area where it could go either way 
I have to force myself to go down into LTF to Day-Trade the sessions 
so I'll be looking for inefficiencies\BSL\SSL for DOL and technically not have a bias intraday

317
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,360
it's an ant time frame on email the s p

318
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,980
okay you can see here on Sunday and

319
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,899
Monday of last week we rallied up

320
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,120
straight back down aggressive rally

321
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,240
higher and trade it up into that higher

322
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,300
inefficiency on the weekly chart

323
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,639
weekly volume imbalances what this says

324
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
and then we work lower

325
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
tray back up into a balanced price range

326
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
which is because of this singular up

327
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,300
candle which is a buy side balance

328
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,639
outside efficiency in this city which is

329
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,620
a singular candle cell sign imbalance

330
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,899
bison efficiency

331
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,300
these two areas here makes this a

332
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
balanced price range that's why we had

333
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,720
it rally up

334
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
and aggressively slammed lower

335
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,360
targeting the sell side and trading into

336
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
the Fairbank app here

337
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,800
right there

338
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,279
and then back up into that same balance

339
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,180
price range extend it to the right

340
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,620
boom

341
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,139
Rejects

342
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,440
all of this consolidation here in my

343
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,260
mind I'm thinking this is to

344
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,899
enticing for them and even this over

345
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,480
here is just too enticing for sell side

346
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,100
liquidity rate

347
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,019
so cell solid liquidity here and sell

348
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,959
side liquidity below these lows here 

349
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,060
I would favor a run into that you know in
the first part of the week that's what I would like to see

352
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,000
but

353
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
I am again reminding you that we have

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,740
not yet opened for the new week yet so

355
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,320
Sunday's afternoons where we're at here

356
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,699
at the time of me making this recording

357
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,560
and later in the evening a few hours

358
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,800
from now we will see the opening

359
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,920
of the new week so

360
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
unless we get above this High here I think it wants a probe of lower

362
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,440
sell sign liquidity pools

363
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,779
NASDAQ e mini Futures 15-minute time

364
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,959
frame uh this one here I like the idea

365
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,940
of getting below this low and there's

366
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,740
that little bit of an inefficiency

367
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,240
okay so

368
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,100
um as long as we don't trade

369
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,540
Above This High here

370
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,339
it looks heavy

371
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,880
and I would favor a move to that cell

372
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
site and closing in this inefficiency

373
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,699
right there

374
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,139
it's interesting to see how we had that

375
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,180
little tiny little Fair bag at right

376
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,620
there it went right up into it and then

377
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,139
slammed it lower for the sell side below

378
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,899
here it's rather shallow

379
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,959
and I traded this on Friday

380
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,120
but the uh

381
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,760
the continuation lower is what I'm

382
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,199
interested in

383
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,260
and while I wouldn't be you know

384
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
typically afraid of

385
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,980
it running Above This short-term high

386
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,019
and then collapsing it's better that it

387
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,699
didn't do that because we have already

388
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,620
with the vision time frame we have a

389
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,540
really nice Market structure here

390
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,160
the fact that we went to a short-term

391
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,899
premium there to get into this fair

392
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,440
value Gap and breaker

393
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,899
so I would like to see a gap lower try

394
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,420
to fill a gap and

395
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,100
reach into this area here that's the

396
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,079
scenario I'm looking for for Nasdaq it

397
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,040
doesn't mean I'm going to be right don't

398
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,839
bet the farm on don't even try to take a

399
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,459
trade on it okay just observe it and

400
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,120
watch it I won't be Trading until we get

401
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,180
to Tuesday I want to use Monday's

402
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,699
trading to provide me a better backdrop

403
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,560
or Foundation to what I think the weekly

404
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,420
Candlestick is going to do because as of

405
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,000
right now my mode of thought going

406
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
forward for this particular trading week

407
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,660
is intraday only

408
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,000
no daily bias and that means we have to

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
trade intraday

410
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,899
volatility that means buy side or sell

411
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,759
side liquidity and or trading for

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,280
inefficiencies and that's it so

413
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,240
I know that's probably not which one

414
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,439
here because you just watched me to

415
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,380
deliver a really wonderful month of July

416
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,799
in terms of you know a big run for a

417
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,299
swing Trader model on a daily chart

418
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,619
but they don't set up every day they

419
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,240
don't set up every week and you have to

420
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,679
sit on your hands

421
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,319
and that's what we're counseling you to

422
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,780
do here today is this sit still relax

423
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,360
and let the next setup come to you and

424
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,140
Don't Force It

425
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,100
again as a reminder

426
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,620
this was just a review and I'm just

427
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,880
counseling you

428
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,700
I'm going very very slow with this new

429
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,160
week of trading and allowing Monday to

430
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,620
give me the bias for the week and so

431
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll talk to you next time

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,600
be safe
