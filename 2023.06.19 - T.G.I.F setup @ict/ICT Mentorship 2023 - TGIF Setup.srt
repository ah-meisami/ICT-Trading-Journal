1
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,240
welcome back folks

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
so we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
a concept that's near and dear to me

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,480
it is the TGIF setup or thank God it's

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,619
Friday

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,140
now this is a day-based algorithmic ICT

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,180
trading model and you can use it on all

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,600
assets

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,239
right so as you

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,219
may have already noticed that this is a

11
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,579
day specific model that means the model

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,620
will appear

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,879
one day per week it's on the Friday

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,480
hence the name thank God it's Friday

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,940
and it's a pun on the expression we say here in the states uh TGIF thank God it's Friday

18
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,519
meaning that you survived the work week now you can party and rest on the weekend

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,740
but the pattern and the characteristic
of this pattern is a retracement into
the current weekly range

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,500
and I want to talk a little bit about
the weekly power 3 and the distribution
phase of that

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,780
so let's take a look at the NASDAQ

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,060
Futures Contract this is a one month

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,540
chart

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,220
now obviously you we want to do a

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,140
top-down approach when we're doing our

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,979
analysis and the TGIF trade is going to

33
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,840
be

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,299
extremely precise if you are anchoring

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,460
it against some higher time frame

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,880
premium rate or discount array now

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm describing a premium distribution

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
meaning that the assumption is the

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,759
market has been going up

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,619
and we're going to be looking for some

41
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,659
measure of exhaustion for the weekly

42
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,659
range and then it will pull back into

43
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,299
said weekly range

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,220
as you can see here the monthly chart

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,679
for Nasdaq and for those that are just

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,720
watching this video in the future I'll

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,580
count you to go through and look at the

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,400
dated analysis and commentary

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,220
videos I placed on my YouTube channel

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
that we're focusing on how NASDAQ and

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,080
all the stock index features were called

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,300
higher so you can see here on a monthly

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,680
chart

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,319
right here

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,959
we can see a small little imbalance in

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,120
the form of a fair value Gap cell sign

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,160
of balance bison and efficiency that's

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
defined by these ranges

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,500
extremes which is this month low this

60
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,739
month high this only portion on the

61
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,560
downside or sell side delivery it would

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,500
be requiring buy side delivery so you

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,780
can see buy side being offered here in

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,840
the month of June 2023 so this is a

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,599
premium fair value gap on a monthly

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,540
chart so with these levels in mind let's

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,200
drop down

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,519
okay you can see how on the weekly chart

69
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,280
now you can see the weekly

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
and those respective levels here

71
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,019
from the monthly chart you can see we

72
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,519
did in fact reach up into a monthly

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,379
premium fair value Gap

74
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,860
a high that fair value Gap is here

75
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,420
and the law of the Fair makeup is there

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,340
okay and it's linked

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,400
directly on the monthly chart but then

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,620
dropping down to a weekly chart

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,940
it's going to look like this so it

80
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,019
doesn't look like there's a Fair makeup

81
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:34,920
at all

82
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,739
on the weekly but it is on the monthly

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,420
so we have to do our top down analysis

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,700
in the hierarchy of my premium and

85
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,980
discount arrays will work from higher

86
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,379
time frame down to a lower time frame

87
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,340
so you can see it is Monday

88
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,840
so the last

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,940
week of trading

90
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,280
this is represented by that week here so

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,959
we've started a brand new week so we're

92
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,700
going to ask

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,220
all of you in the audience to disregard

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,080
this little candle just ignore it while

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,159
it's being

96
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,780
shown in the charts because I have no

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,920
way of taking that out okay so you can

98
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,299
see we did reach up into a premium if

99
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,239
everybody got now when it does that it's

100
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,540
very likely to see some measure of

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,940
pullback and you can see as we hit up in

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
the upper end of this premium Fury gap

103
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,900
on the monthly chart but now we're

104
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,699
showing it on weekly

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,820
we went up to it and then came back down

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,680
towards the low end of that range okay

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,620
and that range being again

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,560
that Fairway gap on the monthly chart

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
so let's take a

110
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,780
closer look here and drop down into

111
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,180
that little section of price action and

112
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,979
take a closer look again you can see

113
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,080
zoomed in on the weekly chart

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,320
doesn't appear like there's a fair Vega

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
the market trades just shy

116
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,540
of that hello

117
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220
which would be again the monthly premium

118
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,960
fair value up high or the highest part

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
that makes up everybody got that was

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,900
referencing

121
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,960
the monthly time frame

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,780
there's a small little tiny little

123
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,240
imbalance in here I'm going to reserve

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,979
commentary on that

125
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,860
so just focus on this area right in here

126
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,220
okay and notice how we've had multiple

127
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,039
weeks of NASDAQ going higher I've been

128
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,860
counseling you to anticipate NASDAQ

129
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,539
being the upside leader

130
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,940
across the three averages thou

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,940
s p and NASDAQ NASDAQ being the leader

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,000
issue on the upside and it has performed

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,940
stunning fashion to the upside

134
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,160
outperforming the es and outperforming

135
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,600
the Dao

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,039
but I want you to take a look at how

137
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,780
each one of these weekly candles are

138
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,060
created

139
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,840
true they're all up close candles

140
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,800
but notice where the close is ?
it's above midpoint of the candles entire range
the close is near each candle's High

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,860
this candle here closed near the high

145
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,860
it closed really close to the high

146
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,419
close to the high

147
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,280
close to the high

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,380
and close to the high

149
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,539
so I want to talk a little bit about

150
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,539
my power three concept now

151
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,919
I'm not going to go into great detail

152
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,560
here but I do have lectures on this

153
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,699
YouTube channel

154
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,220
that cover this and it's mentioned in

155
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,199
laced throughout a lot of the teachings

156
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,900
so I'm a firm believer of repetition

157
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,780
makes Mastery you have to see things

158
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,660
over and over again to condition your

159
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,419
mind and your eye to see it you can't

160
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,039
just watch a video and you can't watch a

161
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,720
five minute trainer or condensed version

162
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,060
of what I'm teaching because while you

163
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,740
may feel like you watch the shorter

164
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,280
version of my content by someone else

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,139
that is not teaching you anything except

166
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,419
for the same thing you get with Cliff

167
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,979
Notes okay

168
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,479
it doesn't

169
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,419
compare to the the full detail

170
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,520
so power three

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,699
is not linked to any one particular time

172
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,860
frame but when I first introduced it it

173
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,479
was appropriate at the time

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,240
to teach it on a daily chart okay so

175
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,080
let's look at this with the reference of

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,800
a weekly range the low of the week

177
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,020
where we started trading here to open in

178
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,160
other words this is open high low close

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,039
bar most of

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,919
analysis is done on candlesticks today

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,699
okay I know I have moved away from this

182
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,800
type of chart which is how I used

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,259
my commodity charts and s p charts and

184
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,479
bond charts back in the mid 90s when I

185
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,819
first started Trading and then over the

186
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,800
years my eyes have

187
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
you know unfortunately taking the toll

188
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,099
what looking screens for a long time

189
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,740
it's a lot easier to to read the data

190
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,240
with a Candlestick now

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,020
but from a power three stance

192
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,400
1.the open
2.the decline with the below the opening price 
3.the rally higher making the high of the day 
4.and then the close near the high today 
5.this is po3 
6.where we anticipate the market moving higher on the basis of a weekly analysis higher time frame analysis 

199
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,360
we think that it's

200
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,580
drawing to a premium array something to

201
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,680
make it want to go up here or Draw to it

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,199
and so on Sunday when the Market's open

203
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,960
we anticipate if we're bullish that

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
opening price or this opening price at

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,699
midnight New York local time

206
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,520
you can open drop down we would not see

207
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,399
that as bearish we would anticipate that

208
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,940
so it's the accumulation phase

209
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,979
below the opening price

210
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,599
the manipulation

211
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,480
is the open and then decline but we're

212
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,360
utilizing that function

213
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,060
to accumulate long positions

214
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,240
or for the purpose of studying we would

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
anticipate it opening trading down into

216
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,980
some discount array what would that be a

217
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,680
fair value running short-term sell stops

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,899
on a lower time frame trading down to an

219
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,360
old High

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,339
something that would promote some

221
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,380
discount or quote unquote a support

222
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,680
level

223
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
then the market would displace higher

224
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,800
above the opening price returned it into

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
some kind of

226
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,160
imbalance that would be seen with a

227
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
bullish fair value Gap or a bullish

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,820
breaker

229
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,500
and rally up

230
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,660
so this is the expansion portion of

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,980
power three

232
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,380
and creating the extreme high of the

233
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,399
week

234
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,680
and then trading off that high to close

235
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,779
and this would be the distribution phase

236
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,899
of power three so it's open high low

237
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,279
close

238
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,459
accumulation of Longs at that opening

239
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,920
price and down when it drops below it

240
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,600
this is manipulation this is where

241
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,519
retail Traders would chase that move

242
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,360
lower

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,700
and then they get raked across the coals

244
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,620
as the market goes higher reaching

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,019
towards some higher time frame premium

246
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,420
array some kind of Target okay think of

247
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,760
it like I've outlined here the market

248
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,399
has been drawing each week up into this

249
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,080
area here

250
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,899
well that's each one of these open high

251
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,459
low and close would be represented about

252
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,860
each individual Candlestick here so even

253
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,779
though these are candlesticks

254
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,519
this candle here would be represented by

255
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,339
the open then it traded down then it

256
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,500
rallied up made the high and it came off

257
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,839
the high and close near the high

258
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,040
same

259
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,959
function

260
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,180
but I'm teaching power three with this

261
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,339
open high low close

262
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,820
bar and obviously everything I do is

263
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,100
reversible just whatever I've said in

264
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
previous for when it's bullish you would

265
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,940
just use it when it's bearish it would

266
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,019
open

267
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,880
the accumulation of short positions when

268
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,260
you think the weekly Candlestick is

269
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,120
going to go lower reaching for some kind

270
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,339
of discount array some kind of sell side

271
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,500
decoded something to that effect you

272
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,820
would see the opening price and then

273
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,860
rally up we would see this open as

274
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,120
accumulation of shorts and then

275
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
manipulation higher

276
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,839
tricking retail Traders and thinking

277
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,000
it's going to break out to the outside

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,260
smart money would accumulate short

279
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,660
positions here and then write it down

280
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,060
throughout the week reaching to some

281
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,100
discount array and then before the end

282
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,200
of the week it comes off the low closes

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,920
on Fridays close near but off the low

284
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
so I want you to understand that premise

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839
now this theory of mine is not limited

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,640
to a weekly it's not limited to a daily

287
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,100
chart it's on every time frame

288
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
every single time frame so as long as

289
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,040
you know where the next draw on

290
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,899
liquidity is regardless of what time

291
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,279
frame you're trading what style trading

292
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,100
you're utilizing this idea of

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,480
understanding accumulation manipulation

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
and distribution will serve you well in

295
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,540
terms of finding setups sticking to

296
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,100
institutional order flow in order to

297
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,300
trusting that price is going to continue

298
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,800
moving in your direction if you're on

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,540
side if you're offside it means you're

300
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,980
incorrect about what you think is going

301
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
to happen in the marketplace then you're

302
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,500
obviously going to get stopped out and

303
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,420
that goes without saying but assuming

304
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,820
all things equal

305
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,519
if you're right

306
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,380
you know this is how we interpret price

307
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,740
action

308
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
so I want to take your focus into that

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,579
very range right there that is

310
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:12,120
encapsulated by a down and up Arrow so

311
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,279
this

312
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,100
weekly range here okay we're gonna look

313
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
at that we're gonna zoom in

314
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,839
with this range in mind I want you to

315
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,120
think about how without those levels I

316
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,459
have drawn on the monthly

317
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,200
you can see how if you don't have those

318
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,480
reference points it's kind of hard to

319
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
determine what it would be reaching for

320
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,060
that's why you want to spend majority of

321
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,920
your time on a higher time frame charts

322
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
because the Market's going to gravitate

323
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
towards these higher time frame premium

324
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,740
arrays or discount arrays if it's

325
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,180
drawing towards a premium array that

326
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,040
means that the bias is going to be

327
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,160
primarily bullish each day of that week

328
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,019
or the week to come you would be

329
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,519
anticipating

330
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,680
any decline is to accumulate long

331
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,820
positions

332
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,339
and then distribute those long positions

333
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,380
to a premium array

334
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,040
so that week right there let's zoom in

335
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,740
all right and I'm using the continuous

336
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,839
contract here so that way you can see

337
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,579
the distinctions and

338
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,820
or the similarities right now it is

339
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,360
mid-june

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
2023

341
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
and this is the NASDAQ weekly

342
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
candlestick

343
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,300
so the low of the range isn't marked

344
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,399
here it is not the opening price so the

345
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,440
low of this candle is not the open the

346
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
open is just slightly above the the low

347
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
you can see a small little separation

348
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,320
there and then we have the Run higher

349
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,540
makes the high of the week and then we

350
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,180
close here on the week

351
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,480
TGIF or thank God it's Friday

352
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,959
is a setup that I've codified for end of

353
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,480
week range Concepts I don't want to say

354
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,459
reversal pattern sometimes I have

355
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,920
mistakenly referred to it as a reversal

356
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,779
pattern it is a reversal pattern in the

357
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,220
sense that

358
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,579
in the last portion of

359
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,120
Friday's trading you can if it hasn't

360
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,459
occurred yet you can anticipate some

361
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,200
measure of retracement into the weekly

362
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,760
range and when I say that what do I mean

363
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,459
the lowest low of the week all the way

364
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,320
up to the highest high of the week

365
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,380
that's your weekly range okay now let's

366
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,180
assume for a moment that is two o'clock

367
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,339
in the afternoon New York local time and

368
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,920
you're trading or studying the index

369
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,300
features and it just so happens to be

370
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,760
we're looking at the NASDAQ

371
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,820
I taught that there is a PM session okay

372
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,380
between two o'clock and three o'clock

373
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,899
there is a formation that I dubbed the

374
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,300
ICT Silver Bullet okay I codified that

375
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,440
as well I've already shared an

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,180
introductory lesson on my YouTube

377
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,800
channel I will be teaching more about

378
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
that as we go along and there'll also be

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
some more tips and tricks with it in my

380
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,339
books to come but you'll you won't need

381
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,660
the books I know that sounds like a plug

382
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,880
go by my books when they come out

383
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,920
um the first book will be released when

384
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,660
I get to 1 million subscribers on the

385
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,740
YouTube channel I get a lot of questions

386
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,120
as to when it's going to be released

387
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,220
that's the timeline

388
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,959
and then six months after that the

389
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,160
second then

390
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,100
going in perpetuity until we get to uh

391
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
the final fourth book

392
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,980
so the uh the range for that entire

393
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,980
range of the weekly low and the high

394
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,519
when we assume that there is a high form

395
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,800
for the week okay and we can assume that

396
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,639
is the case when we get to about 130

397
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,680
or so on the Friday

398
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,680
and then we can anticipate some measure

399
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,420
of retracement into the weekly range if

400
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,360
now again this is a major

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
point that needs to be required in the

402
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
analysis if the market has reached some

403
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,699
premium array if it has not reached a

404
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,560
higher time frame premium array

405
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,480
then it could continue into the close

406
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
and close right on the high so that's

407
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,959
how you distinguish whether or not it's

408
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,399
going to form or it's going to keep on

409
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,380
going and closure on the high but

410
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,540
because we traded up into that monthly

411
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,920
fair value Gap

412
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
and because we have been trading up for

413
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,120
a long series of weeks

414
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,160
each week being bullish

415
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
we've maintained a bullish delivery and

416
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
we have been maintaining a bullish

417
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,500
analysis on stock index Futures over the

418
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,720
last few weeks so none of this has taken

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,220
us by surprise

420
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,920
but I want you to think about when you

421
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,139
anticipate a high of the week is

422
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,459
probably in and I'll talk about that

423
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,839
when we get into lower time frames for

424
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,639
the sake of conversation let's assume

425
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,519
for a moment that you had the ability to

426
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,959
determine

427
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,060
that there was a high already formed and

428
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,860
now anything going into the clothes on

429
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,199
Friday of this week

430
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,540
inside this weekly range okay try to

431
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,279
ignore this one here

432
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,279
so I had to take the screenshot of this

433
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
chart and it obviously shows the new

434
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,720
week we're working off of them so this

435
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,300
range here we're not even concerned with

436
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,240
this we're only looking at the high this

437
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,880
candle and the lower that candle in the

438
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,899
respective levels that's being

439
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,000
identified here so the high of the week

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,820
range and the low of the weekly range if

441
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,279
you measure with a Fibonacci

442
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,959
from the lowest low all the way up to

443
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
the high

444
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,220
now you will be doing this intraday

445
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,799
as you approach the afternoon session

446
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,780
doesn't mean that you can't see this

447
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,419
TGIF pattern form in the morning session

448
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,939
it's more likely to form in the

449
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,260
afternoon especially if we had

450
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,939
continuation on the upside in the

451
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,679
morning session then it's more likely to

452
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,699
create

453
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,040
in the afternoon session

454
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
but the Range High in the range low if

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,320
you put a 0.20 and a 0.3

456
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,860
level on your Fibonacci that's basically

457
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,820
giving you the 20 and 30 D marker for

458
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,919
the entire weekly range and that's the

459
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,780
only thing that's being shown here I'm

460
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,840
denoting where 20 of the range from the

461
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
high down to the low 20 percent of that

462
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,160
range is here which will be 15 326.75

463
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,940
and then 30 of that range would be 15

464
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,200
252 and a half

465
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,900
so those two levels here that is your

466
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,500
sweet spot okay that's where TGIF will

467
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,360
likely draw into

468
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,539
there are times when it can draw into

469
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,179
forty percent or more that's

470
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,940
more of a conversation for reversals

471
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,900
or Market tops or bottoms but we're

472
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,059
gonna Reserve that for another time

473
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,320
because it's outside this code with this

474
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,240
discussion

475
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,700
meaning that if we can watch price

476
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,520
delivery on Friday whether it be in the

477
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,840
morning session or the afternoon session

478
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,539
if we get to some level of

479
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,660
a premium Target being reached or as we

480
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,039
saw on the monthly chart we traded up

481
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,840
into that fair Vega the day of the week

482
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,780
is Friday it's been going up every day

483
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,240
so it's

484
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,940
within the realm of reasonable to

485
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,299
anticipate the market drawing back okay

486
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,740
so

487
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,020
the fact that it's dropping down I I

488
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,700
learned I'm sure you've probably heard

489
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,980
this also in books and such and other

490
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,299
Educators it's profit taking and I have

491
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,460
been guilty of using those terms early

492
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,160
on in my career where the market would

493
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,380
be dropping lower and I would assume

494
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,960
that that is profit taking and I don't

495
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,520
believe that is the case and I'm not

496
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,679
going to try to sell that to you it's my

497
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,720
argument and

498
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,240
case that I make that these markets are

499
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,160
algorithmic and everything happens

500
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,100
because it's designed and engineered to

501
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,760
do such so if there was an algorithm and

502
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm going to assume for a moment some of

503
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
you don't believe there is one that's

504
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,860
running the marketplace

505
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,919
then it wouldn't do

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,660
some of these types of things but if

507
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,220
there is an algorithm then it should do

508
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,020
these types of things right that's my

509
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,240
argument I'm not trying to be dogmatic

510
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,700
about it here but I just proposed the

511
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,200
idea so that way you can go into price

512
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
action with that in mind when you're

513
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,780
studying it

514
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,360
so if there was a reasonable means of

515
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,600
measuring or a macro

516
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,080
a short little list of directives that

517
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,620
the algorithm would follow to reprice

518
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,140
from the highest high the week down to

519
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,720
some predetermined

520
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,860
price

521
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,539
what would that be

522
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,799
well we're going to walk through that

523
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,380
here but the bullseye if you have a

524
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,059
little sweet spot that the market can

525
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,460
retrace down into

526
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,320
in other words we don't anticipate it

527
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
closing right on the high so if it's

528
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
going to come off the high before

529
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,360
Friday's close and ending the week of

530
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,480
trading it's going to stop somewhere

531
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
between the 20 and 30 percent range

532
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,460
now right away this is going to sound

533
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,080
like oh here we go we have a Cherry

534
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,299
Picked example but I promise you I have

535
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,179
very very long-term students that have

536
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,120
learned this from me years ago and they

537
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,340
see me do this with the daily ranges

538
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,840
they see me do this with the weekly

539
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,880
ranges and they're able to do it as well

540
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,799
so I'm teaching you the concept and the

541
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,020
building blocks to understanding it but

542
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,520
there's a lot of other things you can do

543
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,020
with this information but this is just

544
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,480
an introductory to the TGIF

545
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,820
set up

546
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,640
so here is that same idea now being

547
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,980
applied to the

548
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,900
and on trading view if you're following

549
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,940
along that that's the teaching medium I

550
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,980
use and pull it off on a Wiki chart you

551
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,780
would see that this range again

552
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,780
disregard this this is the new week

553
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,860
Candlestick so we're not worrying about

554
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,840
that we're talking about last week and

555
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,220
how we could have used this information

556
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,280
on Friday I promise you buttons were

557
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,659
pushed on Friday you're going to see the

558
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,520
execution but I'm teaching you

559
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,559
conceptually what was in my mind how my

560
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,240
students also know about this pattern as

561
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,919
well and how we look for it

562
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
so here's 20 and 30 percent of that

563
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,640
Weekly range from the high

564
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,120
and those levels being shown here 15 3

565
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,380
26 and three quarters and 15 252 and a

566
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,500
half

567
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
all right here's the NASDAQ

568
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
sets our contract daily chart

569
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,480
all right we can see that this

570
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,679
Candlestick here

571
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,360
makes the high of the week

572
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,220
and the high comes in at fifteen

573
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,280
thousand four seventy five and a half

574
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,059
and then we trade down into

575
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,400
the range between 20 and 30 of the

576
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,840
entire weekly range the weekly range

577
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,100
being the high here

578
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,600
and the low here

579
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,400
20 percent

580
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,039
of this entire range here

581
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,320
subtracted from this high

582
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,140
would give us this level right there and

583
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,460
then 20

584
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,700
and 30 respectively would be that TGIF

585
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,159
draw on liquidity okay so think about

586
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,380
like that the market will likely draw

587
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,400
down to 20 or 30 percent of the weekly

588
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
range so that's how we can anticipate

589
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,020
Friday's trading in terms of a intraday

590
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,539
reversal or a weekly retracement I'll

591
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,860
leave it up to you how you want to

592
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,480
classify it okay either one of them

593
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,980
would be considered correct in terms of

594
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,200
describing what it is you're Trading

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,580
Monday's trading here

596
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,940
Tuesday's trading Wednesday Thursday and

597
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,919
then Friday opening making the high of

598
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,679
the week and then trading down and

599
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,900
closing inside

600
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,299
that 20 and 30 percent of the total

601
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,419
weekly range that is a successful

602
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,940
TGIF trade

603
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
now let's go into the details with this

604
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,340
a little bit more

605
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,860
right here is an hourly chart okay you

606
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,799
can see how again we have a short-term

607
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,700
High

608
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,559
we rallied up

609
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,539
don't look at this as support because we

610
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,400
don't know what the high is yet so I'm

611
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,780
just showing you these are the levels

612
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,960
that once the high is in place and we

613
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,940
can anticipate forming in the lunch hour

614
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,679
or just before lunch

615
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,380
around 1 30 going into two o'clock

616
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,440
the assumption is that we're likely to

617
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
draw down into 20 or 30 percent of the

618
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,900
weekly range if we've been bullish and

619
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,400
we've been bullish for a while and we

620
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
hit our higher time frame premium arrays

621
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,020
and targets so it's reasonable for it to

622
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,880
draw back if it's going to draw back

623
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,500
it's going to do so in a controlled

624
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,480
manner because the market is

625
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,059
algorithmically delivered so price is

626
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,340
controlled it's filing a script so

627
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,200
therefore where can we anticipate the

628
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,659
market to draw down to if a retracement

629
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,880
is in fact what's going to come in

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,400
before Friday's close

631
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
we have to Define where the weekly high

632
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,400
is the low is obviously here it formed

633
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,880
on Sunday so Sunday at 6 PM we're seeing

634
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,440
that Candlestick here represent that

635
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,600
Weekly range low

636
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,919
and then we can see Friday

637
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,520
all that range in here the highest high

638
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,679
we anticipate that high for me Friday

639
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,520
morning to Friday's lunch or

640
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,880
certainly between 1 30 and 2 o'clock why

641
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,240
because it's likely to retrace into the

642
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,140
close

643
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,100
now in terms of keeping things easier

644
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,620
for some of you that are

645
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,600
I guess familiar with trading in some of

646
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,720
the terms that are used unfortunately

647
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,179
incorrectly they'll say profit taking is

648
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,279
coming in and the market will retrace

649
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,480
lower

650
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,940
and it's not an absence of buyers and

651
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,980
it's not the sellers overtaking buyers

652
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,500
it's absolutely controlled

653
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,840
the market will just simply gravitate

654
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,760
towards 20 25 30 and sometimes if it

655
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,820
goes behind Beyond 30 percent that could

656
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,400
indicate an all-out reversal on a

657
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,740
long-term basis I don't suggest that's

658
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,440
the case here today because today is a

659
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,039
holiday and we've only had a short span

660
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,679
of time trading where on a holiday we

661
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,059
only have like until one o'clock in the

662
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,159
afternoon or so the Futures are trading

663
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,480
so

664
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,640
I don't suspect that we've created the

665
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,279
high yet that could obviously

666
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,380
you know be different when we open up

667
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,799
later on this evening to start a full

668
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,200
normal session to start our normal week

669
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,440
so that's our weekly range viewed over

670
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,900
the scope of a hourly chart

671
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,240
okay so we're going to get into this and

672
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,940
get a little more detailed

673
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,860
dropping down inside that range and

674
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,380
zooming in towards the high end of it

675
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,260
this is the 15 minute Candlestick chart

676
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,020
so 15 minutes

677
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,279
we can see that the high forms in here

678
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,779
around the nine o'clock in the morning

679
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:46,679
hour

680
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,860
on Friday it rallies up

681
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,240
creating what

682
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,980
a Juda swing

683
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,440
so all this initial run here sucks

684
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,940
Traders into thinking it's going to go

685
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,460
higher it's been going higher don't

686
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,740
fight the trend don't fight the FED

687
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,840
don't try to do this don't try to do

688
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
that everybody has an opinion about what

689
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,140
they should or shouldn't do

690
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,600
but if they don't have the Rules of

691
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,340
Engagement that the algorithm is

692
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,720
employing

693
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,340
all of the ideas or the the Dogma that

694
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,380
every Trader has and subscribes to as a

695
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,580
religion whether you want to believe it

696
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,919
or not your trading system is a religion

697
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,480
you have faith in it you're investing in

698
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,179
it you're paying tithes to it so the

699
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,480
bottom line is all this

700
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,059
deciding of taking on risk

701
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,860
it's going to have to be rooted on

702
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,539
something that makes sense

703
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,340
and I don't believe that buying and

704
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,159
selling pressure is the sense behind why

705
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,840
prices going up and down it's 100

706
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,159
controlled

707
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,860
so if we can see that initial surge at

708
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,100
the open on Friday as we see here

709
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,340
the market runs up creates this tendency

710
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,539
to want to

711
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,179
expect to keep going higher

712
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,880
an old highest broken here

713
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,700
but I teach that is by side liquidity so

714
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
the market goes higher they're running

715
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,059
out these relative equal highs because

716
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,919
those pending orders that would be used

717
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,900
for Traders that trade on a breakout

718
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,600
they want to buy strength

719
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,820
smart money employs that as their

720
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,460
counterparty to going short

721
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,140
and they're going to trade with this in

722
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,179
mind 20 to 30 percent of the weekly

723
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,980
range

724
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,679
TGIF Thank God It's Friday there is a

725
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,020
systematic approach to trading these

726
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,900
types of days on a Friday where it

727
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,700
trades back to 20 to 30 percent of the

728
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,200
range what does it look like well

729
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,720
everything I've already taught you

730
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,539
but the premise is is why and when it

731
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,100
will reach for

732
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,279
that 20 to 30 range of the weekly

733
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,900
highest high in the lowest low of the

734
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,279
week

735
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,760
look what we see here 50 minute

736
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,860
last up close candle prior to this move

737
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,779
lower this displacement here the change

738
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,220
in the state delivery is the opening

739
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,860
price that is my ICT order block okay it

740
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
has nothing to do

741
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,120
with an Fu candle okay you see all these

742
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,740
people trying to add things to it or

743
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,720
change the name of it there is no Fu

744
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,419
candle okay it's not an engulfing candle

745
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,679
it has nothing to do with any of that

746
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,140
the fact that the market is likely to

747
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,179
create the high here see I already know

748
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,220
I already know that this is going to

749
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,260
form because of that fair value gap on

750
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,320
the multi-chart we traded up into it

751
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,020
and now I'm talking very uh assertively

752
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,460
aren't I

753
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,760
I brought receipts today I promise

754
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,679
the up close candle is what we're

755
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,520
measuring whether you want to have the

756
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,559
wherewithal that goes short up in here

757
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,440
or not you don't need to you want to

758
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,380
wait for it to displace

759
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,059
one big candle up

760
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,880
and then it runs right over top of it

761
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,820
that opening price is where the change

762
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,220
in the state of delivery is made when it

763
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,640
goes back through it which is right here

764
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,000
then we have a short-term low taken

765
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,559
with this candle

766
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,779
and it closes and creates in the candle

767
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,340
here and then as soon as this candle

768
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,080
starts trading we have what

769
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
that's your 2022 model

770
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,100
so no matter how you slice it okay

771
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,440
I have so many people that will come to

772
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,299
my Channel or they'll talk about they'll

773
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,120
commentate around my content they'll

774
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,100
either be supportive of it or they'll

775
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,500
try to take shots at it and say I don't

776
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,760
like them because he has this he talks

777
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,919
too much he doesn't really have this or

778
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,960
that I have a lot of things

779
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,480
and it's imperative you go through all

780
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,220
of it because you're going to see how

781
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,919
all that fits together

782
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,539
the TGIF is a strategy that you

783
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,100
anticipate price delivering to in other

784
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,539
words it's a draw on liquidity that's

785
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,240
all it is and it happens on a Friday

786
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,059
and it reverses whatever has happened on

787
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,100
the weekly range it's going to go back

788
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,740
into 20 to 30 of whatever that Weekly

789
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,140
range has done is that complicated folks

790
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,000
does that sound complicated because it's

791
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,460
not it's really easy but how do you

792
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,080
trade it how do you go in and implement

793
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,059
it take it and go out there and study it

794
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,260
you go through the process of everything

795
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,179
I've already taught you you could trade

796
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,279
the Turtle suit which is the run here

797
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,500
above the buy stock so when the buy

798
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,059
side's taken you can sell short right

799
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,279
there that's a very very difficult thing

800
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,140
to do for New Traders

801
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,240
you have to really trust you know what

802
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,220
you're doing

803
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,659
you don't need to be able to do that

804
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,179
wait for it to give you your 2022 model

805
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,039
here's your favorite you got with the

806
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,539
short term shift in Market structure

807
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,620
here or if you want to use that one

808
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,200
either one it validates it then it

809
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,120
trades up into what

810
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,220
the 2022 entry model so it's trading

811
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,380
in this little area and because we have

812
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,480
to Traverse over lunch that's why we

813
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,140
have multiple passes

814
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,779
during the lunch hour

815
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,000
nothing has changed

816
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,260
treat this candle in this candle and the

817
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,820
highest one that trades into it which is

818
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,080
this one here

819
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,240
until we take out the low

820
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,640
here as long as you don't take out this

821
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,679
High all of these candles in between are

822
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
all time distortion

823
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,399
the range is already defined

824
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,760
2022 model

825
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,919
I teach more about time Distortion in my

826
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
books by the way I'm not going to teach

827
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,340
it on the YouTube channel I'm not going

828
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,960
to teach you on Twitter because

829
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,779
some of the things that I teach

830
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,159
you know

831
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,659
there's people out there already taking

832
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,820
my content and trying to write books and

833
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,200
get ahead of me and they're writing them

834
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,820
incompletely they don't they don't know

835
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,080
the details that my books are going to

836
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,720
have so this is a money grab for them

837
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,539
I don't want anybody looking at me as a

838
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,360
cash cow because of my ability to teach

839
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,919
this well and other people that learn

840
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,020
from me are making lots of money now

841
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,860
I want you to learn it properly but

842
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,039
you aren't going to learn it just by one

843
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,440
covering of it okay whether it be on me

844
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,419
or someone else no one's going to teach

845
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,399
it better than me because you know I

846
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,740
authored it I codified these Concepts

847
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,320
you're only being introduced to them

848
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,360
and don't fall victim thinking you're

849
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,500
going to hear somebody tell you in an

850
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
abbreviated format this is how you do

851
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,100
this is how you do that

852
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,980
but I want you to see how all the things

853
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,159
that I teach you can find them

854
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,679
throughout larger fractals and price

855
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,720
action that means

856
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,299
there's more than one way to skin a cat

857
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,100
with my Concepts just like there's other

858
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,480
ways that people can trade and they can

859
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,799
find theirselves and it's fun it's

860
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,260
wonderful but with my Concepts you don't

861
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,059
have to be a one-trick pony

862
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,120
there is not one PD array not one model

863
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,880
that is superior to the next

864
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,919
it's whatever one that you feel

865
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,480
comfortable with the one that makes the

866
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
most sense to you okay so

867
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,460
obviously we see how we moved from this

868
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,840
area here

869
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,399
this fair value Gap in the form of

870
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,320
Mississippi it's outside and bounce bios

871
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,059
efficiency so this move down here

872
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,059
separated by this candle's low and this

873
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,440
candle is high

874
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,120
all the sell side needs to be what

875
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,080
it needs to be delivered with buy side

876
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,820
we see that here

877
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,440
but look how many times it's doing it

878
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,699
why is it doing it that many times

879
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,739
because it has to Traverse through the

880
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,940
lunch hour

881
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,760
the lunch hour there's a macro that runs

882
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,800
within lunch hour and it usually runs

883
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
what the stops so where would the stops

884
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,540
be

885
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,399
right about this High we see it run

886
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,500
there and we return back to here but

887
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,899
there's no necessity to get above it it

888
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,580
says respecting with these little

889
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,020
Mohawks these little tiny little

890
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,020
deviations outside of the range that

891
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,839
creates my fair value Gap this low so it

892
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,580
goes above it here a little bit a little

893
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,219
bit here we expect that we anticipate

894
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,899
that type of thing it does not undermine

895
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:49,080
the the overall scenario

896
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,320
then you watch price melt into the 20 to

897
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,359
30 of the range before Fridays close

898
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,599
that would be the shade area here

899
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,640
zooming in here again you can see this

900
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,760
is the 15 minute order block

901
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,260
and we're trading up into that shaded

902
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,540
area that was found and defined on the

903
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,580
hourly chart you can see we have that

904
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,560
run on the stops here

905
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,839
then we drop down take out sell side and

906
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,339
then one more time rallies back up to

907
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:15,839
the 15 minute bear shorter block so this

908
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,859
is a reclaimed bearish order block

909
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,900
sell sides below here

910
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,040
the market drops

911
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,839
here's the model 2022 again

912
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,660
short term low

913
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,040
drop everybody you got rally up if you

914
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,960
don't get that entry

915
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
okay because before two o'clock and you

916
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,880
have a rigid rule set now that you're

917
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,260
going to be algorithmic behind every

918
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,540
trading idea that you employ whether it

919
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,640
be paper trading studying or live

920
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,260
Trading

921
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,900
you're going to stay Within These sweet

922
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,700
spots in terms of time I've already

923
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,900
talked between two o'clock and four

924
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,480
o'clock uh the afternoon PM session you

925
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,839
can finally trade a price run that will

926
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,220
seek liquidity

927
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,619
it's Friday the market has shown a

928
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,839
willingness to do what give a Judas

929
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,880
swing in the morning we're seeing that

930
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,859
here this is a Judah swing then it

931
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,660
overlaps all that so it's a change in

932
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,740
the state of delivery here that's your

933
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,960
bare shorter block we have a model 22

934
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,079
one hour Fairway Gap in the form of a

935
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,020
city that's the Shaded box here and then

936
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,839
we hit the bearish 15 minute order block

937
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,640
again

938
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
it drops creates a fair value you got

939
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,680
it's also a breaker high low higher high

940
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,680
how many models have I shown you already

941
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,800
which one would you have taken

942
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,480
that's the part that makes this

943
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,820
complicated I don't make it complicated

944
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,140
I don't complicate it am I detailed yes

945
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,720
but notice that if one of these patterns

946
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,000
and whatever it is premium array that

947
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,280
you're gonna identify as yours

948
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,460
you already see that the one that you

949
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,400
like you would be utilizing that

950
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
and the other ones aren't

951
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,660
so important to you

952
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,280
so you're able to see what I'm talking

953
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
about and find what it is that meets

954
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,960
your model

955
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm not trying to press you into a mold

956
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,760
where you only do this entry technique

957
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,280
you don't only do whatever I point to

958
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,560
you find your own model using my

959
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,320
Concepts and there's no better way than

960
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,300
another don't look at okay well if I

961
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,460
sold up here it would be more money than

962
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,380
entering on the fear of a gap here

963
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,320
or trading into the breaker here you may

964
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,640
not have recognized this as a fair Vegas

965
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,740
but you can see this high low higher

966
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,720
high the down closed candle here extend

967
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
it through and it's trading onto it here

968
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,640
and here

969
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,579
that's a bearish breaker

970
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:48,660
now other students here would see okay I

971
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,599
see the run-on stops

972
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,300
it breaks lower here's a breaker it

973
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,740
trades up I would trade that as a

974
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,000
breaker

975
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,760
another student may see there's a

976
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,380
breaker there there's a fair value Gap

977
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,000
here I'm going to split that up into

978
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,339
four gradients and I want to take my

979
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,500
entry in the lower portion of that and

980
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,420
lower half of it and we have a fair

981
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,339
value Gap here so I can trade into that

982
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,460
and 25 of this range from the high and

983
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,280
the low that one hour Fairway Gap or

984
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,420
sibi

985
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,760
that's what this area is here you'd be

986
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,520
trading off that gradient again how many

987
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,320
models have I shown you here just in

988
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,339
this

989
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,339
it's not a one hit wonder

990
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,680
the premise is that there's a high

991
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,480
forming when it's been bullish all week

992
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,680
long

993
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,240
and we're going to trade off that high

994
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,520
down into 20 to 30 percent of the range

995
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,119
that's all TGIF is TGIF is not finding

996
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,060
the right PD array in the move I'm

997
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,640
giving you that freedom to pick which

998
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,560
one you're going to use

999
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,020
now watch what happens if you've seen

1000
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,940
all this stuff in hindsight while the

1001
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,380
Market's trading right around here and

1002
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,520
you missed it it's already traded

1003
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,960
outside of

1004
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,640
the fair Vegas

1005
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,160
you missed it what can you do well has

1006
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,200
it traded to the 20 yet after leaving

1007
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,700
the fair value Gap up here I mean it

1008
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,140
hits it here yes

1009
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,240
but we still have time it's still a

1010
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,380
little bit after 11 o'clock in the

1011
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,480
morning on Friday we still have the

1012
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
whole afternoon and lunch session is

1013
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,780
still go through

1014
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,240
so what does lunch usually do it runs

1015
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,099
stops

1016
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,260
so we're expecting and anticipating a

1017
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,780
rally up to clear the board of any

1018
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,240
trailed buy stops

1019
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,040
does it sweep that high no it doesn't

1020
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,060
need to

1021
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,000
but it will run rejection blocks now in

1022
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,240
your notes rejection blocks are the same
function as running out liquidity

1024
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,300
what's the highest up close

1025
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,760
this one here prior to this High here is

1026
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,660
it here

1027
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,980
no

1028
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,240
there

1029
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,579
extend that through in time you can see

1030
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,980
we sweep that it does not require it to

1031
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,960
go above this High we're trading inside

1032
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,160
this Wick which is what a gap

1033
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,619
so because we've seen it create a little

1034
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,900
Mohawk outside the

1035
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,520
one hour

1036
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,960
very bad you got

1037
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,900
it's also defined on that one hour bare

1038
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,060
shorter block the opening price

1039
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,280
so we anticipate that little movement

1040
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,680
outside of that it's reasonable we don't

1041
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,780
want to see it but if it happens we're

1042
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,280
not freaking out

1043
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,020
so since we created this little

1044
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,200
deviation outside that guy

1045
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,380
returning back to it is permissible

1046
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,140
notice where the bodies are inside of

1047
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,020
that one hour fair value Gap

1048
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,440
the Wicks do the damage so how do you

1049
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,940
cut through all this stuff if we already

1050
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,060
anticipated a run in permitting a mohawk

1051
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,380
a little tiny little coloring Outside

1052
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,000
the Lines if you will

1053
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,980
we have to look in here where is the

1054
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,079
rejection block think about your pdra

1055
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,180
Matrix I've taught you in core content

1056
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,320
month four

1057
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,440
on this YouTube channel

1058
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,420
there's your highest up close that's

1059
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,099
your rejection block extend it to the

1060
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,020
right and as you see what we're doing

1061
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,660
we're wiping that out it does not need

1062
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,540
to take out the wiki rejection blocks

1063
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,420
are a very instrumental part for me

1064
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,480
utilizing time Distortion and I promise

1065
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,220
you I'll give you more details but it

1066
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,380
requires a lot of other things for you

1067
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,660
to take anything away from it don't

1068
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,160
listen to anybody out there doing time

1069
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,540
Distortion lectures because they

1070
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,800
absolutely have no idea what they're

1071
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,980
talking about I promise you

1072
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,420
so getting back into this Fairbank app

1073
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,359
here if you want to utilize the TGIF and

1074
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,920
you anticipate it drawing down into 20

1075
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,040
to 30 of the range of the weekly

1076
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,900
expansion that you've been witness of

1077
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,180
whatever that week would be any future

1078
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,339
week you can utilize this information

1079
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,820
okay

1080
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,440
you missed the ideal entry inside the

1081
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,640
Fairway gun

1082
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,680
it moves outside of it

1083
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,500
can you participate

1084
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,220
sure you can

1085
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,820
we're dropping down into a one minute

1086
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,740
chart here is that fair value Gap that

1087
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,119
was on the five minute chart

1088
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,480
until we hit it here at the low end of

1089
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,820
the one hour Fairway you got that's the

1090
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,920
Shaded area here

1091
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,099
and now we ring into two o'clock

1092
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,079
time period which is this bullish candle

1093
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,839
right there that's two o'clock on Friday

1094
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,480
and then we drop down

1095
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
so what did I teach you about two

1096
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,880
o'clock to three o'clock in the

1097
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,040
afternoon on index features

1098
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,400
my ICT Silver Bullet well here is the

1099
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,240
ICT Silver Bullet we have a high low

1100
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,020
higher high reacting off of an hourly

1101
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,400
bearish

1102
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,520
Fairway Gap in the form of a city

1103
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,980
we have a fairway Gap here so is order

1104
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,920
flow bearish it sure is it's respecting

1105
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,140
every premium array small little Fairway

1106
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,020
Gap here goes into it rebalance

1107
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,760
and the bottom end

1108
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,099
of the hourly fair value Gap

1109
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,839
we would anticipate

1110
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,660
displacement lowered boom does it happen

1111
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,119
yes it does

1112
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,859
breaker fair value got trade up into it

1113
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,780
get short

1114
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,640
reach into

1115
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,780
30 to 20 how far can it go well you have

1116
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,180
to wait on time

1117
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,839
TGIF you submit the time so I'll show

1118
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,200
you this is the the two o'clock P.M

1119
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,180
ending so it's three o'clock so two to

1120
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,480
three that one hour interval right there

1121
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,579
there's your fair bag Gap that forms the

1122
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,040
ICT Silver Bullet how many models have I

1123
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,500
shown you just in this lecture how many

1124
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,839
opportunities to get in

1125
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,359
multiple

1126
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,420
another one right here

1127
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,240
it's still inside the Silver Bullet time

1128
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,579
frame so if you missed this one you

1129
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,800
could have done this one

1130
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,660
put it but it hits the 20 Michael

1131
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,400
wouldn't that be the end of it no

1132
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,920
there's still time time ends with this

1133
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,440
shaded area here at the close

1134
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,359
okay four o'clock when that Bell Rings

1135
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,180
you see it on CNBC ding ding ding

1136
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,500
everybody claps their hands like they

1137
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,540
did something special

1138
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,780
all this time you're gonna submit to it

1139
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,780
and as we get into the last hour trading

1140
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,000
three o'clock to four yes I understand

1141
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,700
that trades till five o'clock but the

1142
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,579
bulk of trading ends at four o'clock

1143
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,859
unless earnings season comes in and does

1144
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,240
something after the bill but the point

1145
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,000
is the majority of the trading is done

1146
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,740
before four o'clock

1147
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,260
in New York local time

1148
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,960
so the entries must be taken between two

1149
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,460
o'clock and three o'clock for a silver

1150
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,560
bullet okay so I'm adding all that extra

1151
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,700
value into this lesson

1152
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,520
here is a one minute chart zoomed in

1153
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,619
here's that favorite you got

1154
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,700
inside of the hourly Fairway Gap City

1155
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,260
and where it bumped the bottom of it and

1156
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,940
it reacted during the two o'clock hour

1157
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,440
created the fair value got with the

1158
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,560
breaker high low higher high reaction

1159
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,420
we're seeing this is a signature saying

1160
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,359
that yes order flow is bearish yes the

1161
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,220
algorithm is driving price down towards

1162
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,099
the 20 25 and 30 percent of the weekly

1163
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,680
range that's where we'd anticipate it it

1164
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,079
gives you a fair value Gap I'm getting

1165
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,640
short here 15 contracts at 15 357 even I

1166
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,579
want to be ahead of that candles High I

1167
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,980
want to make sure I'm getting filled

1168
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,079
that was my entry

1169
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,380
I'm holding to see if we get into the

1170
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,680
last hour of trading how we trade we

1171
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,720
trade into three o'clock

1172
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,760
we trade half of

1173
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,760
the 30 and 20 so 25 of the weekly range

1174
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,319
has been traded to here

1175
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,300
small little retracement and then I'm

1176
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,960
anticipating another Drive Lower

1177
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm not trying to buy it

1178
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,920
I want to see does it take out that load

1179
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,619
it's formed in the last hour trading

1180
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,040
here is sell side my limit order was

1181
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,079
placed right there

1182
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,900
as it went down into it boom

1183
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,940
I missed all this movement here that's

1184
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,560
fine 20 handlers or so

1185
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,079
then off the low of the day enclosed

1186
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,480
way away from where my cover was so

1187
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,859
15 357 even short on 15 covering at 15

1188
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,599
280 even

1189
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,099
full pool no partials

1190
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,000
that's what it looks like folks

1191
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,920
TGIF thank God it's Friday

1192
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,280
the pattern or setup is simply using 20

1193
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,859
to 30 of the weekly range as the draw on

1194
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,460
liquidity on a Friday okay on a Friday

1195
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,940
if there was no Judah swing at 9 30 when

1196
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,440
the market opened up on Friday and

1197
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,480
rallied higher if it wouldn't have

1198
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,980
formed that in other words if it would

1199
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,420
have just kept climbing higher and

1200
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,540
didn't reverse then I would anticipate a

1201
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,420
lunch time or going into 1 30 to 2

1202
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,380
o'clock

1203
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,020
then create the high of the week so for

1204
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,099
some of you are thinking well how did

1205
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,540
you know how did you know or how would

1206
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,980
you know

1207
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,260
one of those two scenarios are going to

1208
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,940
happen you're going to create the Judah

1209
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,060
swing at the open on Friday at 9 30. if

1210
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,500
you're bearish you're anticipating it to

1211
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,359
pull down into 20 30 of the weekly range

1212
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,440
because the weekly range has been going

1213
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,760
up right

1214
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,339
well for this week it has or last week

1215
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,859
rather and then we would expect it to

1216
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,200
create a false run at the open lore

1217
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,300
Traders into trying to buy it

1218
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,460
and then get trapped near the high and

1219
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,920
they drag it lower into 20 to 30 of the

1220
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,400
weekly range

1221
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,660
look how close we got to 30 of the

1222
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,640
weekly range right there isn't that

1223
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,260
crazy

1224
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,940
now

1225
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,460
you can have static rules where you can

1226
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,760
take this 20 to 30 percent of the range

1227
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,099
of the weekly range and you can do

1228
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,440
gradients on that again you can take it

1229
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,280
this is the low the lower 25 percent

1230
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,240
half of it the upper 25 or 700 in the

1231
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,880
range that makes up the 20 to 30 range

1232
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,060
you can take a partial as it touches 20.

1233
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,160
take another partial at the upper

1234
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,020
portion or upper gradient level before

1235
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,200
50 if it gets to 50 take most of your

1236
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,520
trade off

1237
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,740
then roll your stock to the most recent

1238
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,000
swing High

1239
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,920
and see if it can reach to your next

1240
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,780
gradient level and it would have done so

1241
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,359
here I just elected to wait to see what

1242
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,460
this load was that formed in the last

1243
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,819
hour this one here had already moved

1244
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,700
here so I want to in this retracement I

1245
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,980
was comfortable with anticipating it

1246
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,560
ripping lower to take that one out and

1247
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,020
it did and I did not require to trade to

1248
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,579
30 percent

1249
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,680
so what I was using using is just simply

1250
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,780
the load it Formed here

1251
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,579
allowing traders to think that the low

1252
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,740
was formed and they go in they think

1253
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,839
they have the

1254
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,380
you know the 345 350 algorithm that's

1255
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,680
not an algorithm there's a macro that

1256
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,839
runs and when you don't know what it is

1257
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,140
you won't see what this is doing here

1258
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,780
all this was doing was pulling up

1259
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,760
against

1260
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,280
short-term buy stock buy sides relative

1261
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,619
equal highs here so I knew it was likely

1262
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,079
to go up there but stay inside what

1263
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,800
range 20 to 30. so relative equal highs

1264
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,420
I was comfortable holding that that's

1265
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,740
reasonable for it to go up there and hit

1266
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,839
that then it broke lower attacking the

1267
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,880
sell side so all the people that try to

1268
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,140
buy long

1269
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,640
in here thinking you're going to catch a

1270
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,020
little bit of a move going into the four

1271
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,040
o'clock hour

1272
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,260
they have no idea what they're doing and

1273
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,180
you can see that there's a distinct

1274
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,740
difference between what you think you

1275
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,640
see

1276
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,099
in other YouTube lessons from other

1277
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,099
people versus what I'm showing you here

1278
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:47,040
I promise you if you study this go back

1279
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,500
through every single weekly candle on

1280
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,640
any Market

1281
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,319
you will see this

1282
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,599
you'll see a multitude of potential

1283
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:56,520
entry patterns using what I've taught

1284
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,380
also on this channel

1285
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,680
you only need one you need one entry

1286
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,380
model if you want to get really nuts

1287
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,819
about it you can have every single one

1288
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:08,339
of them understood but none of you know

1289
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,560
how to do that yet okay I promise you if

1290
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,940
they did if anybody's out there on

1291
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,960
YouTube saying they can do it they know

1292
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,460
like the back of their hand now they

1293
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,839
know everything I've taught they would

1294
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,940
be out here executing like I'm doing

1295
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,040
I'm showing you evidence and proof that

1296
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,260
these things are the reasons why I'm

1297
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,460
getting in

1298
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,920
where I'm holding what I'm entering and

1299
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,800
what the logic was

1300
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,500

1301
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,180
don't they're just familiar with it okay
