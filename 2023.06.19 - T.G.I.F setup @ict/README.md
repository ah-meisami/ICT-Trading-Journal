TGIF TRADING MODELðŸ“ˆ

TGIF is a day-specific model designed to exploit end-of-week range across all asset types.


2/ With this trading model we are going to anticipate on the exhaustion of the expansion that took place during the current weekly range. The setup is tied to the Premium and Discount array and it indicates a retracement into the current weekly range.

3/ We have a higher chance that the TGIF Trading Model is going to play out during the NY PM Session.

4/ Analyzing from a top-down approach, start with the High Time Frame (HTF) and then delve into the Low Time Frame (LTF) to understand the asset's movement context.

5/ For bullish candles, ensure the candle's close is near the high (and vice versa for bearish cases). Consider the fundamentals of PO3. TGIF works when a weekly/monthly Drawn on Liquidity (DOL) has already been achieved.

6/ The day's high is typically anticipated between Friday morning and lunchtime. Since most trading occurs before 4 PM New York time, aim to enter positions between 2 PM and 3 PM for optimal results.

7/ Utilize a Fibonacci tool to measure from the week's lowest low to the highest high in bullish scenarios (and vice versa for bearish cases). Look for retracements around 20-30%, occasionally extending up to 40%.

8/ A successful TGIF Movement is indicated when the weekly candle's closing price falls within the 20-30% range of the total weekly range.

9/ To identify entry points, utilize the 2022 ICT Mentorship Model, Silver Bullet, or any other ICT entry model. Begin by looking for a Judas Swing in the morning, and then monitor the change in the state of delivery (BOS) on the M5 or M15 timeframe.


10/ Preferably, make your entry during the PM Session. TGIF Model enables you to anticipate price delivery, with retracement acting as a liquidity draw. When the weekly target price is hit, a reversal occurs on Friday, causing the price to retrace into 20-30% of the week's range.


11/ That was it for the thread!
