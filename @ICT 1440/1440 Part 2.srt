1
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,180
focus it's a lot of things that we look

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,520
at on the charts a lot of things that

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,150
are promoted by educators and authors

4
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,050
gurus and mentors but what specifically

5
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,010
should you be focusing on

6
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,260
the last video I gave you an outline to

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,940
work with in terms of filling in your

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,280
complete Monday through Sunday week in

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,579
15-minute increments so every block on

10
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,850
this grid here represents one 15-minute

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,619
time frame hopefully you've done that

12
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,970
and you've seen just about how much

13
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,340
wasted time you put into other things

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,080
that aren't most likely going to do

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,750
anything for you into power Minh or

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,080
enrichment or just to improve so we're

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,340
gonna focus primarily on taking this

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,270
work week and focusing in on specific

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,100
times in a day and what is it you're

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,780
supposed to be focusing on and studying

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,950
as a forex trader I try to promote the

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,640
idea thinking of the 24 hour day in

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,380
these four incremental cycles there's an

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,819
London session which comprises of the

25
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,560
European and London open which is what I

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,690
refer to as the ICT learning up and kill

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,920
zone it typically includes Frankfurt and

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,370
all the way into the London lunch New

29
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,410
York open or as I refer to it as the New

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,890
York open kill zone the London closed

31
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,349
Asia or I refer to it as the Asian kills

32
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:38,459
them no matter what you do / repression

33
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,270
or a job or whatever it is you're gonna

34
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,750
have to find something in these four

35
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,160
specific times of the day to focus on

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,930
another problem I've seen over the years

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,680
as an educator is my students typically

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,230
want to go in and do everything they

39
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,490
want to be the master of the London

40
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,020
session they want to be a master of the

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,240
New York session they want to trade that

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,250
London clothes and they want to trade

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,890
Asia as well because more is better

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,430
right

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,670
well it's not in fact as a speculator

46
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,910
the less you can do the better because

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,500
less is more when it comes to

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,550
speculation the common misnomer is if

49
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,530
you look at the opportunities throughout

50
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,040
the day even if you understand the time

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,560
windows that's created by liquidity as

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,800
shown here you can quickly talk yourself

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,360
into doing a lot more than what's

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,960
necessary and you become an action hound

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,840
i fallen victim to this when I first

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,210
started trading Forex it was a rather

57
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,510
busy time for foreign exchange so that

58
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,960
ranges were you know pretty large so it

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,030
made me feel like I could do a lot more

60
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,020
and I abandoned what I knew in the

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,880
futures market which is basically the

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,230
same thing that goes on in the Forex

63
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,960
well back then we had open outcry only

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,310
and then when everything went to

65
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,470
electronic trading then everything was

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,060
pretty much what we see in terms of my

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,930
ICT Forex content but a lot of the roles

68
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,120
that I used with trading currency

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,769
futures were applicable to Forex the

70
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,488
overnight trading I wasn't as refined as

71
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,070
I am today because I focus primarily on

72
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,110
the opening of the open outcry pits for

73
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,880
the currency markets as the futures

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,320
exchange is opened so you're going to

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,550
have to get to the decision point for

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,930
yourself as to which one you're going to

77
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,500
focus on now you may be a student and

78
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,740
you have not found your way into your

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,140
career yet okay or your temporary career

80
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,970
you're going to be a full-time trader

81
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,450
eventually and whatever you're doing now

82
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,030
is a student that made transition into

83
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,910
something else based on your employment

84
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,230
after you get out of school

85
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,110
okay Worf has a break in your your

86
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,180
schooling you'd be like a summer break

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,730
or whatever your opportunities will

88
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,820
probably be more open to other times of

89
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,300
the day I

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,980
we recommend you try to pick just one

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,070
okay and the one that you should pick is

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,900
the one that's the most comfortable for

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,050
your family life and your job you do not

94
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,640
want to make things harder for yourself

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,220
by picking a time of day to trade or

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,020
study that's going to be conflicting

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,470
with your personal and work life there's

98
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,840
a balance that has to be made and I can

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,320
tell you for the last 20 plus years it's

100
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,200
been a struggle sometimes for me to

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,440
balance five kids a wife two dogs my own

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,720
personal wants and desires that do what

103
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,100
I want to do with my friends and my

104
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,550
personal time so you have to use that

105
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,620
grid to make a schedule for your family

106
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,020
time if you have a job obviously you

107
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,120
have to schedule that but outside of

108
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,250
that you want to put your family in

109
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,650
first two things you want to do with

110
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,240
your family the things that they've

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,130
asked of you you have to make time

112
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,700
available for them if you do not do that

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,690
trading is going to be very very

114
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,820
stressful because number one your

115
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,590
children your spouse they're gonna

116
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,120
interrupt you when you're looking at the

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,340
charts or trying to trade if they are

118
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,160
home at the time now if you're looking

119
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,710
to trade the month and open or the New

120
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,479
York session and it's throwing the

121
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,120
school session time then probably your

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,370
spouse may be working or she could make

123
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,010
herself or he can make himself scarce

124
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,990
while you do what you got to do and the

125
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,780
kids are at school let me close the same

126
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,940
type of thing at least I'm referring to

127
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,880
those in the North American States at

128
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,150
least as it goes with my time zone which

129
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,600
is relatively the same as New York time

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,700
but you have to balance that and there's

131
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,490
so many variables there it's up to you

132
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,240
to decide which one's going to be

133
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,100
applicable for you now I know that

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,330
primarily especially those I've studied

135
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,510
my free tutorials they want to be in the

136
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,160
London session because it offers the

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,349
most volatility and it gives you the

138
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,810
biggest portion of the range of a daily

139
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,240
range it's not necessary

140
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,509
to do that okay so I try to teach like I

141
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,849
taught when it first stepped out as a

142
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:37,030
Forex mentor 2010 fight primarily just

143
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,789
dealing with Forex were willing students

144
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,000
that you'd only you only need 25 pips a

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,860
week that's it

146
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,220
now what I'm gonna show you here tonight

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,910
is how you can get that one set up okay

148
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,940
based on a time of day and you can get

149
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,949
those 25 pips for a week

150
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,069
it may take you two trades or three

151
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,919
trades if there's a opportunity where

152
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,740
you don't get your full pool as far as

153
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,630
your target and you have to do another

154
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,069
trade maybe it's a losing trade you have

155
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,199
to take another one to recoup that and

156
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
get your balance that you're aiming for

157
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,930
but it's far easier to make a low end

158
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,590
objective between Monday and Friday than

159
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,270
it is to try to get 150 pips or 200 pips

160
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,669
you don't have enough range in the

161
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,370
weekly range to be able to do that

162
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,828
consistently if you don't know what

163
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,539
you're doing and you're rushing and

164
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,839
you're not really focusing so what I

165
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,750
teach is folks should be focusing on a

166
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,539
very low end objective something that

167
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,300
can be obtained rather easy now I say

168
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,060
that with quotations okay I'm not saying

169
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,410
that a new trade is going to step in the

170
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,410
market and easily find 25 pips that's

171
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,730
not going to happen there's some things

172
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,130
you have to learn about yourself and you

173
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,870
have to learn about the market place but

174
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,700
they're very generic things like we're

175
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,649
going to talk about tonight and you've

176
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,600
seen many times what I'm going to refer

177
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,610
to but I want you to really think about

178
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,600
in terms of an exercise because as I

179
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,430
mentioned in the first video in this

180
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,720
series and there's only two parts this

181
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,120
is the last part on this specific series

182
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,079
I mentioned that as a new trader you

183
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,120
shouldn't be doing anything more than

184
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,890
thirty minutes a day in terms of your

185
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,290
study so that means whatever video

186
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,750
you're watching it needs to be thirty

187
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,990
minutes of that only and stop because it

188
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,360
gives you an opportunity to reflect on

189
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,310
what you're learning and it builds

190
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,770
anticipation about your next study

191
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,209
session you don't want to be burnt out

192
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,540
you don't be

193
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,829
boring yourself because I have a

194
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,170
tendency to go on and on and drone about

195
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,990
things that are rather dry but they're

196
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,149
important but if you don't retain them

197
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,920
and that's why it's important to go back

198
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,370
over my videos because the number one

199
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,100
repeating Tennant is that folks get more

200
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,360
information out of the videos by

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,980
watching on multiple times because

202
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,470
they're rather boring ok is that the

203
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,050
content is very dry what makes it

204
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,000
exciting and that's what I'm kind of

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,740
gonna ring in tonight with this volume

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,019
is what you're supposed to be doing in

207
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,110
those study moments ok your 15 minute

208
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,930
block of study time or 30 minute block

209
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,930
of study time you have to find that time

210
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,209
within those 24 hours that's up to you I

211
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,269
can't do that for you because your life

212
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,160
and your your job and whatever that goes

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,750
on in your personal life are gonna

214
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,019
dictate where that's available but

215
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,940
whatever you do try to be consistent

216
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,589
about it that way you have something to

217
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,199
look forward to throughout the day until

218
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,399
you get to that study moment and then

219
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,930
you can focus and then you'd limit your

220
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,170
time set an alarm for your start time to

221
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,319
do it and set a ending time so that way

222
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,110
you are forcing yourself to be rigid and

223
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,940
disciplined you only spend this much

224
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,649
time and your study and then leave it

225
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,100
alone your spouse and your children even

226
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,839
not so much your children because

227
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,060
they're not gonna really appreciate what

228
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,920
you're doing and the balancing act is

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,199
required with all this but your spouse

230
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,750
will certainly respect that because I

231
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,810
can tell you I have had a lot of

232
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,730
arguments over the years with my spouse

233
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,240
about how much time I devote to this and

234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,370
to teaching and making videos and

235
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,430
tutorials and notes and all those types

236
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,130
of things in answering email it's been a

237
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,760
lot of work for me as an educator well

238
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,529
that's not the same workload that you'll

239
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,139
have as a developing trader sometimes it

240
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,019
will feel like that because if you have

241
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,839
not scheduled your family time outside

242
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,480
of your work time made time for them

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,759
that way when you are alone with your

244
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,819
charts they don't feel cheated because

245
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,510
even if they aren't saying anything

246
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,290
gentlemen you'll know what I'm talking

247
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,620
about

248
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,490
mostly here the look your spouse will

249
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:55,700
get

250
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,410
when they look in over your shoulder and

251
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,390
you look over at them and here you are

252
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,680
sitting in front of charts again it's

253
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,500
like you're with a mistress okay and you

254
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,610
know what I'm talking about that look

255
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,800
they give you you're doing that again or

256
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
you're on there for you know for two

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,340
long time when you're gonna spend time

258
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,850
with us or with me particularly so it's

259
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,620
not something that you know is unique to

260
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,830
me okay anyone that spends any time with

261
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,370
the market it tends to be a very cruel

262
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,400
lover and by that I mean it's it demands

263
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,830
your time it demands your attention and

264
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,060
your focus so while it's necessary to

265
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,430
give that to it okay and I'm personally

266
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,870
giving personification to the

267
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,660
marketplace a lot in my references to it

268
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,330
but I want you to feel like it's someone

269
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,060
that could get you in trouble okay it's

270
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,860
the friend that if you allow that

271
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,530
friendship to go too far it becomes a

272
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,810
problem okay you you overstep your

273
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,970
boundaries so you have to keep things in

274
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,020
balance you gotta keep things in check

275
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,400
and keep things in a list of priority

276
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,340
obviously I'll let you guys argue which

277
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,140
one's am more important whether it read

278
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,420
the job or your family I would venture

279
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,090
to say if you don't have funds you know

280
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,580
your your jobs pretty much you know

281
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,860
first because you need funds to take

282
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,320
care of your family and then family is

283
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,300
second and then your free time is

284
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,310
bounced with whatever you do outside of

285
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,070
there's two matric consumers of your

286
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,700
time and again apart from sleep so you

287
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,070
want to have your focus on what you're

288
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,260
doing with your family be very specific

289
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,510
with your time budget your time with

290
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,660
them and then let your spouse and your

291
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,520
children know when you're going to be

292
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,920
involved with the market that way they

293
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,050
don't disturb you they respect your time

294
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,600
doing it and if you keep it in a real

295
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,900
modest amount of time each day it won't

296
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,060
be hard for them to give you that

297
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,850
opportunity to do that now this way

298
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,220
while you're thinking that that fifteen

299
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,960
or thirty minute block of study time is

300
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,630
far too little time it's not going to be

301
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,550
because you'll be much more efficiently

302
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,250
using that time

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,510
because you're not going to be stressing

304
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,730
about being interrupted or feeling

305
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,339
guilty about why you're doing it what is

306
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,130
your family and spouse what are they

307
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,959
thinking about what you're doing because

308
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,570
last thing you want to do is having that

309
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,209
over top of your your shoulder if you

310
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,490
will you're whispering in your ear you

311
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,810
know you know when you're done with this

312
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,430
you your spouse is going to have an

313
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,990
attitude or your children's going to

314
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,370
have their feelings hurt because you

315
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,050
didn't spend time with them doing

316
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,250
whatever it is you were supposed to be

317
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,410
doing in their eyes so this way you've

318
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,050
budgeted your time in that 24 hour block

319
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,440
of time which makes a day this way you

320
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,329
have no guilt you have no distractions

321
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,850
and your time is completely and utterly

322
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,310
devoted to the marketplace so that way

323
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,740
the things that you're doing while

324
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,560
they're not a lot of time itself with 30

325
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,889
minutes of time of study it is quality

326
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,230
time so you don't want to spend a great

327
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,910
deal of time with the time that you do

328
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,529
spend you want to spend it without

329
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,810
distraction so if you're gonna be

330
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,570
focusing on Asia okay I want to build an

331
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,699
idea of realism and kind of give you

332
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,990
expectation if you will of what you

333
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,410
should be doing each day okay so when

334
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,980
you're studying again I'm speaking from

335
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,750
this perspective that you've already

336
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,160
went through my free tutorials so

337
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,720
therefore you're not gorging yourself

338
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,329
with videos every day or hours upon

339
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,360
hours what should you be focusing on as

340
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,120
a student that has already gone through

341
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,130
the free content what you should be

342
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,370
focusing on for Asia beach day this is

343
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,529
what you want to be basically doing okay

344
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,790
it's an exercise of logging past price

345
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,490
action now I learned everything that I

346
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,459
teach and I use in the marketplace by

347
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,649
doing this very thing here so do not

348
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,839
discount it don't think that it's a

349
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,670
waste of time because I'm telling you

350
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,610
you gain so much experience by doing it

351
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,589
and by having a record of it and keeping

352
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,880
a study journal keeping each day on one

353
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,589
or two pairs if you want to be crazy

354
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,380
about it if you do this you will be

355
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,319
doing a 30-minute block of time each day

356
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,260
doing it if you want to do the majors

357
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,390
like all the dollar pairs anything it's

358
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,520
coupled with a dollar it'll take you a

359
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
good 30 minute 20 or 30 minutes to do it

360
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,110
but Trivedi's do like one or two pairs

361
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,210
and really spend some quality time

362
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,030
studying it and all sessions you know

363
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,860
whatever session that you're you're

364
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,650
focusing on that one particular is the

365
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,840
only one you're looking at now if you

366
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,870
want to add more for completeness sake

367
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,490
and obviously you can use the other

368
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,800
remaining three sessions of the day so

369
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,840
Lawrence if you're looking at London as

370
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,910
your specific time of day you'll be

371
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,240
studying you can add the New York London

372
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,020
clothes and the Asian session as bonuses

373
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,209
if you will and I'll kind of give you an

374
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,530
example what that looks like with this

375
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,339
whole presentation tonight but the

376
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,400
unique portions of a day if you're gonna

377
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,770
be focusing on as an example here say

378
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,589
Asia if that's going to be the time of

379
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,300
day that you have available for study

380
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,329
then this is what you'll do okay so

381
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,319
obviously looking at this chart like

382
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,420
this it doesn't mean too much it looks

383
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,220
rather random and that's typical okay

384
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,520
but over time if you start applying the

385
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440
ideas that I teach in my free tutorials

386
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,660
the clarity will come and you can see

387
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,290
things that normally aren't observable

388
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,500
by the retail trader as you can see here

389
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,590
by adding the vertical lines delineating

390
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,570
the asian session going into the new

391
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,180
york time in new york of midnight and

392
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,540
identifying order blocks and where sell

393
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,590
stop liquidity pools are and aiming for

394
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,010
those specific things after the market

395
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,790
runs up to a very clear bearish order

396
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,760
block now what you're doing is is you're

397
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,280
teaching yourself to see this in

398
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,420
hindsight you want to have at least

399
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,160
three months worth of a study journal

400
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,260
filled with every single day Monday

401
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,180
through Friday with at least one

402
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,210
specific currency pair okay by doing

403
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,590
this you'll be

404
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,600
go back and look at these unique

405
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,820
examples every single time you want to

406
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,010
look at them it's like having all of

407
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,500
that three-month experience looking at

408
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,320
that specific time of day now imagine

409
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,340
doing that for 12 months if you do that

410
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,260
and you continuously do it as a

411
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,620
developing trader and a well-groomed

412
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,340
trader I do all of my sessions like this

413
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,390
with the fiber and cable it's in my own

414
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,140
unique study journal I keep my own

415
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,610
charts doctored up with all these types

416
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,130
of things and it keeps things in my mind

417
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,429
when I'm looking at price action

418
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,799
something will inherently be jogged in

419
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,380
my memory when I see a specific element

420
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,929
on price action narrowing live trading

421
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,370
if I'm looking at the charts during a

422
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,020
specific time of day like New York and

423
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,620
London if I see something that's acting

424
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,380
you know it may not be apparent on my

425
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,830
chart

426
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,659
because a lot of times I'll go back to a

427
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:36,890
naked chart when I'm watching because I

428
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,289
don't want to go in with any

429
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,360
preconceived ideas about what should

430
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,909
happen okay if I I'm unsure about the

431
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,409
market place I want to go back to a

432
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,320
clean slate if you will and have a blank

433
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,590
chart but many times my mind they'll be

434
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,520
reminding myself of things I've had

435
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,779
recently noted in my journal okay and

436
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,970
this is what a journal entry looked like

437
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,630
for me for Asian session okay so this is

438
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,250
what my chart looked like for this

439
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,140
particular day so I'm showing you what

440
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,870
my charts look like right now as they go

441
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,640
into my journal now there's a lot of

442
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,990
other things obviously the mentorship

443
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,470
would know about that are also added to

444
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,020
this but from a free tutorial standpoint

445
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,919
this is all free tutorial level content

446
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,110
but don't be discouraged thinking oh

447
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,149
well he's holding things back and I'm

448
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:30,679
not gonna have enough information and do

449
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,659
anything it's not true because you can

450
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:35,870
do a lot with the free tutorials but you

451
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,240
have to be very very disciplined and you

452
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,340
have to do a lot of work and you

453
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,049
discover things by trial and error by

454
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,299
doing it through the free tutorials with

455
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,580
the mentorship I kind of like show you

456
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,190
what to avoid and do specifically and

457
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,759
look for this and don't do that

458
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,879
okay that type of thing but there's two

459
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,320
avenues you guys can choose to you know

460
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,269
take whatever path you want I'm talking

461
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:00,059
for the free student in these lessons

462
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,729
okay so my asian session notes for euro

463
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:09,509
dollar today look like this okay you

464
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,479
know without the inclusion of all the

465
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,179
mentorship stuff this is sufficient okay

466
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,440
you can see that there has been a clear

467
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,389
bearish order block price broke down

468
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:24,209
moved back up - it's sold off here then

469
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:25,499
we went into consolidation which is

470
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,679
typical for the Asian session the market

471
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,009
runs above a short term high in here

472
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:39,419
back into the order block here and also

473
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,819
goes to the extreme end of this last up

474
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,349
close candle here now these are

475
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:47,039
15-minute time frames so you could argue

476
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,959
and say well you know these are very

477
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:53,459
very minor time frames therefore the

478
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,919
candlesticks shouldn't be that important

479
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,589
or significant but they are significant

480
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,739
and they are influential when you apply

481
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,899
the time factor okay so time of day is

482
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:06,359
very important we know that this time of

483
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,369
day is typically a consolidation portion

484
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,869
of the day so if you're going to trade

485
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,849
in Asia it's very very important your

486
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:13,589
your objective for pips are gonna be

487
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:16,169
drastically reduced okay there's gonna

488
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,999
be times when the asian session really

489
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,729
tears off and just starts to run but

490
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,919
generally and this is why you want to do

491
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,799
this you'll see that the normal

492
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,389
characteristic for this time of day is

493
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,539
it's very quiet so therefore you have to

494
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,719
have a very low-end pip objective if

495
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,789
you're gonna be trading this or studying

496
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,549
it but price goes up hits the order

497
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,459
block runs down and goes below the low

498
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,259
here whereas else top liquidity people

499
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:44,429
would be resting and you see that

500
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,649
reaching into it right here okay and

501
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:47,879
then look at the nice little reaction

502
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,029
after that now it's not a lot of hips

503
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:53,789
it's not a lot of movement but it's very

504
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,039
very consistent if you look at the

505
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,319
action Monday through Friday for three

506
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,059
months looking at one particular

507
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,500
currency pair

508
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,310
you will start to see these repeating

509
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,210
characteristics that are very generic

510
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,860
and do not you know random okay as I

511
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,870
have here facetiously placed on that

512
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,790
little rectangle what I'm highlighting

513
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,010
there is the actual Asian session

514
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,310
killzone as i define it so the setup

515
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,870
would be seen here it trades up in the

516
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,280
bearish order block and then runs for

517
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,510
the cells that look pretty cool

518
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,980
all right out of the scalping modules

519
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,290
that I gave for my youtube channel you

520
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,290
can find them on my website at the inner

521
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,340
circle trader.com

522
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
just join the forum it's free it doesn't

523
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,690
cost you join a thing there and you can

524
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,420
keep a running collection of all my

525
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,360
YouTube videos there it's all for your

526
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,230
enjoyment and edification but for those

527
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,210
individuals that are not focusing on

528
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,870
Asia during your time of study you may

529
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,960
be looking for London okay so when

530
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,280
London is defined as shown here we will

531
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,850
be looking at past data every single day

532
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,260
and you want to note the portions of

533
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,480
price action that would be seen for the

534
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,610
London open kill zone for that this is

535
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,940
what you would see here okay you have an

536
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,120
initial high so we think that the market

537
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,380
is going to expand higher run that old

538
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,140
high out so there'd be buy stops resting

539
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,840
above that and I'm highlighting here the

540
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,220
London open kill zone and what's missing

541
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,470
here why would make that a specific

542
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,250
price point to be a buy look very

543
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,490
closely and you'll see an ICT bullish

544
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,750
breaker okay we had all these lows over

545
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,640
here very clean level you know that Liz

546
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,760
it's candy land for cell stops price

547
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,990
trades lower clears all the stops and

548
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,410
goes above this high trades back down

549
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,540
into during the London open kill zone

550
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,220
okay you

551
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,250
would be your my right in here aiming

552
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,500
for the bye stops as they run on

553
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,020
liquidity so your opportunity would be

554
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,299
buying here on the bullish breaker

555
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,580
without wrong gonna buy stuff and that's

556
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,919
all you would necessarily look for for

557
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,809
the London open kill zone and your day

558
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:36,659
would be done but for those individuals

559
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,970
that are just studying it looking for

560
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,770
case studies every single day to build

561
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,510
up a experience reference over a period

562
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,809
of time is ongoing your chart would look

563
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,610
like this okay this is how I have my

564
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,700
chart for today and obviously it's very

565
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,830
informative insightful when you have it

566
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,450
like this because it builds a lot of

567
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,169
understanding about what is being

568
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,770
reacted off of in price action now again

569
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,840
you want to have these every single

570
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,480
trading day okay it's not important to

571
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
trade now if you're learning you do not

572
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,590
trade you don't even put demo trades on

573
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,860
this is how you learn you do this every

574
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,799
single day you log it Monday through

575
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,690
Friday and then on the weekends when you

576
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,490
have more study time as I shown in the

577
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,620
first video when you have about an hour

578
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,150
or so or a couple hours so that you can

579
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,929
devote to then you can spend time going

580
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,780
back over the previous week what price

581
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,090
did out reacted and how each individual

582
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,789
day dovetailed into the next day

583
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,830
the kind of Monday trade into Tuesday

584
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,260
and having Tuesday trade into Wednesday

585
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,330
and Wednesday into Thursday and what

586
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,039
relationships Thursday and Monday half

587
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,840
or Tuesday and Thursday what

588
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,090
relationships were there for that or

589
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,450
Friday was there any kind of a

590
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,870
retracement or a high or low formed any

591
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,940
specific day and you want to make notes

592
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,429
on that during the weekend go back in

593
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:07,049
the old charts like for instance this

594
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:09,450
one here I may make references on this

595
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,909
chart on Saturday when I go back and go

596
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:13,799
through all my data for the week that

597
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,659
I've collected this is what I'm doing it

598
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,140
on now I use a 15-minute time frame

599
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,850
because it gives me a lot of intraday

600
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,760
price action and it refines my fractals

601
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,059
into a really small element of time now

602
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,799
I don't like to do it on a 5-minute

603
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,550
chart because it's too much

604
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,070
noisy timeframe and obviously one

605
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,480
minutes is ridiculous so I'm not

606
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,740
interested there but I do a lot of my

607
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,630
notations on a 15-minute time frame now

608
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,010
if there's times when the element behind

609
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,080
the setup is more closely seen or

610
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,840
clearly seen rather by way of an hourly

611
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,400
chart I'll include an hourly chart

612
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,520
perspective but still nonetheless most

613
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,890
of my notations will be on the 15 at a

614
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,850
time frame okay now again looking at

615
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,680
like this doesn't mean much to people

616
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,750
that have this fascination with

617
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,030
indicators because you want to have

618
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,190
oversold you wanna have moving averages

619
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,150
meant these you Bollinger Bands all

620
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,730
kinds of variations of the theme because

621
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,640
it looks smart looks technical and again

622
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,290
all those things don't do anything to

623
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,480
make price move catered distractions I

624
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,890
know what elements in price and time are

625
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,620
going to be influential I know it

626
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,480
because I've done this exercise for

627
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,740
decades you will learn the same way if

628
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,900
you do this if you don't do these types

629
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,920
of things you're actually cheating

630
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,870
yourself because you're not teaching

631
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,510
yourself how to be a price action trader

632
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,790
you're going to be wasting a lot of your

633
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,710
time and what you want to be doing with

634
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,200
your time is focusing on what's happened

635
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
in the past because if you study that

636
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,280
and you see it over and over and over

637
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,050
again it's like anything remember when

638
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,240
you were in grade school and you were

639
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,310
learning math at least for me it was we

640
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,290
had to do flashcards okay I did would

641
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,830
hold up

642
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,530
you know simple arithmetic patterns or

643
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,010
problems like what's two plus four and

644
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,300
on the back of the card it would be an

645
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,370
answer six and the person would hold the

646
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,440
card up flash it to you and you give

647
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,150
your answer and if you're right they big

648
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,350
flash and say you can get you're wrong

649
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,450
or right rather so this same element of

650
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,090
repetition doing it every single day in

651
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,700
your own notations in your own words

652
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,710
you're creating the chart so that way

653
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,690
your subconscious is remembering it it's

654
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,110
recording it you're building up your

655
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,790
sensitivity to it because you keep

656
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,700
seeing it over and over and over again

657
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,220
in your notations and in your

658
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,230
and then at the end of the week on the

659
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,039
weekend you're referring to it again

660
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,840
three months of doing this which are

661
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,820
actually doing is you're building a

662
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,220
responsiveness a sensitivity to these

663
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,880
characteristics that are uniquely

664
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,530
specific to these times of the day

665
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,480
that's why it's important whatever one

666
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,820
you're going to choose you need to stick

667
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,250
to that one and don't try to do more

668
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,020
than that okay for those even more

669
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,230
formally you know used to seeing my

670
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,030
content have been using it for a while

671
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,039
and have been profitable with it then

672
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,320
obviously you can do more sessions of

673
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,760
the day and include that in your journal

674
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,980
but as a developing trader that you're

675
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,679
new to my content or you tried it in the

676
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,500
past and it didn't didn't hit with you

677
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,679
and now you're coming back to me this is

678
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,760
the way you want to study it

679
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,470
okay put three months into doing this

680
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,289
and I'm promising you it will transform

681
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:45,539
your perception about price action and

682
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,090
it will refine you as a better trader

683
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,490
now again you may study the limit

684
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,770
session and eventually come to the

685
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,450
conclusion that it's not a time frame

686
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,000
for you maybe you thought it was going

687
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,640
to be a good session for you but the

688
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,409
next session the New York session ends

689
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,380
up becoming a more appropriate time of

690
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,340
day again to the untrained eye looks

691
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,230
like random price action it's not giving

692
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,390
you any kind of insights here what you

693
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,309
want to do is just go back Monday

694
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,409
through Friday your particular pair of

695
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:19,350
choice or two pairs but primarily you

696
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,510
want to pick one you're going to be a

697
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,809
specialist in go back and add all your

698
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,900
details okay and what you want to do is

699
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,820
you want to basically try to explain

700
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,309
with the benefit of hindsight what took

701
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,080
place with ICT concepts if you do this

702
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,059
again every single day Monday through

703
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,190
Friday for three months for one

704
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,370
particular session time of day in this

705
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,179
case it's New York if you do this again

706
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,520
you will build a far vast far more vast

707
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,720
understanding about the characteristics

708
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,270
about that time of day then doing

709
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,120
anything else

710
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,090
it's not risking any money it's not

711
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,820
building an excitement or enthusiasm

712
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,520
about making money and it doesn't build

713
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,520
fear about losing it okay what you're

714
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,380
doing is you're teaching yourself in an

715
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,690
element in an environment where you're

716
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,610
not focusing on the money you're

717
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,220
focusing on the process this is the

718
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,919
process I get a lot of questions even by

719
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,390
people that are in my mentorship

720
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:27,370
it's month four okay or during month

721
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,049
seven and they're saying you know I

722
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,370
don't really know what I'm supposed to

723
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,090
be doing right now

724
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,010
sure you do I've given you lots of

725
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,260
exercises and thing to focusing on but

726
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,750
they want to go into the markets and

727
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,850
start trading right away okay and they

728
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,679
have not submitted to the process the

729
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,200
process is you learn 12 months of core

730
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,350
content then you go into a demo account

731
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,409
for six months minimum applying things

732
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,480
like I'm showing you here going in

733
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,260
taking notes on charts and building an

734
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,809
experience library in your mind

735
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,230
I can't transpose my experience into

736
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,970
anyone I would love to be able to do

737
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,480
that but I can't so the way you get that

738
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,250
experience and the way you submit to the

739
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,039
process and to time this is what you do

740
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,409
you draw the notations on your chart and

741
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,630
you go through the process every single

742
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,409
day whether you've taken a trade or say

743
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,929
we go fast forward into time say you've

744
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:24,940
been active in the marketplace and

745
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,500
you've been using the concepts and

746
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,350
you're making money but you take a

747
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,230
losing trade now obviously you want to

748
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,830
log what you did wrong and don't beat

749
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,419
yourself up about what you've done

750
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:43,539
don't use emotional descriptors or

751
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,169
adjectives in your new commentary you

752
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,299
don't want to beat yourself up and you

753
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,309
want to focus on the things you did well

754
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:54,669
and use descriptors and adjectives that

755
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:57,460
are positive around that that way your

756
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,080
subconscious doesn't link these

757
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,240
experiences to negative and then they

758
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,279
become a barrier to your trading because

759
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,020
your subconscious will remind you that

760
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,549
the last time you took a trade it was

761
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,530
painful and you'll be wrestling

762
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,239
internally about it you won't realize

763
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,340
you're doing it but

764
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,260
it's very powerful our mind is very very

765
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,159
powerful so if we have these examples of

766
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,260
no emotion in our study journal it kind

767
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,870
of like fills in that void that would

768
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,610
have been painful because we've taken a

769
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,940
loss maybe we go back in and draw out

770
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,340
what took place and then now you filled

771
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,870
in that gap with a positive element and

772
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,900
it masks that negative element that you

773
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,239
took a loss you don't want to focus on

774
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,320
the law so you don't want to focus on

775
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,120
the monetary pain okay you want to

776
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,440
figure out what you did wrong and what

777
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,270
took place in the marketplace and you

778
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,949
learn from that all of my best lessons

779
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,429
come by way of losing okay and then I go

780
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,830
back in at the end of the day I look at

781
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,540
what I've seen in the marketplace and I

782
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,240
mapped out like I show here this is my

783
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,330
actual chart again today for your $1.00

784
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,050
for the New York session with this

785
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,080
information here now I didn't know you

786
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,790
see you seen when I did you know today I

787
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,770
was long on Eurodollar

788
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,710
but this is what was a result later on

789
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,400
the day the market went to 11721 maybe

790
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,610
New York reversal and then traded lower

791
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,470
and that didn't reverse entirely on a

792
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,080
day from the high and make a lower low

793
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,050
or trade below the open but it did have

794
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,060
a reversal they offered up a pretty good

795
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,670
opportunity you can see the intraday

796
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,920
high here initially that set up our New

797
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,770
York session by it ran the buy stops

798
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,490
here and caused the turtle soup sell the

799
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,350
opportunity was between selling it here

800
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,480
above the old high and reaching for the

801
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,600
cell stops below here as it seemed

802
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,430
trading below it there okay so the

803
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,650
opportunity was in between here for a

804
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,490
New York session

805
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,040
market reversal profile now you're gonna

806
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,110
find many times at the New York session

807
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,070
by having this done every single day

808
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,810
predominantly you're gonna find the New

809
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,570
York session is a continuation of a

810
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,910
London session now there's going to be

811
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,130
factors that you'll learn by doing this

812
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,830
when the session will be a continuation

813
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,560
or when it will be a reversal now I'm

814
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,020
not teaching you that here because

815
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,360
mentorship stuff but I promise you if

816
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,990
you do enough of this you'll find one or

817
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,020
two specific criterias that will allow

818
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,120
you to anticipate when a market reversal

819
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,820
profile should come nothing's perfect

820
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,800
even in the mentorship there's nothing

821
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,770
perfect but it's more insight and more

822
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,370
experience by doing this if you don't do

823
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,050
it you're cheating yourself and you're

824
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,680
robbing yourself of valuable experience

825
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,010
that you just you can't beat it I mean

826
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,650
you can sit down if you have a day off

827
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,390
of work and you can go back literally

828
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,630
over a couple weeks and do this okay and

829
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,750
build in a great deal of history in your

830
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,030
study journal but in the beginning you

831
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,740
don't want to do that you just start

832
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,490
fresh with today or yesterday and build

833
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,370
your study journal up and you'll be on

834
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:24,840
your way for those that can't do the New

835
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,570
York open or London open or Asia an

836
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,790
opportunity can be seen by using the

837
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,990
London closed now London closed again is

838
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,480
another day time of day rather it's

839
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,820
similar to that of the Asian session

840
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,830
it's very low in terms of volatility

841
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,380
does have some quirky characteristics to

842
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,230
it but from for the most part it usually

843
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,920
has the the capping effect of the daily

844
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,780
range moving from a make a chart to more

845
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,540
notations this is how I internalize what

846
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,800
took place for London clothes you can

847
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,110
see here the rectangle is highlighting

848
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,190
the London clothes killzone as I define

849
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,230
it market trades up into a bearish

850
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,940
quarter block seen here trades up to it

851
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,060
here and it attacks the cell stops below

852
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,280
here and you reach this back down into

853
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,960
the ICT bullish breaker here trades down

854
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,240
exactly to the very low to the pip okay

855
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,790
and for those students of support

856
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,850
resistance if you like that trades back

857
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,809
down to the old high here

858
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,609
but specifically how we pick real

859
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,019
support/resistance is based on

860
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,789
institutional order flow and reading

861
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:44,380
price action and the best way of doing

862
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,219
that is studying my ICT breaker pattern

863
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:49,689
beautiful reaction off of that once it

864
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:50,859
trades down to the lowest end of the

865
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:53,739
breaker and pulls off that low and

866
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:57,369
starts going to consolidation now again

867
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,029
because this is a type of pattern in the

868
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,579
day that's very low volatility generally

869
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,999
the characteristic is going to require

870
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:10,719
your adherence to expecting or look for

871
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,589
very low in pip objectives not like that

872
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,559
you would see in London session or New

873
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:23,680
York session which brings us to if you'd

874
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,849
be focusing on the London session you

875
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,549
can anticipate a realistic 20 to 30 pips

876
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:34,119
on the london session many times you can

877
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,859
get more than that but I build in this

878
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:38,349
expectation as a developing trigger so

879
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:40,779
that way if you are actively demo

880
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:43,150
trading it this is what you should be

881
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,119
aiming for this is your first profit

882
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,949
objective if you hold on for the rest of

883
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,679
the day obviously you can do that but in

884
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,150
London you're gonna be looking to take

885
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,660
profits at 20 or 30 pips scale your risk

886
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,390
is as low as you can but still keep the

887
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,519
trade open you don't want to choke or

888
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,259
strangle the trade but you want to pay

889
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:04,119
yourself when you can get it 20 or 30

890
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,949
pips in London okay because you could

891
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:07,719
reach you very well could read London

892
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,099
wrong you're trading the New York

893
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,289
session

894
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:16,959
realistically 20 pips for that time of

895
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,019
day

896
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:24,710
Londyn close 10 to 15 pips now there's

897
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,940
some of you're thinking of 10 steps

898
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,650
that's not even worth it well what if

899
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,740
you did 10 pips every single day it's 50

900
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,200
pips a week I'm looking for 50 to 75

901
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,019
pips a week I'm telling you if you

902
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,069
understand this factor of trading with

903
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,069
using a 50 hip objective for the week

904
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:45,230
you have no problem finding those 50

905
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,440
pips if you are flexible and you are

906
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,720
eventually trading for a living you can

907
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,759
do a session in the London session if

908
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,650
you miss it or if you get it wrong you

909
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,150
can hopefully recoup it in the New York

910
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,049
session and go flat for the day or if

911
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:01,579
you made your money back and you see a

912
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,710
very strong set up in London close you

913
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,299
can get your 10 pips for the day or

914
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,789
maybe 15 pips and if you're doing that

915
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:09,740
it leaves only a balance of thirty five

916
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,950
pips if you got 15 for London closed 50

917
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,230
- 15 you got thirty five pips the rest

918
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,700
of the week to make it and you've made

919
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,730
your net 50 pips eventually when you're

920
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,559
treating saying I'm $1 per point or pip

921
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:27,170
that's a good week 50 pips is a very

922
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,460
handsome week I don't know where you're

923
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,089
from but you know that's a good living

924
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:35,900
and finally Asia another tunnel day

925
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,119
where 10 to 15 pips is realistic in

926
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:45,200
terms of a pip haul or objective if you

927
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,259
are going to be trading Asia I have to

928
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:52,910
say this you will find many times it's

929
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,769
not going to give you a setup that is as

930
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,519
consistent as the New York and London

931
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,609
also in your notes you should have

932
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:09,109
typically Asia or London clothes gives

933
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,630
the better setup so in other words if

934
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,339
Asia is really really quiet and it

935
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,470
doesn't give you a set up means

936
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,539
generally that lemon close that same day

937
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:21,529
will give it to you in contrast if Asia

938
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:24,109
gives you a very nice move that

939
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,730
typically means that London close will

940
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,109
be quiet later on in the day okay so

941
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:31,220
what I want you to take away from this

942
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,619
video is a way of balancing your time

943
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,299
targeting specific times of the day for

944
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,569
study budgeting and being a good steward

945
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,430
with your time and also balancing your

946
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,969
family life and your sleep time and your

947
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:48,420
work time but you only need to focus on

948
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,569
one of these a day not every single one

949
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,910
of them don't sneak one while you're

950
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,849
working okay or while you're at dinner

951
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,469
with your family

952
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,839
looking at your smartphone don't do that

953
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,749
because number one it's not fair to them

954
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,999
it's not fair to you because you're

955
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:07,859
distracted and you shouldn't be doing

956
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,979
two things at one time you can't keep

957
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:13,259
your money in the forefront of your mind

958
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:16,229
and still be respecting and spending

959
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:17,489
quality time with your family it can't

960
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,829
you can't have it so you're gonna have

961
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,349
to pick what time of day you're doing

962
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,279
what and then stick to that and if you

963
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:28,920
do that I promise you it won't be

964
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,190
perfect I promise you you will still

965
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,799
lose money I promise you that you still

966
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:36,210
will probably get in arguments with your

967
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,140
spouse and your kids will be

968
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,660
disappointed because you'll still do

969
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,249
something when they would rather be

970
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:42,599
doing something else with you at that

971
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,249
time but if you show them your results

972
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,499
over time they will be more likely to

973
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:55,349
see things like your hopefully wanting

974
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:58,349
them to and allowing you to do what

975
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,369
you're trying to do and you're

976
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:01,200
passionate about dealing right now which

977
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,660
is speculation for a living and if you

978
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,359
do this type of skill set and practice

979
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,609
and exercise and being disciplined about

980
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:10,229
budgeting your time and managing your

981
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:12,539
time efficiently you'll be well on your

982
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,539
way to reaching that objective and until

983
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,069
next time I wish you good luck and good

984
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,969
trading
