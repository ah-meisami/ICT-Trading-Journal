1
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:31,100
14:40 what does that number mean to you

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,990
for most of you probably doesn't mean

3
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,630
anything at all but you live it every

4
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,360
single day that's the number of minutes

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,040
you know 24 hour span of time now most

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,170
of you are anticipating some super slide

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,890
devilishly named concept or technique to

8
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,520
be released in some ICT video next and I

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,420
am here just to kind of like remind you

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,410
that are new to this or maybe that

11
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,320
certain person that's been here for

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,570
months or maybe years they just can't

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,990
find a way to make time if you're

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,280
developing trailer this is gonna mean

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,380
much more to you because you haven't

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,729
been met with the challenges of seeing

17
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,130
where Trading is gonna fit in your life

18
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,390
every single 24 hour span of time can be

19
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,090
broken down into modular components time

20
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,860
management as a trader as a developing

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,289
trader a student of the markets is

22
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,000
absolutely paramount because you can

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,310
spend a lot of your time doing the wrong

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,550
things and doing them at the wrong time

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,000
and doing much more than that's

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,369
reasonably expected to have a

27
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,649
progressive developmental curve

28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,830
I want you to think about that 24 hour

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,280
span of time and if we were to break it

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,670
up into individual components in the

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,030
scale 15 minute increments each one of

32
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,709
these boxes would represent one

33
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,410
15-minute span of time out of a 24 hour

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:28,860
period

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,690
every four squares across would be

36
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,510
representative of a full one hour span

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,420
of time the entire length from top to

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,180
bottom would represent 24 hours of time

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,709
so with 24 hours at our disposal each

40
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,799
day we're left with the challenge of how

41
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,440
we're going to spend it now for some of

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,010
you most of that time is already made up

43
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,500
and it's outside of your hands in terms

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,299
of controlling where it is and what

45
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,680
you'll be doing at those specific times

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,390
of the day as a trader if you are I'm

47
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,390
using my quotations with fingers blessed

48
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,870
to have the opportunity to be a

49
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,209
full-time trader and deriving your

50
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,959
income from the markets themselves you

51
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,900
are given the freedom to determine where

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,209
and when you're going to do your

53
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,920
business hours however for a developing

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,579
trader you're plagued with the normal

55
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:49,730
realistic well pitfalls and barriers of

56
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,709
having a job a family and a life there's

57
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,829
a lot that's been talked about by

58
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,660
mentors teachers educators and such

59
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,489
about trading buy here sell here

60
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,709
you know don't put your stop-loss here

61
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,840
don't use this indicator use that

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,639
indicator don't listen to that guy

63
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,910
listen to this guy but far too little

64
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,480
has been spent on how to efficiently use

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,858
your time not only as a student but also

66
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,590
as a trader so I want to do a two part

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,080
series and this is the

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,879
first part but right now I just want you

69
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,439
to take a moment and think how have you

70
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,250
spent the last 24 hours

71
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,810
could you go back through your 24 hour

72
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,870
span of time and fill in each one of

73
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,539
these 15 minute incremental blocks with

74
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,189
what you were doing now it doesn't have

75
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,340
to be a long list or an expose of what

76
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,930
it is and who you're with and what you

77
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,740
were doing exactly but if we made

78
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,389
generalized categories sleep work play

79
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,849
family time food dressing if we kept it

80
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,430
to those simple categories could you go

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,789
back for your 24 hour time and law what

82
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,379
you were doing at that specific time of

83
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:17,370
day if the first block or row represents

84
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,449
1:00 a.m. that first row would be

85
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,270
representative 1:00 a.m. to the next

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,650
block of 2:00 a.m. the midpoint of this

87
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,550
grid would be noontime in the afternoon

88
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,979
and then 12:00 a.m. will be the bottom

89
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,659
so it represented the entire 24-hour

90
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:43,889
span of time I gave the responsibility

91
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,860
of one of my students to fill in their

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,469
general day what what they do on the

93
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,500
regular okay and this is actually a new

94
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
student so it's not someone that's been

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,089
trading for a while or knows how to

96
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,370
trade this is someone that has just

97
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,830
recently came under my tutelage so I

98
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,289
knew I had the opportunity to really get

99
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,969
a ear to the rails if you will

100
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,110
perspective of what the new developing

101
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,710
trader is doing with their time and this

102
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,129
is what they filled in now take a moment

103
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,900
and take in take all this in for every

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,529
block there's something recorded for

105
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,300
what they were doing at that specific

106
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,000
time and that duration of time

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,730
you can see the multitude is spent

108
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,260
between work and sleep and you also

109
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,790
notice there's a lot of time spent

110
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,930
watching television I'm going to state

111
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,270
this and it'll probably be debated

112
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,070
amongst you all if we were all in a room

113
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,640
it would be a great deal of agreement or

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,120
disagreement with what I'm gonna say and

115
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,370
I'm just giving you my opinion no you're

116
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,730
not

117
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,120
obviously held to that as a you have to

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
do this to succeed

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
there's the plenty of avenues and

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
approaches to doing trading or

121
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,940
developing as a trader that would lead

122
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,530
to success it doesn't have to come under

123
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:23,560
the wings of ICT but I felt inspired by

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,990
a few of the new students that just came

125
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,830
under the June enrollment and their

126
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,100
concern is is how are they to manage

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,640
their time to be efficient and still be

128
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,330
a active participant of their family and

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,510
I guess the best way to do that would be

130
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,729
to like I'm doing here

131
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,890
and I think all of my students

132
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,100
collectively both in the free mentorship

133
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,710
content areas of my forum and under the

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,669
private mentorship group those

135
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,320
individuals would I think benefit from a

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,590
study like this because it's a practical

137
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,190
it's not a get in here and buy here or

138
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,530
get in here and sell here you're worried

139
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,580
about what the charge of telling you

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,130
right now because if you don't master or

141
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,870
control what you're doing with your time

142
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,220
it doesn't matter what you're buying or

143
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,580
selling

144
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,550
you're gonna lose money you're gonna be

145
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,169
worrying about not being able to be

146
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,120
somewhere when you're supposed to be or

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,830
you're gonna be focusing on studying

148
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,830
things that aren't really something to

149
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,919
be concerned with at the moment so why

150
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
am I doing this particular study I want

151
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,320
every one going into this new week with

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,400
this in mind and I think that if you

153
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,380
submit to this exercise it'll be rather

154
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,860
illuminating for most of you you'll see

155
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,970
where you're spending the majority of

156
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,410
your time

157
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,040
and where you have opportunity where

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,710
most of the time I have folks say that I

159
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,750
have a lot of content there's a lot of

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,490
things to read there's a lot of things

161
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,700
to watch and a lot of things to study

162
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,830
where should I find the time or where

163
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,440
can I find the time I should say to do

164
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,350
all that and every one of us no matter

165
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,710
what you're doing you have time all you

166
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,200
need is one block out of all these

167
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,060
blocks here to represent a 24 hour span

168
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,030
of time you really only need one of them

169
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,730
now if you spend those 15 minutes with a

170
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,660
undisturbed focus really spending just a

171
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,650
small segment of your day number one

172
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,780
it's practical everyone has a life

173
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,930
everyone has a family everyone has

174
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,770
responsibilities some of us have jobs

175
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,840
some of us has businesses some of us

176
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,210
have job search because we're between

177
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,180
jobs so those things are real you have

178
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,490
to make time for them obviously but

179
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,380
there are still opportunities in every

180
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,960
24 hour period of time that everyone

181
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,160
could make time to learn how to do this

182
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,470
do you need a full hour every day no

183
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,320
absolutely not I think if there is an

184
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,410
ideal time representative of what I

185
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,790
think a normal progressive development

186
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,950
curve in terms of how much time per day

187
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,220
I think 30 minutes is Right anything

188
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,430
more than 30 minutes each day is number

189
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,840
one you're not going to retain the

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,790
things that you're looking at you're

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,300
entertaining yourself so no matter what

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,550
you're studying I think that the

193
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,020
workload of everyone's standard day work

194
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,900
family commuting to work commuting back

195
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,230
home from work eating you know doing all

196
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,290
those things and then digesting the TV

197
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,440
which i think is the worst way of

198
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
spending anybody's time because you're

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,570
being programmed you're programmed to

200
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,790
think the way they want you to think the

201
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,890
media is always doing some kind of

202
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,270
program a that's why it's called TV

203
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,160
programs so if you can find a way to be

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,910
honest don't

205
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,380
how to sugarcoat it no one's gonna see

206
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,540
this okay but I'm gonna give you a

207
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,070
template you look at the bottom of this

208
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,270
video in the description there'll be a

209
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,010
link and click on it's a PDF file and

210
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,490
it's a blank worksheet okay and they'll

211
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,960
give you the opportunity to fill in each

212
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,040
day what you did with your time for each

213
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,410
15-minute incremental segment of that

214
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,480
24-hour span Monday through Friday and

215
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:34,660
Saturday and Sunday 7200 7200 that's how

216
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,880
many minutes there are between Monday

217
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,670
and Friday every single person that has

218
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,110
a job a responsibility a family someone

219
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,920
that's depending on them is spending

220
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,500
those 7,200 hours

221
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,700
pining and working and slaving and

222
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,010
sacrificing those minutes for someone

223
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,180
else's benefit 72 minutes each week

224
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,150
Monday through Friday every one of us

225
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,650
has to spend those 7200 minutes doing

226
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,400
something now

227
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,590
for most of you there was 7200 minutes

228
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,300
are being spent sacrificing your time

229
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,960
for wages you're submitting yourself to

230
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,500
time in exchange for money you're going

231
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,050
to work to benefit someone else's

232
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,030
pockets fulfilling their dreams and

233
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,990
you're just making ends meet

234
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,430
and sometimes they're not meeting which

235
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,650
is reason why you're at a website or

236
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,390
channel like this one because you're

237
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,270
looking to someone else to help you make

238
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,360
those ends meet and find a way outside

239
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,420
of that rat-race 7200 minutes every week

240
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,750
Monday through Friday this is what the

241
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,480
generalized perspective is of the

242
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,340
student that submitted to this whole

243
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,030
process for me all we did was basically

244
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,080
did the same thing every single day he

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
has set things that they eat every

246
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,769
Monday every Tuesday every Wednesday

247
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,839
Thursday or Friday the things that are

248
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,689
being prepared for dinner or pretty much

249
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:26,589
predetermined it's a routine folks all

250
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,439
around the world have some measure of a

251
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:33,149
routine they go through the motions

252
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,549
you're gonna waste a lot of time if you

253
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,129
just go through the motions you're never

254
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,860
gonna leave the rat race if you're stuck

255
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,910
in this rut it's very easy for every one

256
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,199
of us to wake up go through the daily

257
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,259
grind of what's expected of us what's

258
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,139
being demanded of us and we put our

259
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,420
wants and our dreams and our desires

260
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,489
aside because it's distracting getting

261
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,670
away from what we have to do but just

262
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,899
like when you have to go to work you

263
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,269
have a set time you have to report to

264
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:12,819
work you have set break times

265
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,980
lunch maybe you have 15-minute breaks

266
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,480
around the 10 o'clock hour or the 2

267
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,759
o'clock hour but they're scheduled there

268
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,980
are times that are allotted for you to

269
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,490
be doing or not doing something and when

270
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,339
you subscribe to the idea of working for

271
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,799
a particular company or an employer you

272
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,970
are submitting to that time schedule now

273
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,089
outside of that schedule you have to be

274
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,410
a good steward with your time you have

275
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,420
to take those moments that are available

276
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,899
to you where they are elective the

277
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,240
things that you can do with your own

278
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,049
time now the problem with this own time

279
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:57,129
definition is some of us have family

280
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,569
some of us have children spouses we have

281
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,879
recreational team sports bowling leagues

282
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,869
pool leagues you have to go to your

283
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,549
lodge things of that nature they also

284
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:15,669
fall into their own category of allotted

285
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,579
time you're being expected to spend your

286
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,579
time at this function at this amount of

287
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,749
time for this duration of time then you

288
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:30,380
have wasted time what is wasted time

289
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,960
in my opinion and again this is simply

290
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,100
my perspective on it

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,140
I believe that sleep is a wasted amount

292
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,620
of time because you can get away with a

293
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,010
far more amount of time then most people

294
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,170
feel they have to have TV is an absolute

295
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,670
waste of time if you go through this

296
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,040
exercise and you fill in your blocks be

297
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,420
honest if you spend time watching

298
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,610
television record it as such if you have

299
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,440
your special programs that you have to

300
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,910
watch record it and be honest at the end

301
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,480
of the week when you go through all of

302
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,910
the things you've done you're gonna find

303
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,830
that you're spending again most of your

304
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,290
time sleeping and working for someone

305
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,800
else now you're looking at that sleep

306
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,670
time to rest so that way you're prepared

307
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,110
for the amount of time you spend for

308
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,190
work that work is what you submitted to

309
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,370
for an exchange of your time for wages

310
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm not saying that that's not required

311
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,280
because most most of us really you have

312
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,070
to have some employment to some degree

313
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,540
okay either you're running your own

314
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,940
company or you're submitting your time

315
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,050
for someone else bottom line is you're

316
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,050
doing it okay and if you have thought

317
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,020
about trading for a living you're really

318
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,260
trying to earn a job you're trying to

319
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,800
learn to earn from a job that you make

320
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,970
your own schedule for but it's still a

321
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,930
job you still have to perform to eat so

322
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,410
if you don't have that in the forefront

323
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,200
of your mind okay cuz a lot of students

324
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,230
come to me with this fairy tale in mind

325
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,660
that it's gonna be magical and it's not

326
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,250
magical and many times it's a lot more

327
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,000
work because you are the one in control

328
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,340
but you start that control with this

329
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,770
time management if you don't identify

330
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,110
where you're wasting your time

331
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,940
you got viously you're not gonna have

332
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,770
any time to devote to development and

333
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,060
study all you're looking for is 150

334
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,650
and block one to start and then

335
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,230
gradually grow into a 30 minute saying a

336
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,450
time for study just because I have a

337
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,850
video that may be an hour long doesn't

338
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,530
mean you have to sit and digest the

339
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,620
entire thing you have to be a good

340
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,300
steward of your time you to spend your

341
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,660
time efficiently spending it in such a

342
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,610
way where the time that you're spending

343
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,880
with the information not only are you

344
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,380
digesting the information but you're

345
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,540
also retaining it because if you're not

346
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,060
retaining it what good is it it's of no

347
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,170
use to you some of you are zoning out

348
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,510
right now thinking this is not a video

349
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,320
for you and that's fine but I'm speaking

350
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,450
to the ones that are really taking this

351
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,290
development cycle serious because if

352
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,850
you're going to invest your time in

353
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,430
yourself it's well it's practical and

354
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,070
responsible for you as the person

355
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,030
seeking to make a positive change to be

356
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,950
sober-minded

357
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,210
about what you're doing with the most

358
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,450
valuable thing in existence to you it's

359
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,910
not money it's not your family it's time

360
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,370
because without time you can't make

361
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,820
money and you can't spend time with your

362
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,220
family think about it the most important

363
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,260
valuable commodity that every one of us

364
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,380
have and not enough of it is time this

365
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,420
individual spends his Monday through

366
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,090
Friday doing this very routine day in

367
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,090
and day out they want to escape this my

368
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,950
question to this particular student was

369
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,110
are they willing to give up all that TV

370
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,930
time because if you take one of those

371
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,870
rows of TV out and replace it with

372
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,160
exercise you'll you'll need and you'll

373
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,540
find that you need far less sleep for

374
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,330
someone that doesn't exercise actively

375
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,340
that they exercise they're gonna think

376
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,110
that they need more sleep time because

377
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,970
they're gonna be more tired the opposite

378
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,330
is true because the sleep that you end

379
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,960
up taking on after you exercise is much

380
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,230
more beneficial to you so the time that

381
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,179
you're asleep your body does all of its

382
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,850
repairs it gets adequate amount at rest

383
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,309
and you can get up and do your name

384
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,820
normal day to day grind you do not need

385
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,970
eight hours of sleep I had one student

386
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,230
come to me and say oh you know I have to

387
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,429
have ten hours of sleep or I just can't

388
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,480
function I asked if the exercises and

389
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,840
the answer was no and what's their diet

390
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,000
McDonald's and Burger King okay you're

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,010
poisoning your body and you're not

392
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,590
exercising it so you're going to feel

393
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,690
like you need more sleep because you're

394
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,029
not fueling your body with the proper

395
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,090
amount of exercise stretching

396
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,620
flexibility these are all things that

397
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,750
should be scheduled into your day now

398
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,370
for some of you that have a work

399
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,070
schedule that may be very close to what

400
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,750
you're saying here you're probably

401
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,299
thinking this is know has nothing to do

402
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,330
with trading but it does it absolutely

403
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,059
does because if you are not in the

404
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,210
proper state of mind with a healthy body

405
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,580
that's well rested but not over rested

406
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,710
and you're budgeting your time

407
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,230
efficiently number one you're not gonna

408
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,789
be distracted in your study time because

409
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:20,669
your son needs to go to that soccer

410
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,909
practice or your wife needs to spend

411
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,760
that amount of time with you and go to

412
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,019
dinner or you have to have that doctor

413
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,480
visit with your your pet you have to

414
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,529
have all these things allotted for now

415
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,360
just because there are a lot of four and

416
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,669
you plan for them it doesn't mean that

417
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,260
it's always gonna fit inside those

418
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,419
little perfect 15-minute blocks

419
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,799
sometimes it eats into another block

420
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,059
sometimes you can finish things although

421
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,080
earlier I want you to use the blocks as

422
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,779
the closest representation of that

423
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,440
amount of time in 15-minute increments

424
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,730
if you do it and you're honest part two

425
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,860
of this series I'm going to teach

426
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,059
how you can use the time more

427
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,780
efficiently and what I think is a

428
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,910
realistic developmental curve for new

429
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,200
students then what's what's a new

430
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,120
student someone that's been with me in

431
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,670
less than one year okay cuz the first

432
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,410
year you're gonna dabble you're gonna

433
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,720
look at videos and gonna daydream about

434
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
well I could do this and do that and

435
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
you're gonna look at something like do

436
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,500
want a video Papa a Fibonacci and draw

437
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,390
or X I'm a rectangle or something on the

438
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,790
on the chart and you're play around how

439
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,770
to figure out what I've been doing or

440
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,350
your demo trade to see what would happen

441
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,480
and you're wasting time your first year

442
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,220
with me you just don't know what you're

443
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,040
doing once you get to the degree of

444
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,080
seriousness that's required and it's

445
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,600
usually about a year you get tired of

446
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,309
looking at everybody else's stuff and

447
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,549
you see things in mind that keep popping

448
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:01,400
up in your charts because of hooky with

449
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,940
very generic things that are transparent

450
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,400
price action you can see it things that

451
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,809
take place in the London session you've

452
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,809
seen those things well those learning

453
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,580
sessions they operate on a schedule but

454
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,220
just because that schedule is blocked

455
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,770
out for a specific amount of time that

456
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,230
we call one an open doesn't mean that

457
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,820
you have to be there the entire loan in

458
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,610
open session when you have that 7200

459
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,390
minutes in front of you the motivation

460
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,390
is you're doing everything will know

461
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,660
7,200 minutes to spend your twenty eight

462
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,440
eighty two thousand eight hundred and

463
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,530
eighty minutes that's what everyone

464
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,330
works for Monday through Friday not to

465
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,450
do this they want to take those two

466
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,740
thousand eight hundred eighty minutes

467
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,330
and spend it with something like this

468
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,640
the students submitted to me what their

469
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,960
Saturday and Sunday generally is

470
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,720
comprised of as you can see the play

471
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,140
time majority and it's sleep

472
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,980
a couple commutes to and fro some family

473
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,590
time but notice how much family time in

474
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,470
comparison to sleep and play play is

475
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,320
their time doing their own thing now

476
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,740
that could be representative of going

477
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,770
out and having drinks it could be out

478
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,320
dancing it could be you know doing

479
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,330
whatever adults do with their own time I

480
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,059
didn't ask for the specifics okay but it

481
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,809
was apart from family okay so the

482
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,590
commutes to and fro they recorded it the

483
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,320
time they took that get prepared

484
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,570
dressing showering and such all those

485
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,929
types of things are being recorded here

486
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:04,880
but notice how Saturday and Sunday are

487
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,610
almost perfectly the same in fact they

488
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,100
are the same if you look at it so

489
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,049
they're doing the same things on

490
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,090
Saturday and Sunday they made time

491
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,770
obviously for an app that appears

492
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,850
towards the middle the the afternoon it

493
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,820
looks like it's a preparation for their

494
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,210
night ahead now this doesn't seem like

495
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,309
someone that is going to be well rested

496
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,240
for the Monday grind because you have

497
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,100
all that play time they've been wasting

498
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,500
they could have been resting now doesn't

499
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,100
mean sleeping it could be doing things

500
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,669
allowing the body to prepare to unwind

501
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:55,080
how many times have you spent your

502
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,610
weekend where you should be resting

503
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,280
enjoying the time away from work you

504
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,110
feel like you need another weekend just

505
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,340
to get prepared for Monday that's not

506
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,850
because you've worked hard it's because

507
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,840
you have not allowed yourself to

508
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,790
discharge which is one of those things

509
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,890
that you have to learn to do that means

510
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,570
not doing anything that's gonna

511
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,210
stimulate you psychologically not gonna

512
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,090
stimulate you physically you have to

513
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,130
have a period of time to rest that means

514
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,980
do not

515
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,350
sitting still doing nothing stagnant it

516
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,620
just means you are doing very little to

517
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,179
overexert yourself mentally

518
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,070
psychologically emotionally or

519
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,049
physically so you have to have some

520
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,590
period of time to just relax and be

521
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,779
settled you have to schedule that now

522
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,720
some of you probably aren't Christians

523
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,130
and don't believe in the Bible that's

524
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,500
fine I'm not here to preach but it's

525
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,360
taught in the word that we should have

526
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,549
one day of rest I know that's not you by

527
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:05,309
chance it's it's proper actually if you

528
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:07,889
have a day where you just relax and

529
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:11,010
spend time resting doing very little

530
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,940
work

531
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,610
don't try to exert yourself don't put

532
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,309
too many time demands on your day

533
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,659
most people subscribe to the view that

534
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,039
sunday is the right thing it doesn't

535
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,460
have to be Sunday but if you have a job

536
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,380
Saturday or Sunday is a good day to do

537
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,440
it but I don't think that it should be

538
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
one or the other but there should be a

539
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,529
day where you have no Chuck no chart

540
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,710
time no reading time about the markets

541
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,590
you need to be completely segregated

542
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,130
from it no ICT videos no looking on

543
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,690
Twitter no none of those types of things

544
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,450
and you need to be apart from it because

545
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,769
most of my inspiration have come by way

546
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,539
of times where I've been away from all

547
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,169
of you been away from my private

548
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:01,230
mentorship students and didn't look at

549
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,000
charts didn't look at you know Twitter

550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,139
myself no social media and I get ideas

551
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:11,760
about teaching or a specific solution to

552
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,029
some students sticking point will come

553
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,340
to me you know I'm not actively looking

554
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,090
for it just jumps in my head I would be

555
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,899
distracted if I did not have my time

556
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:28,559
allotted for rest now rest is again is

557
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,049
not sleep I do a lot of meditation I do

558
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,299
a lot of stretching and to me I think

559
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,809
those are my two best times outside of

560
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,570
Bible study but if you look at the

561
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,570
periods of time that you wait

562
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,500
doing things that you really don't

563
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,820
benefit from and no one else has

564
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,710
anything from either they are just

565
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,880
consuming your time what are you looking

566
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,210
forward to this coming weekend where

567
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,159
your 2880 minutes are gonna be devoured

568
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,130
by what are you gonna do is it a

569
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,799
particular sporting event is it a bar

570
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:14,340
scene is it a recreational venture with

571
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,169
the family are you going away is it a

572
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:16,830
vacation

573
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,409
is it a extended weekend type thing

574
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:23,429
whatever it is that's gonna be in your

575
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,029
mind Monday through Friday you know

576
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:28,200
every time you feel like you want to

577
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,620
walk out of your job and quit those

578
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,440
things are gonna pop up as a deterrent

579
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,419
well just like you've done for your job

580
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,269
because you hate it well I shouldn't say

581
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:40,919
there are some people that follow me

582
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,139
that love their job even though they can

583
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,610
imagine themselves being profitable as a

584
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,139
trader they don't want to leave it and

585
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:48,629
it's great but trust me it's a minority

586
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:52,529
group they're the motivational factors

587
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,970
and rigidness to discipline of sticking

588
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,159
to that grind of going to work for very

589
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,289
little in exchange for your time for

590
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:04,440
money you have constantly built

591
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,600
reminders of why you have to keep going

592
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,029
back there that torture okay comes with

593
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:17,279
it by way of a reward in sense of it's a

594
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,529
wage and it pays for the things that

595
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,700
feed your family you have to down

596
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,460
associate that same measure of

597
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,240
importance to your study when you

598
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,629
schedule your 15-minute walk you have to

599
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:37,080
submit to that do it in over a period of

600
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,690
time how much time it's all dependable

601
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,070
and when you can make more time and when

602
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,990
you feel inspired to do so but I don't

603
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,460
think more than 30 minutes a day is

604
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,039
asking too much of anyone and I think

605
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,179
anything more than 30 minutes when

606
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,950
you're new it's just really bloody

607
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,260
wasting time okay so when you watch a

608
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,710
video for me it shouldn't be viewed as

609
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,520
you know sitcom

610
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,230
entertainment don't don't look at like

611
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,340
that put in 30 minutes

612
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,180
get what you can get out of the 30

613
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,740
minutes and turn the video off if you

614
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,030
got to come back to it to die you die

615
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,820
just the rest of it then do so but I

616
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,480
think that the worst thing new students

617
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,180
do is try to plow in and watch every

618
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,090
entire video in every series and think

619
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,430
that themselves that they now know what

620
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm talking about and that's the reason

621
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,630
why people struggle because there's too

622
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,140
many things to learn too many things to

623
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,180
learn and you're trying to cram it all

624
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,160
in like someone that went through school

625
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,670
all all the entire semester you didn't

626
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,620
pay attention to the teacher at all but

627
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,970
the night before the test you're trying

628
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,250
to cram and it never works out and

629
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,250
that's the same type of effect that new

630
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,320
students do they go in they they're

631
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,030
fascinated they see things they learn

632
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,180
things and they can you know more or

633
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,910
less relate to the things I'm saying but

634
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:59,430
they over exert themselves and allow too

635
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,110
much information in one time it's like

636
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,990
drinking from a firehose and you can't

637
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,360
do it okay I'm not saying I'm a mental

638
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,710
giant I'm not saying you're not mentally

639
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,050
adequate to do it I'm just being

640
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,770
realistic

641
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,430
there's too many things for you to

642
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,380
properly digest and retain with the

643
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,180
information and this is actually going

644
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,490
to the mentorship students as well just

645
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,050
because you have access to the entire

646
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,570
month's content doesn't mean that you

647
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,740
should just plow through it all in one

648
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,540
weekend because you're not going to

649
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,340
retain it you're absolutely not going to

650
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,100
retain it you should go through at your

651
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,800
own pace but you should do it in a sober

652
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
minded approach don't try to do too many

653
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,620
things because it'll be just like this

654
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,210
here play play play play play and that

655
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,430
doesn't mean play an ICT video just

656
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,350
because you have more time away from

657
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,210
your work doesn't mean gorge yourself

658
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,240
with ICT content because you're not

659
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,850
going to grow from that you just watch a

660
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,090
video spend about 30 minutes to that you

661
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,120
know in terms of time and then spend

662
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,990
your time elsewhere

663
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,650
trust me while you're working and when

664
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,930
you break times and you commute times

665
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,490
you'll spend time thinking about it

666
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,160
you'll be motivated because you have

667
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,920
scheduled the amount of time - 15 or 30

668
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,930
minutes of study time each day but

669
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,100
you're found saying well this is gonna

670
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,600
make it harder and longer for me to get

671
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,570
better at it no it's not it's absolutely

672
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,940
not you're going to keep the intended

673
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,060
motivational level and inspiration in

674
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,780
your development such as a new student

675
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,820
by limiting how much time you spend with

676
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,490
it the time you spend with it will be

677
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,790
much more enrichment it'll be much more

678
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,890
engaging and you'll find that you're

679
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,650
retaining more and it's not overwhelming

680
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,750
you don't have to rush at this and I

681
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,370
can't say it enough to say it so many

682
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,180
times but people think I'm just I'm

683
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,650
speaking in the sense that it's

684
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,390
counterproductive for them but I have

685
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,840
done this with thousands of people

686
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,400
thousands of people and I'm telling you

687
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,440
the ones that always gorge themselves

688
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,710
with the content they never get it any

689
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,168
faster in fact they're the ones that

690
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:16,800
email me saying I'm struggling or I just

691
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,870
can't get it I watch all these videos i

692
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,460
watch it from the time I get up and I'm

693
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,550
telling them you're doing too much but

694
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,230
they won't listen they think I'm trying

695
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,570
to keep something from them it's not

696
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,070
what I'm doing I'm actually trying to

697
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,649
help you but you're not listening so if

698
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,149
you have a coach if you have a mentor

699
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,850
and they're trying to teach you listen

700
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,280
this is one of the best ways for you to

701
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,899
improve in everything your time

702
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,139
management I get asked a lot of times

703
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,270
what is it that keeps me going I'm

704
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,280
always apparently awake I'm always

705
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,760
always online to some degree everyone

706
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,710
asks you do I ever sleep and I sleep I

707
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,170
sleep in increments of four hours and

708
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,430
then I do two hours in naps and I

709
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,500
schedule them and it's not a set

710
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,690
schedule my say my sleep schedule

711
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,890
rotates and I start my day when I wake

712
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,200
up from my four hour sleep schedule

713
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
whenever that is for that particular day

714
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,450
I schedule it and I do everything around

715
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,130
that four hours if I'm gonna be doing

716
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,300
any kind of trading if I'm gonna be

717
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,190
doing any kind of errands

718
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,750
spending my time with my family if I'm

719
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,700
spending time with my children if I have

720
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,010
to take my kids somewhere or if I have

721
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,609
to take my dogs to that or anything like

722
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:35,490
that I plan it outside of that four-hour

723
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,599
block of sleep and then I do two sets of

724
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,240
napping I don't do a block of two hours

725
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,329
I do like a 1 hour nap and then maybe

726
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,490
I'll catnap in two cycles of 30 minutes

727
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,250
but it's throughout the day because I

728
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,609
don't have a job I can place sleep where

729
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,770
I can schedule sleep I don't need to

730
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,810
have eight hours of sleep in fact if I

731
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,000
ever have a four hour a full night of

732
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,339
normal sleep that everyone else requires

733
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,730
I would feel sick because it's too much

734
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,849
sleep so I'm not advocating for you all

735
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,770
to go to work on four hours sleep that's

736
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,000
not what I'm suggesting here I'm the

737
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,210
saying that I get asked that a lot and I

738
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,430
use a four hour sleep schedule and I

739
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,339
don't feel really rundown at all unless

740
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,980
I do a whole lot and I do like 24 hour

741
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,520
or 36 hour runs with teaching and things

742
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,730
and preparing things which I've done and

743
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,460
it's not healthy to do on a regular

744
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,210
basis but I don't feel that it's hurting

745
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,420
me because it's not always happening but

746
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,680
I don't require a lot of sleep that's my

747
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,160
point

748
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,020
okay and when you get to the point where

749
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,210
you no longer have to work and you can

750
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,910
do this on your own you're gonna find it

751
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,020
you don't need that much sleep either

752
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,660
because I'm not stressing about things

753
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,420
that normal people are stressing about

754
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,470
don't worry if it's stressed as I have

755
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,869
is if my wife wants me to do something

756
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:00,569
I'm gonna be able to do everything else

757
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,770
I have to do outside of what she

758
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,619
requires of me or my children okay so I

759
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,540
have all those same problems that you

760
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,000
experience yourself but I have the

761
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,770
freedom to plan all my other stuff

762
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,869
around it whereas your job gets in your

763
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:18,780
way you have to be again a good steward

764
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,050
of your time and by doing so you're

765
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,819
gonna find at your days far less

766
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:26,430
stressful because you've made time for

767
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,770
things and you're also going to filter

768
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,890
out the things that waste your time see

769
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,210
you're gonna be surprised once you go

770
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,890
through this and you record everything

771
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,990
out what your

772
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,760
doing what your time is in terrible a

773
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,160
terrible amount of time being wasted see

774
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,170
you'll look back maybe before you let

775
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,160
your head down on your pillow or make

776
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,240
you free close your eyes and go to sleep

777
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,360
and you'll think you know I didn't think

778
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
I did anything today I feel like I've

779
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,360
wasted today you know that's probably

780
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,020
true

781
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,760
ninety-nine percent of time it's gonna

782
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,410
be something that everyone would agree

783
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,540
on if they were to go through the entire

784
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,000
process of looking at what you did with

785
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,030
your day but when you live your life

786
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,720
like this and you plan out those things

787
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,990
that make you an efficient productive

788
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,510
person you're gonna filter out the

789
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,430
things that waste your time you're going

790
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,320
to focus your time and energy and

791
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,770
efforts more economical and efficiently

792
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,619
when they're in front of you you're

793
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,050
gonna know what those things are by

794
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,820
their measure of importance and priority

795
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,640
obviously wages and earnings is going to

796
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,920
be top of the list then it's family time

797
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,190
and then sleep you know some of you

798
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,990
it'll probably be work sleep and then

799
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,960
family or in other groups that are more

800
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,359
selfish you'll think that it's sleep

801
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,869
work I'll get there when I get there and

802
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:47,369
then you're in recreational time and

803
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,820
family comes the distant last so I'm not

804
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,590
judging anyone here I'm just stating

805
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,560
that I think that if you go through this

806
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,310
exercise this week run down each

807
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,340
individual day and fill in the blocks

808
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,710
and you'll see at the end of the week

809
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,900
and do the weekend to Saturday and

810
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,109
Sunday I'll do a part two to this and

811
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:14,340
show you how a development cycle could

812
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,470
be done and still have all the

813
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,020
requirements of normal sleep go to work

814
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,359
do all your normal things okay so I'm

815
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,730
actually using someone behind the scenes

816
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,440
there's a real person behind all this

817
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,859
so the the insights I'm sharing with

818
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,430
this individual is being basically

819
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,080
shared openly known obviously for

820
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,640
privacy sake I can't say it's this

821
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,560
person or that person and if they want

822
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,090
to say on Twitter it's them and that's

823
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,369
you go right ahead but I'm not doing

824
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:41,670
that

825
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,369
because I have privacy requirements

826
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,340
being expected of me as you know it's a

827
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,990
business owner so

828
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,290
just know that there is a benefit to

829
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,450
doing this and it absolutely has a

830
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,520
bearing on your success as a developing

831
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,830
trader because if you don't do these

832
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,480
things you're gonna waste your time

833
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,150
you're gonna be emotional about things

834
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,560
why why would you be emotional because

835
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,030
you didn't get the things you needed

836
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,970
done notice what happens when you sit

837
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,290
down with your demo account right now

838
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,520
and you have your job you have your

839
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,070
family when you're mad and you're

840
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,780
fighting with your family members or

841
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,640
you're fighting about something at work

842
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
and you're angry your work first thing

843
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,280
you do when you get home is put on a

844
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,310
demo trade think about it go back to the

845
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,850
videos I started with 2010 average Joe

846
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,900
needs some kind of release okay you will

847
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,780
not feel those impulses if you get

848
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,990
control of your time see that's what

849
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,210
you're fearing you're going nuts right

850
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,800
now because you're running out of it

851
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,940
every single day you're losing time now

852
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,140
the beginning of wisdom is to count the

853
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,580
number of your days and I agree with

854
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,630
that but you have time today's not

855
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,190
promised and tomorrow's not promised to

856
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,210
anyone but you still have to occupy you

857
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,060
have to do what you have to do what is

858
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,619
it yet to do you got to get control of

859
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:03,240
things what's the thing you can control

860
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,480
your time that's the only thing you can

861
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,310
control you can't control the markets

862
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,330
you can't control how your spouse is

863
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:09,990
gonna react

864
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,609
you can't control what your spout your

865
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:13,800
your spouse's employer there's another

866
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,859
factor that you may be a catalyst for

867
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,810
your inspiration that leads a rat race

868
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,560
because you you need to wages and that

869
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,650
spouse is getting harassed or overworked

870
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,510
and not appreciated not compensated

871
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:31,109
enough maybe you're not trying to lose

872
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,820
your job right away maybe you're just

873
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,560
trying to replace your spouse's job and

874
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,890
that's a pressure on you all these

875
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,080
things are things that's going to

876
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,660
motivate you do the wrong thing because

877
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,250
you're being emotional about it

878
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,710
why because you're running out of time

879
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,550
time is what you're afraid of you're not

880
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,140
afraid of losing money no one's afraid

881
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,970
of losing money that's not what you're

882
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,609
afraid of you're not afraid of failure

883
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:02,430
either you're afraid of your

884
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm being wasted some of you probably I

885
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,990
turn this video off because you saw

886
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,359
don't waste your time some of you are

887
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,829
getting ready to hit that button to turn

888
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,780
it off guess you thought it was a waste

889
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,130
of your time it has nothing to do with

890
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,800
trading but it does it absolutely does

891
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
the best trading books out there would

892
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,609
talk about this if they knew what they

893
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,819
were doing the traders that call

894
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:26,970
themselves authors and educators if they

895
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,760
understood this element they would teach

896
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,130
it I'm trying to do that for you I'm

897
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,930
trying to highlight the thing that is

898
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,170
the biggest barrier to development in

899
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,880
anything not just trading anything is

900
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,650
mismanagement of time I have a highly

901
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,329
routine and disciplined approach to time

902
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:51,900
management

903
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,410
I don't always meet my time windows

904
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,290
because things could pop up but for the

905
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,630
most part I get more things done in one

906
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,660
day than the average person would ever

907
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,599
remotely consider doing at all because I

908
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,599
live my life like this everything's a

909
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,829
15-minute block of time to me and I

910
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:15,930
visualize my next 24 hours to 48 hours

911
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,910
in this manner I schedule my sleep with

912
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,619
the things that have to be anchored to a

913
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,500
specific time and then I put my sleep

914
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,799
and me time in between all those things

915
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,299
now you can't do that because you have a

916
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,790
job and I understand that you have

917
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,380
responsibilities but you still have time

918
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,480
to devote to learning this craft but you

919
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,730
have to be a good steward with your time

920
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,250
and you got to be responsible with it

921
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,119
filter out the things that are gonna be

922
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,640
a distraction focus on the things you

923
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,599
have to do at the time

924
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,130
what's the task at hand what am I

925
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,069
expected to do right now and do that and

926
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:56,549
I promise you if you do these things you

927
00:43:56,549 --> 00:44:01,530
will have much more enthusiasm much more

928
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,940
energy because you won't be stressing

929
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,500
stress is a very

930
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,730
big burn on calories it's a big

931
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,460
impediment to your health and it's

932
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,000
routed to time everyone wants to have

933
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,849
more time you can't get any more than 24

934
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:24,430
hours have a day you can't but you can

935
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,339
more efficiently run your time in this

936
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:30,220
24 hours you don't need a lot of sleep

937
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,260
as much as you may think you do you

938
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,490
don't you sleep many times more because

939
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,020
you don't want to be awake during the

940
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,270
stressful hours people that are propped

941
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,710
up by their own enthusiasm and

942
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,770
motivation don't want to sleep because

943
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,430
it's wasted time when you're depressed

944
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,270
you have anxiety those things will make

945
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,849
you sleepy maybe you're depressed that's

946
00:44:57,849 --> 00:44:58,869
the reason why you have in the feel that

947
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:01,060
desire to sleep more than you need but

948
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,099
generally it's because of exercise the

949
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:06,700
lack thereof and poor nutrition because

950
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,099
if you live your life principally

951
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,069
oriented on doing things in a positive

952
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,640
light that means caring about yourself

953
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,920
being motivated to stay healthy rest

954
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,650
properly not over rest and be

955
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,560
disciplined about your time you will not

956
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,500
worry about time and it by taking that

957
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,750
big barrier up you know being successful

958
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,359
and making it an ally because right now

959
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,180
you think time is and its adversary it's

960
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,670
not an adversary it's a resource that

961
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,490
you have plenty of you have more time

962
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,310
than you need but you have to allow

963
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,010
yourself time to develop and don't rush

964
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:54,609
it 2880 minutes is your weekend now this

965
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:56,859
I think is time where you can devote a

966
00:45:56,859 --> 00:45:58,630
little bit more than at 15 or 30 minute

967
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,970
period but throughout the Monday through

968
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,030
Friday timescale nothing more than 30

969
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,650
minutes I think is needed on the weekend

970
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,079
no more than 2 hours 2 hours is

971
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,400
sufficient amount of time to be

972
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,730
developed me devoting to divulging into

973
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,980
the ICT libraries or any other

974
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,600
kilo doesn't have this have to be mine

975
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,570
it could be anything but two hours I

976
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,320
think is about right because again

977
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,180
anything more than that you're not gonna

978
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,880
retain it it's like that two hour-long

979
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,220
mini mini series movies that people are

980
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,560
putting out sometimes your attention

981
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,630
span is just like I want to smoothie to

982
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,740
end kind of like what you're feeling

983
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,180
right now at this video come on get to

984
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,440
the end of it two hours on the weekend

985
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,220
each day 15 minutes to start Monday

986
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,280
through Friday or 30 minutes at maximum

987
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,650
Monday through Friday you have to have a

988
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,200
balance and you have enough when your

989
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,359
plate Monday through Friday with work

990
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,480
and family and your normal date of a

991
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,090
daily routine to squeeze ICT in there

992
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,450
any more than that everyone has to

993
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,770
submit to this to some degree in the

994
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:16,250
beginning but your goal is in through

995
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,330
all this you need to find a way to

996
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:26,990
perceive time like this all you need is

997
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,180
one block in any one of those specific

998
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,750
elements of time in a 24-hour period one

999
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,630
day per week think about that now

1000
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,160
you have Monday through Friday in front

1001
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,890
of you to do very very well

1002
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,330
you only need one 15-minute block out of

1003
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:56,530
one day at this entire week to do well

1004
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,960
part two we'll talk about how you can do

1005
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,900
that until then I want you have a very

1006
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,690
productive week don't try to do anything

1007
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,210
else out of your normal routine record

1008
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,700

1009
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,050
test in the description below in this

video click on that PDF file print it

1011
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,510

Monday through Sunday and I'll have

1013
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,990
another video on next Monday night part

1014

2 of this series and I'll talk about how

1015
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,650
you can do more productive things with

1016
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,359
your time and the minimum that's

1017
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,100
required to get maximum effort

1018
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,120
have small requirements of time until

00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,860
