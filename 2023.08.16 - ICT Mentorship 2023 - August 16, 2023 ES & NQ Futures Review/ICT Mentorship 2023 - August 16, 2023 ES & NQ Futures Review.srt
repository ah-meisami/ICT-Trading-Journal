1
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,780
welcome back folks

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,619
just a quick little review here

3
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,140
the left hand chart is the s p Futures

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,300
Contract the daily chart and the right

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,320
hand is the NASDAQ daily chart

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,359
you can see here we did in fact

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,660
run outside of the imbalance we did in

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,239
fact trade up into a due to swing and

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,520
trade lower look at last night's review

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,780
and you'll hear that that's what we're

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,940
looking for we wanted to see a measure

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,739
of movement to the upside which sets up

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,440
a due to swing okay so the context is

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
when we're looking for daily bias

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,760
is we're looking for a weekly drawn

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,840
liquidity

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,280
the frame a buy or sell program

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,640
then individually each day we're waiting

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,199
for a power 3D

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,180
materialize in this case we've been

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,939
bearish on s p and NASDAQ that means the

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,740
open is going to be near the high and

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,060
anything above the opening price would

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,920
be viewed as a judo swing

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,939
a fake rally to entice traders to chase

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,040
that going long and then aggressively

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,320
trading lower we have sell side resting

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,580
in here

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,280
for the s p and over here on the NASDAQ

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,619
we had

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,340
similar

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,380
delivery and price we have the open the

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,840
due to swing moving higher above the

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
opening price and then moving lower sell

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,340
side liquidity resting below here

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,439
all right hourly chart here and Lefty

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
inside s p

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
we mentioned this uh in passing last

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,619
night we had

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,939
to buy some balance outside of

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,159
efficiency worked up into the top of

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,799
that range and broke lower I told you

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,079
exactly where this shaded area is here

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,880
we ended up revisiting that again today

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,820
so it kind of like framed the daily High

46
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,140
so the market teared up into that

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,240
inefficiency

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,038
broke lower

49
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,020
shift in Market structure

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,879
rallies back up

51
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,640
we have a fair value Gap in here and

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,379
then look at all the

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,959
movement beyond that but the bodies are

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,959
very close to that shaded area now this

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,220
is one of the signatures I was referring

56
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,620
to last night about August August tends

57
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,319
to be a little bit more

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,739
money in in the sense that it's not as

59
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,080
clean as you would expect to see

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,099
in other months of the year

61
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,720
there's a small little inefficiency rate

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,280
in here in the form of a fair value Gap

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
and or

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,940
civi so you can mark that on your chart

65
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,200
says I'm going to try to keep this area

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
clean as we work through the time frames

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,220
and then at the time of the recording

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,860
here we're looking at the next cell

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,560
cycle which is enclosed proximity to

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,519
where we are at the time of this

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,680
recording

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
my right hand side NASDAQ okay we traded

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,300
up into consequent encroachment on the

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,440
15th

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,239
broke lower

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,580
consequent encouragement of this city

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,840
here

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,400
order block

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
consequent encroachment of the bicep

80
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
balance on efficiency around the hourly

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,300
chart then we have a fair value Gap here

82
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,340
look at the bodies

83
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,280
okay this is today's price action extend

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,599
that forward

85
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,159
okay this is not your classic support

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,440
and resistance to the fellows that like

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,180
to show up in my comment sections and

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,560
talk about how this is nothing but

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
support and resistance well if it is

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,860
just support and resistance and it's

91
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,379
this this easy I would love for you to

92
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,000
do these things in advance and call it

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,620
before it happens too but something

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,120
tells me it's just it's not going to

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,940
happen but the inefficiency here plus

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,060
the Wix doing the damage trading up into

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,620
the inefficiency the bearish order block

98
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,440
here but the bodies telling the

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,860
narrative meaning that this imbalance

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
now we have a balanced price range we go

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,040
up

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,819
down up down half consequent

103
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,019
encroachment

104
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,299
we leave it

105
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,099
hits it like a brick wall

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,840
sells off we have a fair value Gap

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,180
consequent encroachment of this Wick and

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,839
tilt closed candles lots of indications

109
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,660
at that two o'clock fomc minutes

110
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,580
expecting that to be a wonderful

111
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,220
sell-off and then gravitating towards

112
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,680
that 14 853 and a half

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,360
that's our expectations going forward

114
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,860
15 minute time frame left hand side s p

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,600
you can see we did in fact straight up

116
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
into that shaded area as I mentioned

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,620
last night took you into exactly where

118
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,060
that occurs

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,400
and then price broke lower we have a

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
shift in Market structure so this

121
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
movement right here this is model 2022

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,580
okay so the mentorship model that I

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,500
taught in the year 2022 on my YouTube

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,380
channel here this is the exact model

125
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,600
being delivered here

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,660
in the afternoon during fomc minutes

127
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,880
in the market accelerates the downside

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
taking out the 4424 level that I

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,860
mentioned on YouTube NASDAQ on the right

130
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,900
hand side here's our imbalance or fair

131
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,979
value guide and the Monday 10 A.M

132
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,199
60 Minute bicep and balance outside

133
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,720
efficiency high and respective low

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,759
that's what these levels are here we

135
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,860
trade it up into that lots of Confluence

136
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,500
in here okay lots of Confluence and

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,479
again the market shares displacement to

138
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,620
the downside

139
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,020
shift in Market structure here

140
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,180
two fair value gaps just like over here

141
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,240
here and here you make allowance for

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,340
price to trade up into the second one

143
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
here we see it I see a curve so we have

144
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,660
the inefficiency here and then this one

145
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,300
here so during fomc minutes we trade up

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,039
into it here for a 15 minute cell sign

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720
balance by side efficiency

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,419
consequent encroachment here for the gap

149
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,900
then aggressive sell-off institutional

150
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,039
overflow entry drill which is a move

151
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,160
just above this candle High there and

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,320
sells off and then again looking for

153
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,699
fourteen thousand eight fifty three and

154
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,740
a half

155
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,479
finally moving into a five minute chart

156
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,220
you can see here this is our afternoon

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,400
PM session which I was sleeping through

158
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,280
the Silver Bullet so we can see it trade

159
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,720
up into here

160
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,180
and aggressively move lower attacking

161
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,160
that 4424

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,740
and and similar vein here and you don't

163
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,560
see the the inefficiency so much on the

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,259
five minute once we drop down from 15 to

165
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,139
5 but having this higher time frame PD

166
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,660
arrays on your charts are very important

167
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,580
otherwise you'll lose yourself in the

168
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,080
candlesticks and it's important not to

169
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
get lost in price delivery

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
so we see it straight up into here

171
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,319
breaks lower look at the bodies forming

172
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,819
inside of the Monday 9 30 a.m low

173
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,100
and the Sunday 11 50 p.m low those two

174
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
cell cycle according poles I mentioned

175
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,360
this morning at the start of the trading

176
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,080
day

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,639
and

178
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,520
all of this movement here at 9 30. all

179
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,580
of this was a Juda swing okay so for the

180
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,100
guys that like to comment when I post on

181
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,380
Twitter when I'll say princess when an

182
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,259
objective is reached okay I'll put like

183
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,020
something to the effect like a boom or

184
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,819
there it is or something that affected

185
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,139
me to draw some kind of emotional

186
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,539
stimuli around it so that way it's

187
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,800
meaningful to you that way you'll go

188
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,539
into your journal or your charts and

189
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,360
you'll refer to that as a milestone in

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,620
your observation because you watch

191
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,720
something outline in advance then

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,979
deliver

193
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,419
so

194
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,400
obviously people that say those things

195
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,759
that say oh well it only went up you

196
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,479
know

197
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,020
so many handles before going down there

198
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,419
well it didn't really go up

199
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,580
you know a hundred handles

200
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,060
and higher it went up to go to levels

201
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,460
that I had outlined last night listen to

202
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,740
the outline and Analysis I gave you last

203
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,080
night we were looking for a move higher

204
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,120
first okay so if you're a student of

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
mine you know this is the case when

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
we're looking for daily bias and we're

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,120
bearish we wait for initial delivery

208
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,740
that's opposing

209
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,780
that means it's against it's not in the

210
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,039
same direction of where we want to see

211
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,380
the market go to so initially we want to

212
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,539
see some kind of false movement in the

213
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,220
opposite direction that does not scare

214
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,259
us that doesn't make us second guess our

215
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,879
analysis this means that that's exactly

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,319
what we're looking for

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,940
and there's a lot of retail traders that

218
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,259
thought that these markets and these

219
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,660
levels up here were going to go higher

220
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,400
and it just simply was not going to do

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,199
so because everything I shared with you

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,440
last night before the fact and then

223
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
without stealing the Thunder from the

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,219
tweets because I actually called out all

225
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,719
the key turning points and where we're

226
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,839
going to draw to throughout the morning

227
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,040
and then we actually get it here so

228
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,540
it's important for you to follow me on

229
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,740
Twitter if you don't follow me at least

230
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,720
go and check it out look at tweets and

231
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,779
go and pull them up and plot them on

232
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,640
your trading view chart okay you can

233
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,160
just do a copy of the individual tweets

234
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,240
that I send

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
when I'm referring to specific levels

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
and that way you can right click your

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,279
mouse button over top of a chart and

238
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,959
then click paste in the actual tweet

239
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,000
that I make a comment about

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,740
will be attached

241
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,200
to the very Candlestick at the time that

242
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
I made the tweet and then you can judge

243
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,980
whether or not there was any visibility

244
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,019
there or not but you have to take the

245
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,339
entire

246
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,500
understanding and observation and

247
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,060
Analysis that was given to you last

248
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,500
night we were looking for lower prices

249
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,019
we were looking for where the NASDAQ

250
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,959
traded to today we are looking for where

251
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,839
the s p traded to today

252
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,000
it's undeniable folks these things are

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,980
transferable you can learn how to do it

254
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,420
but you have to do these types of things

255
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,680
every single day to condition your

256
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,480
understanding and activate your

257
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
particular activating system where it

258
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,120
allows you to see these things that

259
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,060
you've been hunting for and you build in

260
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,420
importance you build an affinity towards

261
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,820
these things that we're annotating the

262
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
chart by journaling them and as a result

263
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,660
the default function of you seeing these

264
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,040
things in hindsight and then

265
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
anticipating them studying them with a

266
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
tape reading environment that means not

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,080
trading it in a demo that means not

268
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,700
trading it with a funded account

269
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,140
challenge not trying to trade it with

270
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,620
live funds just simply relaxing and

271
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,320
letting the understanding build over

272
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,060
time not be in a rush to try to make

273
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,820
money you can't speed that part up but

274
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,279
the way that becomes easier is for you

275
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,080
to go through this part of your growth

276
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,440
which is the longest part

277
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
and it's going to be longer than you

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,380
want it to be

279
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,839
but if you submit to it you'll get these

280
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,279
things you'll understand what it is that

281
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,320
you're expected to see in price and

282
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,420
everything that I'm teaching you is

283
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,100
linked to time

284
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,500
every price run is linked to a Time

285
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,420
delivery mechanism

286
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,240
nothing's random nothing's just oh look

287
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,339
at this unless

288
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,579
unless something happens on a

289
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,760
geopolitical or a warfront where you

290
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,480
know

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,519
it's something that would be completely

292
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,899
unexpected

293
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,399
and then they would not waste that

294
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,440
opportunity either

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,300
so if we found this one insightful and

296
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,760
so I'll talk to you tomorrow

297
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,300
be safe
