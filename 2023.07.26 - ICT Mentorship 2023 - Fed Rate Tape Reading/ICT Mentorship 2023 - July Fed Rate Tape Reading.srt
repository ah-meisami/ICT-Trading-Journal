sorry for my tardiness

5
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,540
OBS was acting up so hopefully they

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,739
won't

7
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,320
cause any more issues

studying live

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,660
I'm sorry I have to put these types of

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,739
things in here because a lot of people

13
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,780
out there don't take my

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,480
video and upload it to their social

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
media and pretend it's them and

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,399
you know in the business

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,920
all right so we're

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,899
gotta check Twitter and make sure you

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,640
guys can hear me if you are a follower

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,260
of my Twitter account

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,360
uh just give me a five by five if you

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
can hear me and if the chart is on

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
NASDAQ

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,939
September contract 15 minute

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,739
I just saw my tweet saying it's a

26
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,140
60-second uh lag

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,520
not sure why

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,700
I have set to the lowest one so

29
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,920
not that it really matters because you

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,720
should be treating this today

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,160
I just saw my tweet

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,700
yeah there's a bit of a like isn't it

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,019
I'm gonna send you a picture that way

34
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
you can see I do in fact have it set to

35
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,860
the lowest latency

36
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,340
I know there's a lot of folks out there

37
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,480
that like to

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,700
make excuses for this that new thing

39
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,860
with here's your here's your proof that

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,080
it's set to the lowest ultra low latency

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,540
but for whatever reason it's

42
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,220
getting there

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,420
slowly today so

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,340
it's not for a lack of trying I promise

45
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,560
you so anyway

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,879
let's get over here to the chart

47
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,099
make sure my phone's set to do not

48
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,780
disturb

49
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,519
ERS like that

50
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,420
try to call me

51
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
all right so here is the NASDAQ 15

52
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,780
minute time frame

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
and I'm going to go up to a daily just

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,200
for a second

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,360


57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
and then it meanders around 2 30 it

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
starts at the real move okay so it's not

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,180
always like that there's some times

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,120
where it'll move and then move even more

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,680
in the same direction

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,040
in other instances but very much more

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
rare is where there'll be an initial

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180
move at two o'clock and then it just

65
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,440
consolidates after a bunch of little

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,120
whipsaw movement at 2 30. so that's why

67
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
it's very important that you understand

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,720
that anything that I comment today

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,120
please don't use it as a like a secret

70
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,560
handshake that I'm trying to tell you to

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,180
buy or sell because if that's not what

72
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
we're doing here today but I want you to

73
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
observe how the market reaches for

74
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,600
liquidity how it behaves afterwards and

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,979
if this is the first time you ever

76
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,440
watched something like this live it'll

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
be

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
probably very obvious why you shouldn't

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,340
try to trade ahead of it

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,139
I will toggle back and forth between

81
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,960

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,539
I know some of you don't have access to

83
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,720
those markets you have to trade the cfds

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,320
um

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,020
for my focus and for brevity's sake I'm

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,460
gonna Focus here

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,460
everything that you would see in the

88
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,840
hindsight later on

89
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,759
compare and contrast the charts that way

90
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,740
you can see how both

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,900
delivered on the

92
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,699
the basis of this

93
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,360
event at two o'clock and then 2 30.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,860
all right so we have liquidity here

95
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,020
we've already hit the liquidity this one

96
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,539
you watch me do an execution on that

97
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,180
there are relative equal highs here

98
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,380
that is a lot to get back up to but you

99
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,639
know stranger things have happened on

100
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,919
days like this so I want to go right

101
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,780
into the 15 minute time frame

102

[Music]

103
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,460
and I mentioned this morning that the

104
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,500
640 level was too clean

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,800
right in here and that's that's what I

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
would like to see happen

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,039
doesn't mean that's what I think is

108
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,240
going to happen and it's going to

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,919
therefore be a trade idea for you to

110
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,360
take no

111
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,160
I might get it wrong

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
um just like a CPI you've watched me do

113
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,120
I think two times

114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,340
where I've talked about CPI number ahead

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,240
of time what I thought was going to

116
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,259
happen and it was completely

117
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,780
diametrically opposed after the news hit

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,280
the marketplace and it just rolled

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,780
aggressively the other direction which

120
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,120
is again that's a that's a freight train

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,139
you don't want to stay in front of it

122
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,000
this is like a gambling

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,620
uh it's a gambling session you don't

124
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,639
know where it's going to go I don't know

125
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,840
where it's going to go

126
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
and the fact that you're not going to be

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,660
able to get in and get out because

128
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,240
broker's pool of liquidity so it's not

129
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,039
an absence of wanting to be a buyer or

130
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,800
seller it just means that they are doing

131
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,539
their best to try to protect themselves

132
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:13,500
because

133
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,120
a lot of you out there

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,639
you get heavy-handed with your bets and

135
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,039
sometimes you can get real lucky

136
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,660
and they don't they don't want to expose

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,639
themselves to that type of risk

138
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,840
all right so just 30 seconds to go and

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,340
then we'll see the first stage of

140
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,940
the FED event today

141
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,819
so the two reactive points is 15 640 and

142
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,220
fifteen thousand four eighty three those

143
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,840
are the two price points I'm monitoring

144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,340
and what I want to see

145
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,319
is how they react after trading to

146
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,940
either one and I don't care really which

147
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,259
one it goes to because I'm not pushing

148
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,180
the button but I want you to see how

149
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,960
fast it moves

150
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,000
instead of

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,520
the two o'clock which is here so that

152
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
means this this here

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,458
and then I would look for it to run to

154
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,799
that level and then best case scenario

155
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,479
would be run for that 640 which was my

156
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,860
interest this morning on Twitter

157
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,320
if it would have ran

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,399
and it still could but it runs for the

159
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
15640 level then I would look for at 2

160
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,019
30 does it show a willingness to reject

161
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,660
that entire move and run for the lows

162
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,040
here and maybe gravitate towards this

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,839
not that it wants to go here or would

164
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,060
likely go there we just are looking for

165
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,620
a range to trade

166
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,779
and an opinion

167
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,600
okay we're trying to ascertain the most

168
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
likely draw on liquidity and right now

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
it's indecisive it's not really giving

170
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,380
us a whole lot to work with at least

171
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,220
it's not for me

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I like the fact that we went up

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,720
into this self-center balance by side

174
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,839
and efficiency we overlapped this volume

175
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,839
and balance of two separated bodies here

176
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,180
if it rejects all this and runs lower

177
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,740
than that scenario that I'm looking for

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,500
at 230 might still be in contention but

179
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,959
right now there's simply not enough

180
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,860
the girl one

181
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,959
I can imagine some of you that are

182
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,000
relatively new maybe you're used to

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,860
watching Instagram guys talk about stuff

184
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,800
that didn't happen

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,839
um and you're wondering why well why

186
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,700
don't you trade in this why you know why

187
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,959
wouldn't you want to be a part of this

188
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,760
it's going to be a big mover

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
um the likelihood of you getting a good

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
feel number one is unlikely two the

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,300
risks far outweigh the potential reward

192
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,800
you can easily hurt yourself

193
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,220
and I've done that to myself on days

194
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,019
like this trying to be

195
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,779
a cowboy over leveraging and trying to

196
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,880
do things that thick feeling you know

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,320
you think okay well it should have

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,880
stopped me out and it just keeps rolling

199
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
way past your stop loss that's the risks

200
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
and that's that's all part of that cfdc

201
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,680
required disclaimer that people that

202
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,360
talk about the marketplace people that

203
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,620
uh yeah cell services or give signals or

204
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,779
just even comment about the market if

205
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,220
you read those disclaimers it talks

206
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,260
about these very scenarios where there

207
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,820
may not be an opportunity for you to get

208
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,240
a fill

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,680
and it's not good when you're in a trade

210
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,420
and it's going against you there's

211
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,339
nothing that you can do to fix it or

212
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,940
remedy it

213
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,079
okay so I like the idea that we've taken

214
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,940
these relative equal lows out here

215
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,140
you sweat the rejection block here if

216
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,060
you look at the closing price on that

217
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,040
candle

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,899
that's this up here upper left hand

219
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,320
corner

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,019
that closing price comes in at fifteen

221
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,000
thousand five thirty five and three

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,560
quarters

223
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,399
and the low

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,079
one handle less

225
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,940
so we went below that

226
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,040
it's staged off any lower prices

227
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,320
initially here

228
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm gonna see do we treat this here

229
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,899
as a breaker so I'm going to be watching

230
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,459
this

231
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,740
right in here this is so sensitivity and

232
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,839
want to trade Above This high right

233
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,420
there if it does that then we want to

234
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,760
measure how much animation how much

235
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,339
energy how much

236
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,959
interest

237
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,540
does price want to show towards going

238
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,680
into that 640 level

239
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,019
now the worst case scenario if we don't

240
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,820
break this High here and we don't break

241
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,480
this low and it's like 215.

242
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,940
eight more minutes or so then the real

243
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,040
move is going to be 230 and it's going

244
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
to be a freight train and who knows

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,700
where it's going to go so that's why

246
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,019
it's important that you understand that

247
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,200
this event is two stages and it's

248
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,320
imperative that you can at least try to

249
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
figure out what the initial run was and

250
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,579
right here it's

251
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,000
it's either or it's 50 50. so 50 50 is

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
not a scenario that I want to go out

253
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
there and push a button on I don't even

254
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,000
want to give you a bias on that because

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,820
it's not clear so one of the things that

256
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,260
my students that have been with me a

257
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
long time

258
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,720
they know that I know what I'm looking

259
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,160
for when it's there I'm going to try

260
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,959
them all over like white on rice but if

261
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
it's not I'm sitting still

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,820
and you have to be comfortable with that

263
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,560
and it's a skill set that you should be

264
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,839
trying to acquire knowing when to sit

265
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
still knowing that okay the price might

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
move around it might move a lot but if

267
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,519
you are not in it that's not a losing

268
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
trade

269
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
but to a neophyte so when it's new

270
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,820
someone has just got into this industry

271
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,980
or watched other people that may not be

272
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,620
actually doing anything

273
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,480
their advice or their opinion about

274
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,339
something or showing maybe fraudulent

275
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,779
results

276
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,320
you might subscribe to their views on

277
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
you should be trading on a day like this

278
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,079
or she you should already be in a

279
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,540
position already and I I'm not

280
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,339
a proponent that I don't I don't like

281
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,200
that I think that it's

282
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
irresponsible

283
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,560
and it Fosters the

284
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,019
the wrong mindset about managing risk

285
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,700
which is what this whole industry is

286
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,560
about it's not about making money it's

287
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,940
about making sure it's that high

288
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,139
want to see speed Above This high right

289
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,320
here

290
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,519
usually when I'm doing an execution this

291
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,279
is when I'll type in I want to see large

292
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,459
up close candles or large green candles

293
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,740
incoming something to that effect once

294
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,779
we get into this area here

295
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,480
the reason why is because I suspect that

296
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,579
this area here is going to be used as a

297
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,440
kind of like Rocket Fuel that's that's

298
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,899
what I would kind of reach for in terms

299
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,300
of an analogy they're going to use this

300
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,579
area here to really speed up and run to

301
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,399
15 640. that would be my understanding

302
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,100
and my expectation but

303
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,060
if it fails to do that very thing there

304
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,440
that means we're going to probably hang

305
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
around inside the range between the

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
height forms here and the low here until

307
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,920
we get to 230 which is not helpful

308
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,740
now you might say well you know

309
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,600
what's the point of all this

310
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,579
and a new student or a new Trader would

311
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,079
think that you know what's the point of

312
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,639
all this if you're going to watch this

313
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,980
and not do anything well I'm teaching

314
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,079
students that have never done this

315
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,000
before or they don't have a skill set

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
where they can trust how to read price

317
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,420
action what is it you're looking for ICT

318
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
what what Garners your interest in a

319
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,480
specific price run to a high or low or

320
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
buy side or sell side what would negate

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
a specific idea that you made like

322
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,579
initially but what cancels it what what

323
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,399
makes it uh null and void that's what

324
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm teaching you and that stuff is not

325
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,199
transferable knowledge in a book

326
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,720
okay so the things that I'm not going to

327
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
be able to include in my books I'm

328
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,339
teaching you in live market settings

329
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,899
whether it be through tweets calling the

330
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,240
market or doing live sessions

331
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,720
or doing things over recorded execution

332
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,940
and explaining to why I'm doing what I'm

333
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,500
doing and not other things

334
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,480
now what I'm looking at here

335
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,880
my interest is let me let me get this

336
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,019
Shameless advertising you like that

337
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:16,800
um

338
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,920
this range right there that that sibi

339
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,740
I'm cutting through all of this and my

340
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,779
eyes going right into here I don't want

341
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,600
to see any respect

342
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,060
of this Range High

343
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,920
so this should be a balanced price range

344
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,380
not in an event where we're reaching for

345
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,420
liquidity and it's also an unsettling

346
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,519
which is

347
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,079
the whole premise behind read

348
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,940
announcements the same reason that they

349
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,560
would use CPI number same reason why

350
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,959
they would do non-farm payroll

351
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,240
okay it's a disrupter it's a

352
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,240
it's very

353
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,800
point of existence is to disrupt

354
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,679
the existing order flow

355
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,839
that means that everybody that's been

356
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,419
going lower this morning that's been

357
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,919
profiting

358
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,260
their stop losses are above relative

359
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,839
equal highs or short-term highs so

360
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,140
that's a buy side level quality pool

361
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,119
I'm not interested

362
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,699
in seeing this as a balanced price range

363
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,260
because my my

364
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,000
interest is up here

365
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,740
I think that these individuals think

366
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,299
that they're safe

367
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,799
and I always look at the marketplace

368
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,140
with that mindset you know who who has

369
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,280
been making money

370
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,919
where would they be scared what would

371
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,480
make them scared and what would take

372
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,580
them out of the marketplace and why

373
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,120
would their stop loss be taken be

374
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
helpful to someone else

375
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,260
and that's narrative okay that's that's

376
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,100
things that help them the trader form

377
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,020
and develop an idea about why the market

378
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,880
should even go where you think it may go

379
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,100
you can't just look at Price action on

380
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,380
the basis of a pattern

381
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,900
or a Fibonacci Ratio or something

382
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,200
harmonic or anything and you can't look

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,460
at a depth of Market just because

384
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,500
there's a number of orders around a

385
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,200
specific you know high or low level

386
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,059
relative to the current market price

387
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,000
that's not enough to just you know I

388
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
mean like it is enough for somebody to

389
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,620
form an opinion based on that but that's

390
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,559
to me it's too myopic it's limited in

391
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,780
its

392
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,640
underlying basis so there has to be more

393
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,100
to why the market should go higher not

394
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,080
just simply even for my stuff you know

395
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,220
just because there's a down closed

396
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,500
candle and the market has you know

397
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,620
shifted above a short-term high and it

398
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,539
came back down to that down close candle

399
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,320
unless the narrative is suggesting

400
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,360
that the Market's going to go to some

401
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,720
buy side liquidity pool or some premium

402
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,179
inefficiency above the market price

403
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,520
that's not going to work

404
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,620
and that's what I see a lot of by

405
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,000
individuals out there trying to teach

406
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,620
over block Theory because

407
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,600
they think it's supply and demand so

408
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,100
they're taking the

409
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,280
the facts that just because there may be

410
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,559
a rectangle on my chart or I'm drawing a

411
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,260
special attention to a specific candle

412
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
um they will add in that they'll go

413
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,820
through candles because that's what

414
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,740
supply and demand says that you're not

415
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,820
supposed to do that you're supposed to

416
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,679
look at a fresh Zone

417
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,539
um

418
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,299
there has to be some underlying reason

419
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,200
for the market to go to either reprice

420
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
to inefficiency above or below the

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
marketplace

422
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,780
or trade to stops above or below the

423
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,799
marketplace

424
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,360
they're the only two things that can

425
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,580
happen or it consolidates that's it

426
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
anything outside of that is manipulation

427
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,980
it's manual intervention these days like

428
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,320
non-farm payroll today the FED

429
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
announcement you know whether you're

430
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,380
going to raise interest rates or lower

431
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,840
them or leave them unchanged you don't

432
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,460
know what they're going to do

433
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,900
there's people out there that already

434
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,299
know what they're going to make public

435
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,740
but even

436
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,419
but I'm not going to stick my neck out

437
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,559
there on the Block

438
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,240
in front of these types of events

439
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,480
because I know what their Tendencies are

440
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,660
which is they're traps

441
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,960
they can entice you to do something that

442
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,880
if you came into the market like I have

443
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,760
I have no bias except for the scenarios

444
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,740
I've painted for you here

445
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,380
so it's limited to two ranges of

446
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,919
liquidity the 640

447
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,120
and the 43.

448
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,460
and I'm not convinced one way or the

449
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,220
other because we haven't overrun

450
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,220
this here I'm not subscribing that this

451
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,660
is a balanced price range either because

452
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,140
the reasons why is because we have a

453
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,700
looming

454
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,440
conference

455
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,740
where the jaw boning by the FED will

456
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,620
need to be behind us

457
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,600
and then the market will be permitted to

458
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,740
move around

459
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,480
but right now what's actually occurring

460
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,280
at this very moment is everyone that's

461
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
in in an interesting party in trying to

462
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
trade this asset

463
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,539
they're trying to determine whether it's

464
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,039
going to go higher or lower and they're

465
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,539
they're placing bets right now they're

466
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,020
entering they're buying and selling

467
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,299
and they're going to have a great deal

468
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,679
of regret here

469
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,660
you come three o'clock

470
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,980
they're gonna wish they didn't push the

471
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,480
button in they're going to wish they

472
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,280
just turned off the charts didn't do

473
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,900
anything today

474
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,520
because it's going to do probably very

475
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,539
much

476
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,360
opposite to what they were expecting

477
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,159
and the unfortunate thing is if you're

478
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,620
inexperienced and you get into a move

479
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,240
and it starts to run in your favor on a

480
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,299
day like this you marry the vein

481
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,919
meaning you fall in love when you marry

482
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,299
that position

483
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,900
and you will ignore every warning sign

484
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,820
that it's either run its course it's

485
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,700
done or it's about the reverse on you

486
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,919
because greed you'll see it move really

487
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,620
really fast and if you're on side

488
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,159
in the initial stages of a price run

489
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,620
it makes you feel like wow it's going to

490
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,919
really go it's gonna really really run

491
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,780
and you won't and it didn't happen

492
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,820
and they'll tell you that you should be

493
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,919
in here trying to trade on these days

494
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,659
and that to me is the sure sign that

495
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,340
they are absolutely not risking real

496
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,780
money and they are absolutely not in

497
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,940
position to give anybody advice with

498
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,419
trading or financial advice

499
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,059
so I try to be very responsible as a as

500
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,220
a mentor as an influencer

501
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,440
and I want my influence to end come

502
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
November so I know things are going to

503
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,080
get wild here globally and I I don't

504
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,480
want to have any reason to feel like

505
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,179
I've either inspired or

506
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,559
um

507
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,299
let someone down

508
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,520
you know an incorrect perception of

509
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,440
where price would go when it starts

510
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,980
getting nuts

511
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,159
I will be Trading but I won't be doing

512
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,900
things like this come November

513
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,539
the YouTube channel

514
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,480
content will remain out there my Twitter

515
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,340
account will remain up I have never

516
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,440
deleted deleted any tweets

517
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,299
everything will remain I just I won't be

518
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,679
active

519
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,659
my attention we've diverted to my

520
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,280
personal life and my family and I'm

521
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,640
Trading

522
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,980
so we are about

523
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,100
um six and a half minutes

524
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,580
away from the real move

525
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,200
and that's really what we're here for I

526
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,720
just like to have the opportunity to sit

527
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
down with you you calm me down because

528
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm not a lot of people hopped up on

529
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,580
goofball you're like man he's doing a

530
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,380
live stream I'm going to take his advice

531
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,700
and whatever he talks about I'm going to

532
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,140
trade on that you shouldn't be doing

533
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,559
that today

534
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,600
so I've outlined what

535
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,720
interests I have in the marketplace

536
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,159
the buy side which I made noon and I

537
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,120
still right now with the market

538
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,159
structure that's in place at the very

539
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,620
moment we're looking at it right now

540
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,480
I still favor

541
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,179
a run for 640 if I was to have like a

542
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,799
gun to my head and say okay ICT right

543
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,780
now you call it what do you think is

544
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,679
going to happen

545
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,360
I believe that they're going to run for

546
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
6 40.

547
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,799
if I'm wrong

548
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,559
the only thing I lose is you know I

549
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,760
called a move that I would have never

550
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,220
taken with live money anyway

551
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,159
but based on the where I had to pay more

552
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,000
money for a better perspective

553
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,559
so I don't look at you know losing

554
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,940
trades like you know I lost my models

555
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,380
inferior now or it's obsolete too many

556
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,419
people to understand what the algorithm

557
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,919
is doing so now it's changing that

558
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,720
that's not going to happen more people

559
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,520
learning how to do this isn't going to

560
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,780
do anything except for create more

561
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,700
liquidity that's all it's going to do

562
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,120
there's gonna be a lot of people out

563
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,799
there that don't know what they're doing

564
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,360
like I was mentioning earlier down close

565
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,860
clinicals doesn't make it a bullish

566
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,280
order block

567
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,460
now where we're at here

568
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,860
I'm watching the Clinton encroachment

569
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,860
which is the midpoint of this Wick

570
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,659
right in here so

571
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,179
that right there I'm watching Dewey show

572
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,279
alone to expand a lot of momentum

573
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,080
running past that or is it just

574
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,580
fluttering around there and start

575
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,820
drawing back up into that candle

576
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,039
we're getting close to that 230 so

577
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,940
there's gonna be a lot of

578
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,179
whip song

579
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,220
I'm going to take this line off here

580
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,500
okay I don't want you to be confused and

581
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,120
it's also pissing me off because in my

582
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,679
way when I'm looking at everything so

583
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm going to take this line off because

584
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,960
it's already been used this morning

585
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,820
[Music]

586
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,220
and you can watch the live execution in

587
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,960
the

588
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,820
Twitter

589
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,860
feed posted this morning

590
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,360
okay you see how it just reacted off

591
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
that right there

592
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,000
that in itself on a 15 or 5 Second chart

593
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,580
that would be a trade I would have taken

594
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,200
on another day

595
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,179
not today on another day where there

596
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,580
isn't this looming big injection of

597
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,620
volatility but look how much it's pulled

598
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,000
off of that that's bigger than most of

599
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,740
the guys you've watched live stream

600
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,020
you know they're big moves it's not even

601
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,520
one quarter of that

602
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,539
and you just watched it happen just you

603
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,039
know one candle in one five minute

604
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,520
candle

605
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,600
so we're about a minute and a half

606
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,740
about

607
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,260
fundamental drivers controlling price on

608
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,120
the day of the event

609
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,580
I think it's a matter of who who can get

610
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,380
her easiest and here we're about to see

611
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,880
it begin in three seconds

612
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,640
[Music]

613
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,919
so this is the window time

614
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
that your focus should be

615
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,980
at the highest

616
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
not being distracted with your spouse

617
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
your children

618
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,779
mind your children by the way but uh you

619
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,940
know don't let your attention be diluted

620
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,520
because this is this is where the real

621
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,659
move will form

622
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,820
so we've had an initial run now if we

623
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,740
were looking at it like this so here's

624
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,159
two o'clock

625
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,220
right there okay so what is the much

626
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,140
more obvious run did it go down a lot or

627
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,260
did it go up and reach further for by

628
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,200
side than it did sell side

629
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,539
it looks to me like they set this run up

630
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,419
for the stops here

631
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,539
if everything is true based on what I've

632
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,779
seen in the past for a number of years

633
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:08,460
this should

634
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,740
a road below here and reach for this

635
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,260
down here that's what I would expect now

636
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,659
if everything goes

637
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,700
against what I just outlined it would

638
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,279
need to completely run entirely over top

639
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,840
of this

640
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,159
range here

641
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,140
if it does I would expect it to come

642
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,059
back down in and find that as support

643
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,760
and then it's going to go much higher

644
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,020
than this

645
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,700
that's what I would expect but right now

646
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,039
based on the fact that we waited till 2

647
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,260
30 it's 2 31 now

648
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,260
the Run was here so this is a much

649
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,539
larger run than just little drop down

650
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,860
here below here

651
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,260
so if it's a two-stage development and

652
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,020
delivery in price they ran for the

653
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,240
trailed buy stops

654
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,279
and I want to see does it show we're

655
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,320
willingness to get down below here and

656
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,200
if it does I'd be looking for the 483

657
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,520
level

658
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,559
what changes it what negates that idea

659
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,140
is it has to run over top of this all

660
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,059
this shaded area here and then come back

661
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,500
down and find some support if it does

662
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,020
then like I said it would be a much much

663
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,679
bullish much more bullish idea than I

664
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,120
would have expected you know at the

665
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,720
beginning of the day

666
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,140
and what you do he's uh he likes to talk

667
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,440
a lot

668
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,820
I don't know what he's saying I could

669
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,039
care less what he's saying

670
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,380
I don't have that attitude

671
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,559
you know follow along and make any

672
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,480
sense out of whatever that he's saying

673
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,679
because I think it's all

674
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,039
basically

675
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,960
it's not moving because he's talking

676
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,520
they're just using the fact that he's

677
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,980
talking it because he's a puppet and

678
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,440
he's the he's the focus Point okay he's

679
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,059
like the thing

680
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,880
he's the right hand of the magician and

681
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,380
you're watching him where the sleight of

682
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,659
hands being done on the left hand and

683
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,380
you never see it coming

684
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,940
I guess you shouldn't say never see it

685
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,120
come

686
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,120
foreign

687
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,700
payroll Fridays when I'm studying price

688
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,860
and or events like this

689
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,659
I like to put myself in a position where

690
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,200
if I was in a trade long or short you

691
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
know at what point

692
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,860
would I feel that

693
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,720
discomfort

694
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,480
and whether you're trading with a demo

695
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,940
in in the learning early stages of your

696
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,320
development or if you get to the point

697
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,899
where you're trading with real money

698
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,960
um

699
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,919
this is those days where guys will tweet

700
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,779
to me

701
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,179
let's say here's a trade I took

702
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,340
but they're not to tell me right now on

703
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,380
Twitter that they're doing it so if

704
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,520
you're going to do that if you have it

705
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,020
in mind

706
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,480
tell me right now

707
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,340
otherwise I'm not gonna pay any

708
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,240
attention to your tweets

709
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,380
[Music]

710
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,059
foreign

711
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,899
that looks good

712
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,500
let me see the down

713
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,460
okay so we have reached that sibby

714
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,840
now we're going to drop down until one

715
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,580
minute chart and study everything in

716
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,940
here okay

717
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,150
[Music]

718
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,840
now one of the setups that I like and it

719
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,100
may not form because it's a little bit

720
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,860
oh I might do it now when it trades to

721
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,140
here to top of that range and it opens

722
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,299
up the next candle it could trade down

723
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,039
and touch the high of that candle there

724
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,019
and then I would expect it to run really

725
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,299
fast up into the 640 buy side and expand

726
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,539
through

727
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,080
if it trades it at 640

728
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,299
or higher I would not be interested in

729
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,340
seeing this as support not that it can't

730
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,860
do it later on I just would not want and

731
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,000
it looks like we're going to rip through

732
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,179
it

733
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,640
now if it were to not do that I was

734
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,899
going to go up here and then come back

735
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,399
down I think that this is just a Target

736
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,679
and we're going to keep going into the

737
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,919
close

738
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,500
oh

739
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,080
and check is the

740
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,720
335 London session

741
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,180
by side just attacked I'd want to see a

742
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,580
little bit more run through than that

743
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,980
I'm seeing some tweets guys are saying

744
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,720
that it's buffering

745
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,000
and the audio's breaking up I can't do

746
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,560
anything about that folks

747
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,440
you know I I have high speed internet

748
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm not having any issues with my

749
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
delivery of

750
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,359
a signal

751
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm talking to you on a expensive

752
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,480
microphone like it's it's all YouTube so

753
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,560
I can't do anything about it

754
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,720
okay go back into this candle here I

755
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,099
mentioned when we were trading down I

756
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,839
want to see do we have

757
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,480
a willingness to hit that and reject it

758
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,460
it's consequent encouragement I'll show

759
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,839
you the actual measurements on that

760
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,859
[Music]

761
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,140
so the 50 level or consequent

762
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,820
encouragement of this tail on that

763
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,300
Candlestick comes in at 15

764
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,760
545 and three quarters

765
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,700
the low and you're going to look up here

766
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
upper left hand corner

767
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,960
the low on that candle

768
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,020
comes in at fifteen thousand five forty

769
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,500
five and a quarter so it went one half

770
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,680
of a point or two ticks

771
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,099
beyond that and then sharply rejected

772
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,660
root over top of this the only thing it

773
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,740
didn't really do that I would have

774
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,020
expected and would have enjoyed seeing

775
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,960
was on a one minute basis come back down

776
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,339
and touch

777
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,260
let me go down them on that chart

778
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,119
I would have liked to see it have

779
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,339
a touch of that right that level there

780
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,500
and then deliver like it's doing here

781
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,180
that would have been

782
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,619
a nice

783
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,880
60 points

784
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,060
so I'm looking at

785
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,740
the likelihood this will want to go

786
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,820
higher

787
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,980
into

788
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,700
not yet

789
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,099
traded Above This High here then I would

790
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,320
look at overnight London going into New

791
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,300
York and tomorrow's trading is this

792
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,660
would be the draw on trading tomorrow so

793
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,220
I would have a bullish bias going into

794
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,720
that and the only thing that would

795
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,960
change that is going below

796
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,180
this balanced price range that's on the

797
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,680
five minute chart

798
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,020
so that's what I do with this

799
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,760
information even though I'm not willing

800
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,619
to take the trade on a day like this

801
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:56,760
because

802
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,859
it's a big gamble and I'm more

803
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,300
interested in the information that it

804
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,040
provides me after it's already in price

805
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,980
because my interest is really on the

806
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,079
Thursday and Fridays action to trade

807
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:07,920
that

808
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,140
I use this information here to try to

809
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,980
like help me frame a bias

810
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,440
give me context as to what I would like

811
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,540
to show as a parameter in my analysis

812
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,760
where where would I be

813
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,220
Incorrect and assuming that it's going

814
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,740
to go higher or lower

815
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,859
that's why I study it even if I'm not

816
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,839
talking about it live on Twitter

817
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm always watching these big events and

818
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm looking at it with the same

819
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,060
perspective I'm showing you here today

820
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,740
where I'm measuring things I'm looking

821
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,359
at does it have a wellness that want to

822
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,460
go to a specific level does it do

823
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,380
certain things that I would like to see

824
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,300
or if it doesn't do that you know what

825
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,859
does that help me

826
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,900
you know conclude in terms of

827
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,760
useful information for tomorrow's

828
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,260
trading indoor Friday's Trading

829
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,980
and to a myopic new Trader or someone

830
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,339
that just starts or a inexperienced

831
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,020
Mentor they'll they'll be out here

832
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,220
trying to promote the idea that you

833
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,200
should have been a part of that move and

834
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,760
you might get lucky

835
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,740
you know you might you might be able to

836
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,599
do something with that

837
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,880
but if I'm in a position like I'm in and

838
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,339
if I say I'm gonna do something or I'm

839
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,599
interested in doing something I know

840
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,940
there's a at least 15 percent of you are

841
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,900
going to go out there and try to do

842
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,119
something with real money or your funded

843
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:24,960
account

844
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,520
and you're not going to know how to

845
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,200
navigate it you're going to not really

846
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,339
enter at the right time

847
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,540
and you're going to open up yourself to

848
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,460
a adverse result

849
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,440
and that's going to really get used but

850
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,839
I'm finding the right ones because it's

851
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,380
my stuff that's authorship but the

852
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,140
things that I'm teaching you to focus on

853
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,320
helps you frame narrative

854
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,180
why you should trust

855
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,339
these cons these Concepts at specific

856
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,160
times and not lean on them at others

857
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,140
when everybody else will look at it and

858
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,700
think it's a down close candle it's a

859
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,960
fair value Gap it's a trade it's

860
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,900
something to get into and it's not

861
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,560
so it's it's it's hidden in plain sight

862
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,480
that's the beauty of it and that's like

863
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,099
the easiest straightforward answer I can

864
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,540
give to people that are afraid that more

865
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,599
people will learn it

866
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,560
look

867
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,079
you know everybody that's ever rode a

868
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,280
motorcycle

869
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,660
it doesn't mean they're going to go out

870
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,640
there and keep up and run with those

871
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,020
individuals that can run around that

872
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,359
track you know like professionals speed

873
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,619
demons

874
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,000
and just because you drive your car

875
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,200
doesn't mean you could be a good NASCAR

876
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,460
driver

877
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,380
and it means that you're familiar with a

878
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,060
motorcycle if you if you're driven one

879
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
you're familiar with your car that

880
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,619
familiarity isn't going to be trans

881
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,880
verbal useful information to a Nascar or

882
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,099
a sport bike

883
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,619
you know

884
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,720
there's a big Chasm between someone

885
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,700
looking at a video or watching me talk

886
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,780
about something

887
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,180
and then actually going out and doing it

888
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,920
it's a great deal of learning that has

889
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,160
to take place and they will be a barrier

890
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,740
to themselves so I've

891
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,540
I've never been a

892
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,180
afraid of teaching it because more

893
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,140
people are going to learn how to do it

894
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,880
and it's going to change now I've been

895
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,040
afraid to teach what I know because I'm

896
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,839
not supposed to teach that

897
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,599
so I created this language to talk in

898
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,300
this language and this is where I'm safe

899
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,980
so I'm gonna hang around till about 3 15

900
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,180
then I want to close it

901
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,220

904
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,680
tell me that the video audio and such is

905
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,660
breaking up if you look at other people

00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,780
do we get any kind of

928
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,339
Insight from that

929
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:57,839
because I want to show some support

930
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,240
doesn't want to take out this swing High

931
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,560
here or does it just erode into that

932
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,839
going through this again to the downside

933
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:11,060
is very very very bearish

934
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,480
as long as we find support here

935
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,420
and it doesn't go through it

936
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,700
you take out this swing High here then

937
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,619
we would most likely try to gravity back

938
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,180
up in here

939
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,740
and we're on anybody that's trying to

940
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,099
sell short

941
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,760
he would need to do that though by 3 45

942
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,140
for me to like it

944
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,760
anything bullish we would not want to

945
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,540
see that at all

949
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,220
now 483 is

950
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:10,740
the draw for today

951
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,460
I'm going to close

952
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,680

953
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,140
up here you're interested in 640 this

954
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,700
morning a bit too smooth

956
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:31,380
money used that liquidity in the form of

957
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,420
buy side and they

958
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,720
are short where's their best exits

959
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,319
below

960
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,839
I'd like to see this area up here

961
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,119
stay open

962
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,740
I want to see if it's sensitive in here

963
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,180
and touching this

964
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,480
over here so this

965
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,980
if it wants this

967
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,520
I'm sorry 15 000 483 and three quarters

968
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,040
it wants that level going into close I

969
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,020
would want to see this shaded area here

970
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,700
treated as a balanced price range

971
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:22,559
yeah I measured this range here in the

972
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,079
event that we had to retrace up into it

973
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,900
anything at the 50 would have been good

974
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,660
or less for a short

975
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,460
it didn't even get up there so that to

976
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,680
me is indicative that it's

977
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,119
probably gonna be really neat going into

978
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,480
the clothes

980
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,240
into this

981
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,980
at least he got the short-term High

982
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,079
there and then reject and go lower and

983
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,180
aim for that fifteen thousand four

984
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,660
eighty three

985
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,220
if it doesn't even go back up into here

986
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,059
that's really weak

987
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,780

993
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,020
so I wouldn't want to see anything

994
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,400
on a closing basis

995
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,719
above the midpoint of that blue shaded

996
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,900
area

997
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,260
it's already spent too much time in this

998
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,159
area for my liking

999
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,300
we ran for one size of the liquidity I

1000
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,800
mentioned but I was

1001
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,020
interested in seeing that

1002
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,000
483 level give up the ghost

1003
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,739
that would have been both our fools of

1004
01:10:49,739 --> 01:10:52,940
liquidity swept

1005
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,199
35 minutes or so after three

1006
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,500
so now I'm determining

1007
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,900
what we'll run for on Market on closed

1008
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,320
macro

1009
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,860
I don't think we're gonna make a higher

1010
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,900
high

1011
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,060
and I don't want to see it trade above

1012
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,719
halfway of this shaded area here so

1013
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,940
either we consolidate

1014
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,800
which is yeah

1015
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,719
uneventful

1016
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,880
or we eventually come out of this

1017
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,679
aggressively and run for this sell side

01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,460
at the top of that range

I tell you don't trade these days

1041
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,780

to this range here

1045
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:34,380
just a really crummy uh

1046

momentum and movement around here today

hanging around

1050
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:51,120

tomorrow morning

1054
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,100
which will be a real nice heavy bias

1055
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,080
where I could see it wants to do this or

1056
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,480
that I want to close the video with this

1057
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,560
is what I'm going to be doing tomorrow

1058
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,360
so that way we can watch and see you

1059
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,640
know how I framed it on this

1060
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,440
and then use the executions and such

1061
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,840
tomorrow but

1062
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,280

1063
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,760
hat on yet

1064
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,460

all the steam out

1067
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,500

you guys are still Tweeting to me tell

1069
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:54,960
me there's something wrong with the

1070
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,719
audio keeps buffering and it's bad I

1071
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,560
can't do anything about that

1072
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,320
all right high-end equipment I'm using

1073
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,199
YouTube YouTubes doing whatever they got

1074
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:11,360
to do with it that comes to you

1075
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,920

1076
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,320
substandard manner that's not my doing

1077
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,219
them

1078
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:20,540
dealing with that kind of lion

1079
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,300
now let me close it with this

1080
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,100
what keeps me from trading on a date

1081
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,840
like this

1082
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,300
the things I pointed to here

1083
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,400
these are all things that I would expect

1084
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,719
to see

1085
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,360
in a market that's not being manipulated

1086
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,219
it's not being pushed around

1087
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:49,080
artificially

1088
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,780
so all this is intervention it's going

1089
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,659
Way Beyond what would be reasonable

1090
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:56,639
higher and lower

1091
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,880
so when I point out things okay the

1092
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,980
cynics will say see it doesn't work when

1093
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,120
the point is

1094
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,760
that days like this I've already arrived

1095
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,440
at and taught you that this is where

1096
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,840
you're going to see a

1097
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,440
of absence of precision otherwise it

1098
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,120
wouldn't I be out here trading it yes

1099
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,420
but I'm not this morning I did because

1100
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,800
there was something obvious right at the

1101
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,880
opening range

1102
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,260
but that's it

1103
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,120
the rest of the day I mean I would have

1104
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,159
I would have taken that

1105
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,500
and to run to here and then get up

1106
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,820
hopefully up in here my best case

1107
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,739
scenario exit would have been up here in

1108
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,960
a partial would have been at me that uh

1109
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,420
640 level even not 41 I would have been

1110
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,120
out 40 at partial and then my best case

1111
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,679
scenario here neither of which would

1112
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:42,120
have been filled and I would have had a

1113
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,620
stop out

1114
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:44,940
so

1115
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,440
it's not a matter of trying to save face

1116
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,780
here I'm not trying to you know paint

1117
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,219
something that would have wouldn't

1118
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:51,840
happened you know and to make myself

1119
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,060
look good the point is is I'm showing

1120
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,300
you where the problems lie on days like

1121
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:01,139
this so if you can identify it as a

1122
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:03,000
problem area where you're going to have

1123
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,040
friction you don't want to have a

1124
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,780
slippery slope it's already bad enough

1125
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,040
when you're first trying to learn how to

1126
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,840
do this you don't want to compound the

1127
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,699
difficulty with a day where even the guy

1128
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:13,380
that comes the things that I highlighted

1129
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,960
that I would like to see

1130
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,060
did materialize

1131
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:21,360
so if I'm telling you as the educator to

1132
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,100
Mentor the person that authored these

1133
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,920
Concepts if I tell you I don't trade on

1134
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,080
these days because my Concepts don't

1135
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,179
hold up well in this particular

1136
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:31,739
environment

1137
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:34,260
why should you go out there and gamble

1138
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,300
on

1139
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,460
the whole point is for you to understand

1140
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,719
that these days make it more complicated

1141
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,400
so when I point out things I want you to

1142
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,679
observe does it respect those levels

1143
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,199
does it do this does it do that no

1144
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,360
only a few things happened majority of

1145
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,980
it didn't

1146
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,020
so when we get to another rate

1147
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,300
announcement day in the future when I'm

1148
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,580
not doing this with you without showing

1149
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,199
you anything and you feel the impulse

1150
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,159
they want to go out here and try to

1151
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,100
gamble remember this because I'm not

1152
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,360
trying to do it

1153
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,940
so you shouldn't try to do it it doesn't

1154
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:12,480
matter who comes later on today and

1155
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,280
tells you what they did and how much

1156
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,659
they did this and this and that nothing

1157
01:28:15,659 --> 01:28:17,400
it doesn't matter you can't spend their

1158
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,179
money

1159
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:20,460
you can't spend their money and they're

1160
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,540
not going to give it to you because they

1161
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,639
made it so there's no point even talking

1162
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,040
about just know that this is a very very

1163
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,739
tricky day just like another on payroll

1164
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:30,060
day

1165
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,340
and the odds of you being successful in

1166
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,960
it are low

1167
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,460
so you don't want to be trading in those

1168
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,060
environments

1169
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,699
I would have liked to see this

1170
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,219
if you look at yesterday's afternoon

1171
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:50,219
price action I trade I was with my

1172
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:52,800
son Karen I was literally all over there

1173
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,739
I beat it up pretty bad

1174
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:57,900
and then later part of the day it did

1175
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,460
something very similar like it was doing

1176
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,739
here and what I was wanting was when I

1177
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:02,880
mentioned I said I want to see it trade

1178
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,620
up into this

1179
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,860
Gap here and I want to see it sell off

1180
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,960
and then reach for the sell side

1181
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,060
it did very much that very thing

1182
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,739
yesterday and I was waiting for a repeat

1183
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:15,719
scenario the very thing that we saw

1184
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:17,460
yesterday and what I was anticipating

1185
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,500
here came all the way up almost at the

1186
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,699
very high of it and it started to break

1187
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:22,500
down and what I was watching was does it

1188
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,320
have a willingness to get through

1189
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,500
this mean threshold the half point of

1190
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,480
this down close candle and it wasn't

1191
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,460
even able to do that so that was

1192
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,900
problematic and you watched me take away

1193
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,699
all the things here because I want to

1194
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:37,500
see does it gravitate back up to the

1195
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,840
midpoint of this because if it does I

1196
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,580
don't want to see it close above it this

1197
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,320
here looked good initially went down but

1198
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,659
then it this range started acting much

1199
01:29:45,659 --> 01:29:46,920
better

1200
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,560
you're trading on probabilities

1201
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,080
many times you're you're hanging it all

1202
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,520
on a myth

1203
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,380
some kind of animal pattern some kind of

1204
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,719
indicator

1205
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,880
and if I can't make Rhyme or Reason out

1206
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,100
of where they're going to draw too for

1207
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,360
inefficiency

1208
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,800
or liquidity

1209
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,080
whether it be premium or discount

1210
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,060
I'll be just like anybody else on a day

1211
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,080
like this

1212
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,880
struggling trying to find out where it's

1213
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,960
going to go because it's being

1214
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,699
controlled it's being

1215
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:18,480
outside the scope of normal Scripts

1216
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,340
and it just does these types of things

1217
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,500
here

1218
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,179
and you can sit here and wrestle like

1219
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:25,860
I've done for years when I was younger

1220
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,020
try to figure it out

1221
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,480
and I realized I don't need to do that I

1222
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,040
don't need to figure that day out I

1223
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,540
don't need to know what nylon payroll is

1224
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,400
going to do I don't care

1225
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,560
because I know I can find my models

1226
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,480
plural

1227
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,820
on all the other days

1228
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,340
of every single month

1229
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,020
and I also know there's certain times of

1230
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,639
the year where seasonal Tendencies are

1231
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:49,980
going to be more prone to

1232
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,679
deliver price in a much more magnificent

1233
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:56,520
manner a lot of speed a lot of distance

1234
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,440
the magnitude of the moves will be much

1235
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:01,040
more pronounced

1236
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,719
and I try to focus on those because I

1237
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:05,219
know that's where my Edge is that's

1238
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:07,139
where my advantages are that's where my

1239
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:10,260
models shine and the least amount of

1240
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,120
manipulation takes place so you don't

1241
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,620
want to have

1242
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,260
the biggest defensive team go up against

1243
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:19,440
your trades and you're asking

1244
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,620
to play in the

1245
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,000
the Super Bowl

1246
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,219
with the with the team that has the best

1247
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:27,600
defense

1248
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,060
on a day that your quarterback has an

1249
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,580
injury that's what it's like trading on

1250
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:34,679
these days no matter what you have as a

1251
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:37,380
model whatever whatever you use you're

1252
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,659
up against the individuals that roll

1253
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:42,199
this place

1254
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:47,340
and there's no better way of me

1255
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,139
communicating to

1256
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:51,360
than to sit out here live and explain to

1257
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,820
you what I personally would expect

1258
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,679
on a day that I would not expect my

1259
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,199
tools to to shine

1260
01:31:58,199 --> 01:31:59,820
if this is your first live stream here

1261
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,080
you're gonna hear that and say well this

1262
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,420
is someone trying to say face no you

1263
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,400
don't know what I've said before and my

1264
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,080
students will vouch for this I've always

1265
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,659
said don't try to trade on these days

1266
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:12,000
don't try to do it because Precision

1267
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,320
will evade you

1268
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,920
look at that move

1269
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,540
look at that one

1270
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:25,159
right after four o'clock earnings

1271
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:34,620
[Music]

1272
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,440
sweet sweet look at that that's a nice

1273
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,800
rip

1274
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,480
so there you go

1275
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,820
I stated that I didn't think

1276
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,219
back here that we'd see a higher high we

1277
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:52,580
got one

1278
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,480
to now

1279
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,159
does that type of thing invite you to

1280
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,440
want to go out here and crack the code

1281
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,120
of this day does it make you want to go

1282
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,980
out there and try to

1283
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,719
figure out

1284
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:06,239
something that I admit to use there's

1285
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,400
better trading opportunities

1286
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,800
away from these days

1287
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,159
and all you need is one good week

1288
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,980
out of a month and it'll fix a lot of

1289
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:19,380
bad smaller little errors

1290
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,780
you only need one profitable day per

1291
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,860
week

1292
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:25,380
to do well and stop you don't need the

1293
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,100
everyday trade

1294
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,960
but when you come into this business and

1295
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,880
you're brand new and you listen to

1296
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,460
Instagram mindsets

1297
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,199
and people that

1298
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,480
don't really have I understand what

1299
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,280
they're supposed to be doing and they're

1300
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,020
influencing more than they're educating

1301
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,100
you get wrapped up in that kind of stuff

1302
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,840
and you think that trading is every day

1303
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,159
always

1304
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,800
trying to do something you know hyper

1305
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,060
active

1306
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:55,260
and that's not what you should be

1307
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,840
thinking it is

1308
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,239
it's like a sniper they're now out there

1309
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,280
Tommy gunning you know spraying all

1310
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,900
their bullets into the direction of

1311
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,580
their target they're waiting for that

1312
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:10,199
one Mark to walk into their crosshairs

1313
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:14,580
and then they gently squeeze the trigger

1314
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,040
with the expectation that when they

1315
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,920
shoot they know that that shot has to

1316
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,679
make an impact on the Target because

1317
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:24,360
when they shoot

1318
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,000
the adversaries can triangulate and get

1319
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,620
a vector on where they're at

1320
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,719
so they're exposing themselves they're

1321
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:32,880
that's their risk

1322
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,860
they're stopwise their stop loss is

1323
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:39,260
their life their soul leaving their body

1324
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,540
get so many chances to get stopped out

1325
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:44,460
in that environment if you treat your

1326
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:46,500
trading like that not that you should be

1327
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,139
making everything hinge on your trade

1328
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:50,940
being successful

1329
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,280
but you should be thinking about the

1330
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,920
measure of risk like that

1331
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,159
not to be para paralyzing you

1332
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:01,739
or create Traders paralysis but you need

1333
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:05,520
to think about like would a sniper

1334
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,840
where

1335
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,139
rainbow sweatpants and headband out

1336
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:11,880
there in the jungle

1337
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,239
getting ready to take down somebody no

1338
01:35:15,239 --> 01:35:16,620
they're gonna be camouflaged they're

1339
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,960
going to be in amongst the natural

1340
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,420
setting

1341
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,980
but they're not going to walk out there

1342
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,719
and

1343
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,719
no foliage

1344
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,219
and when you're out here on days like

1345
01:35:29,219 --> 01:35:30,120
this

1346
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,040
you get

1347
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,719
like a spotlight Channel and you you

1348
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,040
can't

1349
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,139
You Can't Hide and wait for your good

1350
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:39,380
shot

1351
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,360
because the more you hurt yourself just

1352
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,620
know that that's a Learning lesson

1353
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,600
growth pains

1354
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,980
growing pains are never fun

1355
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,139
the mistake I made and some of you might

1356
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:54,239
make as well is that you think you're

1357
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,980
gonna figure it out and know what to do

1358
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,560
every time these days come

1359
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,780
but you don't appreciate the magnitude

1360
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,239
of how much they're manipulated

1361
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:05,520
like you have no idea

1362
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,840
you will

1363
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,179
over time watching it you'll say oh man

1364
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:11,340
it wasn't obvious at the time but now I

1365
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,600
can see it

1366
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,480
right now this looks like you'll find 20

1367
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,159
different retail things in here that you

1368
01:36:17,159 --> 01:36:18,600
should have bought and sold from that's

1369
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,060
because hindsight's 2020.

1370
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,320
you're going to see all kinds of things

1371
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,679
in here even maybe I have taught

1372
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,080
oh yeah I see a concept here I see a an

1373
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,360
overblock there

1374
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,040
unless you know the narrative none of

1375
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,659
that stuff's gonna work

1376
01:36:33,659 --> 01:36:36,540
none of it will work

1377
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,480
and that's the that's the we're at the

1378
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:40,860
roulette table this is my last analogy

1379
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:42,120
I'm going to close it because I need to

1380
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,860
get something

1381
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,960
raw at the casino

1382
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,400
and we're standing around the roulette

1383
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:48,600
table

1384
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,400
and you had the Bulls

1385
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,139
they're betting on black you have the

1386
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,280
Bears they're bet known red

1387
01:36:55,739 --> 01:36:57,480
you think it's 50 50 you got a 50 50

1388
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,860
chance

1389
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,600
it's black or red

1390
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,940
but you don't realize that the market

1391
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:06,139
makers are green

1392
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:11,760
MS favorable for them to take both sides

1393
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,080
out

1394
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,219
Green's coming up

1395
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,780
and they'll play Green

1396
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:20,639
all day long on non-trial payroll

1397
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:23,159
they'll play Green on

1398
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:26,420
a rate announcement like this

1399
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,179
it did move a lot

1400
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:36,320
I mean think about the total range here

1401
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:39,600
not in terms of where we have been in

1402
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,340
terms of volatility

1403
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,940
now years ago when I first started this

1404
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,380
would have been ridiculous in terms of

1405
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:49,320
volatility but this is nothing in the

1406
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,580
grand scheme of things where we are now

1407
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,340
and that was the first clue that we're

1408
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,719
not seeing a whole lot of movement here

1409
01:37:57,719 --> 01:37:58,860
remember I was telling you at two

1410
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,060
o'clock I was like yeah it's kind of

1411
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,620
lame actually

1412
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,380
and at 2 30 we saw a run

1413
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,800
it took the 640 buy side out

1414
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,840
and then

1415
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,360
Consolidated and go into four o'clock we

1416
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,340
have one more pump and creates a higher

1417
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,460
harm

1418
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,080
and we're sitting around that 640 level

1419
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,320
now

1420
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,199
so

1421
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,100
anyway

1422
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,860
learn not to be interested in doing this

1423
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:37,679
as a live trading day

1424
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,480
that's the main takeaway okay

1425
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,659
if you haven't at least took that

1426
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:45,420
and put that into your toolbox to say

1427
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,260
don't tread here

1428
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:52,100
do that here do that today

1429
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,320
I promise you unless you heard this

1430
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,139
unless you watched me try to do it today

1431
01:38:58,139 --> 01:38:59,760
you would have believed that I'm sitting

1432
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,040
around here running up and down all day

1433
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,080
long on a day like this and it's not

1434
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,239
like that on these types of days for me

1435
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,980
which is exactly why I tell you don't

1436
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,199
touch them

1437
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:11,760
I have other things I'm never going to

1438
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,860
teach you and even those things are not

1439
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,400
helping me

1440
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,219
there's no advantage on a day like this

1441
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:22,620
for me none

1442
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:24,659
I'm just like everyone else they weren't

1443
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:29,159
being respected that should not happen

1444
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:31,320
if they fail that means it's giving you

1445
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,600
a warning sign that you're offside or

1446
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,159
it's not it's not performing like you

1447
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:36,420
want to

1448
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,620
now

1449
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,540
as a younger man when I was 20 I took

1450
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,560
that as

1451
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,840
um yeah I'm just gonna get in your head

1452
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm gonna I'm gonna get ahead of my

1453
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,920
signal I know my signal will happen

1454
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,780
after I get in

1455
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:51,120
the market will bend in my will

1456
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,480
and that's many times what led to me

1457
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,199
blowing on an account

1458
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:00,780
when you're new you don't know that and

1459
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,040
you try to ignore it like it's not going

1460
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,239
to happen to you like you're going to be

1461
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:06,540
the exception to the rule

1462
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,860
and I I promise you every single person

1463
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:12,719
that's ever hurt themselves trying to do

1464
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,639
something like that it's the same way

1465
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,340
you're not any different I wasn't any

1466
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,960
different when it happened to me

1467
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,820
you think that it's going to work for

1468
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,040
you and you ignore even the smallest

1469
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,139
little inclination inside you know that

1470
01:40:25,139 --> 01:40:27,900
if I should be doing this but

1471
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,120
well we went to the casino we might as

1472
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,719
well bet at all

1473
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,739
and you can't do that kind of stuff on

1474
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:36,060
days like this

1475
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,179
you can't not and survive not do well

1476
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:41,639
you'll have severe drawdown

1477
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:44,219
you'll lose your funded accounts you'll

1478
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:46,500
blow your combine you'll go on severe

1479
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,300
drawdown with your Live accounts or even

1480
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,960
Bloom them

1481
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,940
because you get emotional you want to be

1482
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:55,320
right you want to fix something you did

1483
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,620
it wrong earlier now it seems obvious no

1484
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,480
just don't touch it

1485
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,120
use the information after the fact

1486
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,940
it's okay I feel confident that we're

1487
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,100
going to go higher or lower

1488
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,239
which

1489
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:11,340
let me take a quick look at this

1490
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,040
15 minute chart

1491
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,639
look at that

1492
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,800
internet that is really nuts you know if

1493
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,980
I were making the market for Nasdaq okay

1494
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,380
this is my last point on closing it I

1495
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,520
know I keep saying that but I'm always

1496
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,520
over delivering the idea of it trading

1497
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,800
order did here we went up into this area

1498
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,179
here

1499
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:35,820
I personally I would absolutely murder

1500
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:38,639
everything and go lower

1501
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,080
Thursday into Friday

1502
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,639
I'm not saying that's what it's going to

1503
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:43,320
happen but I wouldn't be surprised if

1504
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,719
that's what they do

1505
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:48,420
how am I going to trade Thursday

1506
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,340
I'm going to sleep

1507
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,500
through London I'm going to get up

1508
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,139
tomorrow around 6 30 New York local time

1509
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:58,320
and I'm going to identify where are my

1510
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,179
15-minute pools overcoated just like I

1511
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:01,920
have this chart here

1512
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,360
right now it's 7 15

1513
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,199
739.25 level

1514
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,820
or

1515
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,320
fifteen thousand five hundred and

1516
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,360
fifteen even and therefore if it goes

1517
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,480
lower than the

1518
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,719
483.75 level

1519
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:20,820
I am not confident right now to know

1520
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,040
which one I've wanted to know

1521
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,080
the way we closed today

1522
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,780
I wanted to know what I could tell you

1523
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,400
what side I won

1524
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,719
like when I'm doing the analysis

1525
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:32,159
commentary because that and this is

1526
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,900
where I think it's going to draw to I

1527
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,659
don't know I'm I'm torn between both of

1528
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:39,000
them so whenever that happens and it

1529
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,619
does happen in my analysis sometimes

1530
01:42:43,619 --> 01:42:45,540
students get frustrated because they

1531
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,860
want me to be able to know what it is

1532
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:49,560
all the time and sometimes I don't

1533
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,080
and you're not going to always either

1534
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,400
and you have to grow comfortable with

1535
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,080
not knowing sometimes and just waiting

1536
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,699
for more information more Intel that's

1537
01:42:56,699 --> 01:42:57,780
all

1538
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:01,260
and it cost me nothing today to sit out

1539
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,699
here and do this

1540
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:07,619
it cost me no money it cost me no

1541
01:43:07,619 --> 01:43:10,020
emotion whatsoever

1542
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,880
the only thing is is I was hoping at the

1543
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,920
end of it I would know what I wanted to

1544
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,420
do beforehand because I would tell you

1545
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,679
okay this is where we're going to draw

1546
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,780
to tomorrow and then we would all watch

1547
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:21,300
it I don't have that here nothing

1548
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,760
nothing really shows me one side or the

1549
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,199
other better than the other because

1550
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,360
they're just back and forth and this is

1551
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,119
a whole lot of nothing going on

1552
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:31,860
and

1553
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,139
I'm not confident co-signing on One

1554
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:35,639
Direction or the other so

1555
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:37,320
the best I have to do is explain to you

1556
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:40,260
how I'm going to treat it tomorrow I'm

1557
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:41,520
not going to look at London I'm not

1558
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,719
going to get up and see what London's

1559
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:43,500
doing

1560
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:48,500
I'm gonna wait until around 6 30. and

1561
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:52,080
I'll either get woke up from my mom from

1562
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,920
my children's mother or I will wake up

1563
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,380
by a circadian circadian alarm clock I

1564
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,360
don't have an alarm per se I just I know

1565
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,860
what I want to wake up and then usually

1566
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,179
get up at that time

1567
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:06,000
I sleep in like four hour Cycles so if I

1568
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,800
lay down I'm gonna get up between three

1569
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,679
hours and a half to four hours

1570
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:12,420
and that's usually how I sleep like that

1571
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:13,800
I do

1572
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,659
two of them and maybe a cat Napier there

1573
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:17,760
whenever I can fit it and I have

1574
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,340
cleaning rest

1575
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,159
but based on these specific levels what

1576
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:25,560
we're gravitating towards I know that

1577
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,719
I'll probably get a 20 or 30 handle

1578
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:30,239
range of opportunity

1579
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,340
if I'm waking up at ahead of seven

1580
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:34,560
o'clock between seven o'clock and 8 30

1581
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,300
I'll look to see if there's something I

1582
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,679
can use to frame it if not then I'll

1583
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,800
wait at 8 30 to 10 o'clock

1584
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,600
in that range between when the news

1585
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,119
embargo lifts and the opening range is

1586
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:48,179
complete 9 30 till uh 10 o'clock

1587
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:49,800
and then I'll do something with the

1588
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,639
Silver Bullet but I I already know I

1589
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:55,380
already know

1590
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:57,300
I'm making money tomorrow

1591
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,100
I already know that that's going to

1592
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:00,420
happen

1593
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:04,739
but I know there is a chance that is

1594
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:08,159
much more significant of me losing on a

1595
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:09,480
day like this

1596
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,239
so I have to respect that I have to also

1597
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,560
identify my own limitations

1598
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,540
you don't see that in the trading

1599
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,800
Community you don't see that on Twitter

1600
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,380
you don't see that in Instagram in

1601
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,820
Discord and

1602
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:24,960
Facebook

1603
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,460
you see go go baby

1604
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:32,340
and I I think that is foolish like you

1605
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:34,320
have to every but everybody has a

1606
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,760
weakness and there's no shame in

1607
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,020
admitting what your weakness is that's

1608
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:39,659
actually wisdom

1609
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,820
that's wisdom

1610
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,020
if you're a weight trainer and you know

1611
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,639
you can't bench press 500 pounds why the

1612
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:45,540
hell are you going to try to crawl under

1613
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:48,619
those plates and try to do it

1614
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,040
so you have to be responsible you have

1615
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,119
to know where you're going to excel

1616
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:56,400
where's your Edge where's your best

1617
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,619
trading conditions

1618
01:45:58,619 --> 01:46:01,679
but on it other side of that

1619
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,119
by journaling you learn by real data

1620
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:08,580
real Journal experiences or you were

1621
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:11,219
there it happened

1622
01:46:11,219 --> 01:46:13,739
what keeps repeating on what type of

1623
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:16,500
scenario what type of day

1624
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,960
what are you trying to trade

1625
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,880
what model are you trying to force but

1626
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,320
maybe not

1627
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,960
be supportive with your

1628
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,800
or compatible with your personality

1629
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,440
these are very important things that no

1630
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,960
one really touches on

1631
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,820
but they're the very defining moments

1632
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:39,080
that make you or break you

1633
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,880
there's a way to do this

1634
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,060
and be profitable and it'll feel easy it

1635
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,020
ain't easy because you have to go

1636
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:49,980
through a lot of stuff to figure

1637
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,199
yourself out and then what model fits

1638
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:52,860
you

1639
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,960
but when you get to that point it's easy

1640
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,600
to make money doing this

1641
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,119
you always have risk

1642
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:03,360
that's always there but it's easier

1643
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:07,080
to take the initiative and trade with

1644
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,840
that underlying risk because you know

1645
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,760
you're in a condition or an environment

1646
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,280
using a model that you trust that it's

1647
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:18,780
conducive for you to find success in it

1648
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,219
but in the beginning when you're brand

1649
01:47:20,219 --> 01:47:21,719
new or you're listening to someone

1650
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:25,100
that's too new to even know better

1651
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:27,600
you're going to have a whole lot of fear

1652
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,480
and anxiety and regret doing things like

1653
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,460
trading in these days

1654
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:34,260
I mean seriously folks let me look at

1655
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:38,600
this chart I mean look at that

1656
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,940
does that look like

1657
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:45,480
something that you can't live without

1658
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,179
like you got to be in that I have to be

1659
01:47:48,179 --> 01:47:53,119
in that ICT you understand I love her

1660
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,020
I get it

1661
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,580
but you'll grow up and you'll understand

1662
01:47:56,580 --> 01:48:00,360
that she's not the only one for you

1663
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:05,040
or he deference to the ladies

1664
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,080
so

1665
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,500
anyway

1666
01:48:10,139 --> 01:48:11,639
I'm not certain and we'll have another

1667
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:14,580
one of these before we close in November

1668
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,719
but uh I will do the non-farm payrolls

1669
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,060
going forward so that way we can get

1670
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:23,179
another
