it could go a little bit more than that

57
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,979
too depending on how overzealous it gets

58
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,539
going into close

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,099

it's not enough for me to want to do

61
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,639
anything with that I was actually trying

62
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,660
to take a losing trade

63
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,759
I was asked on Twitter I get this asked

64
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,319
a lot in conditional losing trade

65
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,440

66
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,360
have to create some kind of drawdown

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
to teach how to resolve drawdown

68
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,320
later this year so

69
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,339
I genuinely did try to uh

70
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,440
take a losing trade up here

71
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,600
I put the stopwatch real close thinking

72
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
it might bump it and didn't do it it

73
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,740
started working out my favor

74
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,720
and I said it would go down here instead

75
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
so I closed the trade and we've gone

76
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,240
down there I sold short in here

77
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
and add it to it here because I already

78
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,720
knew I thought it wasn't trade so I

79
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
might as well just make the best of it

80
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,920

00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,600

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,640
we'll take three

if you're wondering

114
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,079
that's how you were just thinking it why

115
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,180
they're almost out there is just above

120
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,420

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,199
little retracement up into this

concept of five handles or five points

which is 20 ticks in the e-mini SMP on

so fun

166

eighty nine and a quarter level

168
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,020

here

177
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,580
that would be counterparty to buy at a

178
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,020
lower price from sellers that want to

179
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,260
sell at a low price right below that low

180
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,600
and then one Fell Swoop they could take

181
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
that liquidity and reach into this

182
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,679

183
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
complete the numbers for today

189
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,460
run right over top of it and go right

and so we're about uh five minutes or so

197
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,320
one less than five minutes for that to

198
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,500
begin

199
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
all of this drop from here to here is

200
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,700
nicely delivered efficient

201
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,059
inefficiency here was repriced too

202
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,919
all this back and forth price action

203
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,780
then down we had an inefficiency here

204
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,539
we've been in here multiple times

205
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,100
we've hit the bottom of the Bison

206
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,780
efficiency

207
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,059
so it's all green light for it to go

208
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,260
lower

209
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,299
and pair up that

210
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:20,059
sells out liquidity deliver inefficiency

211
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,880
over here to efficient

212
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,980
right in here

213
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm not saying it's the lowest of the

214
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,080
day but that's all I'm looking for

215
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,659
so inside of all this fractal

216
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,760
that's what I'm looking for for

217
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,020
the completion of that run

218
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,520
being Friday not for on Friday I'm sorry

219
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,620
nine from April Friday

220
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,700
um

221
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,980
I pretty much I hammered this today I

222
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,240
got I beat it up pretty bad

223
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,120
to see

224
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,600
confusions

225
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,340
and then I'll change the chart so you

226
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,159
can see it's not

227
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,900
Market replay or anything like that

228
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,080
and I apologize I know it probably get

229
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,039
something nervous moving the trial

230
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,000
around because I don't like it when

231
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,659
people do it it gets on my nerves

232
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,000
but I want to add that uh

233
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
extra detail in here

234
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,020

237
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,039
the question I like to always ask is

238
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,840
internal dialogue

239
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,779
like if I was long

240
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,580
and I have my stop loss below that low

241
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,100
what I feel safe right now

242
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,299
and I wouldn't

243
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,919
and they should be trembling right now

244
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,220
too

245
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,179
they're not going to get a chance to get

246
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,899
off of it now

247
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,279
quickly search for it

248
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,980
notice the time

249
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,860
three o'clock

250
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,279
or is it liquidity

251
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,240
below 15 289 a quarter

252
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,860
and what's below that

253
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,880
in inefficiency

254
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,020
so no I don't want to see it come back

255
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,880
up to the bottom

256
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,620
on that old vitamin balance or certain

257
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,600
efficiency right here I don't want to

258
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,460
see that bump it again

259
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,100
so it either goes to my limit order

260
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
or limit orders

261
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,539
or it's dossing out there and I'm

262
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,320
content with that

thank you

266
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,899
I stopped sitting right above this

267
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,480
really smooth highs

268
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,179
like those out and then come down

269
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,940
go to my target it's okay

270
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,500
I've already smashed it today pretty

271
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,679
good

272
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,679
it's really nice being in a position

273
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,480
where

274
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,940
being right is not the

275
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,740
end result

276
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,500
of choice it's just you're in a position

277
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,120
now where if it goes to your Target's

278
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,620
wonderful and if it doesn't you've

279
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,539
already taken something off multiple

280
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,159
times

281
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,720
and I was all over this thing like white

282
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
on rice today so

283
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,720
hammered pretty good

284
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,220
you know if all things being equal it

285
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,899
should deliver on this candle or the

286
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,740
very next candle

287
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,059
foreign

288
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,360
for those that are asking why would I

289
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,740
say something like that you can see a

290
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,059
small little separation between this

291
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,260
candle's low

292
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,880
this candle is high we went up in there

293
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,179
once twice and we started the price run

294
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,760
that went below this candle's opening

295
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,899
right there

296
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,019
so these two up close candles together

297
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,360
I want to see price move away from that

298
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,399
when it does that if it doesn't then I

299
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,539
have to accept the fact that I may get

300
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,960
stopped out

301
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,559

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,159
no emotion no reason for concern no

excitement when you're right

304
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,460
it's a continuous Balancing Act

305
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,440
that Trader must uh maintain

foreign

307
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,919
in a lot here in the last hour

308
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,940
so you're getting a feel for why I speed

309
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,040
these things up it's like watching paint

310
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,760
dry sometimes

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,480
thank you

313
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,640
so I'm looking at I'm wondering does it

314
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,760
want to really accelerate down to

315
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,140
this order block here these two

316
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,119
consecutive down close candles the high

317
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,859
to the opening

318
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,380
that would be a very sensitive

319
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,060
price point for me

320
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,359
because they have a fair value Gap in

321
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,000
the same area

322
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
but I'm leaving what I have here

323
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,040
in terms of the orders if it can book

324
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,960
those orders that completes my week

325
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,359
lots of manipulation here

326
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,140
it's one

[Music]

328
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,640
see if we get that final one here

329
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
inside that varying that

330
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,099
take this stop and roll it down to the

331
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,940
rejection block right there on this

332
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,859
a closed candle

333
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,720
so if it stops me there I'm comfortable

334
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,740
with that I don't care

335
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,920
it's traded to the market maker cell

336
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,560
model South Side liquidity which is the

337
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,540
reason why I had that limit order there

338
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,140
and the two remaining contracts I have

339
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,420
Are Being Framed on the basis of that

340
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,240
small Little Ferry you got there

341
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,099
so if it can deliver that wonderful if

342
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,900
it doesn't it stops me out and it's just

343
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,380

just like it was explained

348
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,260
in source code

349
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,440
so my friends that is a 26 240 day

350
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,380
all over this thing

351
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,220
right out of my

352
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,480
collection notes and mentorship

353
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,020
you can see that all the fills

354
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,940
I'll take them all for you as you can

355
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,140
see it's not Market replay

356
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,119
and I'll toggle to

357
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,300
yes so it's not like I can go back and

358
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,980
pull them up again once you change the

359
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020

360
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,520
that stuff

361
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,280
it wouldn't be there okay so again

362
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,579
that's 26 240 dollars

363
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,180
all on the es I'm sorry on the uh NQ

364
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,780
up

365
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,700
and down

366
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,859

367
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,619
