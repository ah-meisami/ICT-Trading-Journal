1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,440
foreign

2
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,899
folks I hope everybody's doing well

3
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
so tonight we're doing a little bit of a

4
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,840
lecture here on some important

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,659
information about finding setups

6
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,659
and I get a lot of questions

7
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,260
as a mentor teaching Forex and recently

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,000
index futures

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,320
and the things I'm going to talk about

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,960
tonight are not limited

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,659
to any one particular asset class so

12
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,920
it's kind of like remove all of the

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,700
uncertainty

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,799
of where you're supposed to be looking

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,579
in the charts when am I supposed to be

16
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,320
utilizing electronic trading hours what

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,900
am I going to be referring to regular

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,200
trading hours for what reason what type

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,079
of setups form when

20
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,439
and that way it allows you

21
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,840
to have a setup for life

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,420
now some of you may have thought this

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
was going to be a pattern

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,020
or a PD array lecture it's not

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,299
I'm teaching you how to find your own

26
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,000
setups but specifically

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,300
when and where they form that's the part

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,819
that is always a constant

29
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,800
that's the thing that

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,540
a lot of new Traders and those that are

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,080
struggling as a break even Trader lucida

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,060
it's a matter of knowing what to look

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,340
for and when

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,040
it incorporates Market profiling and

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,140
that is not Market profile in the sense

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,599
that we're using like v-wop and things

37
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
like that

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,739
we're talking about schematics

39
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,420
things that I've taught and have shared

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,760
publicly on this YouTube channel

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
you can find that information in the

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
core content where I'm dealing with

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
specific day profiles

44
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,040
the topic would be alerted day trading

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,500
and

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,379
I cover a lot of this stuff also when

47
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,180
I'm talking about

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,200
specific market reviews and

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,319
I understand it many of you you maybe

50
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,340
knew

51
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,319
okay and you wanna you wanna one two

52
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,239
three easy get me in get me out pattern

53
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,340
and I've already produced all that okay

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,140
it's on the YouTube channel

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,280
but

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
for the folks that really want to find a

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,700
lot more setups or not be limited to a

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,700
one-trick pony not that that's a bad

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,620
thing because the 2022 model is

60
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,239
excellent

61
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,700
the optimal trade entry pattern is

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,200
excellent

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,080
so when I talk about these areas in the

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,239
marketplace tonight

65
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,580
and I promise we will not be here very

66
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,739
long usually when I say this on Twitter

67
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,260
and I'll do a Twitter space we go for

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,519
hours and hours it doesn't feel like

69
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,519
hours to me but yeah I do have a time

70
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,040
limit tonight so I have to get through

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
this and because of that I presented it

72
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,720
in a PowerPoint

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,299
presentation so it helps me keep

74
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,760
my focus so I always have some kind of a

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
monologue coming in

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,060
so I want to kind of set

77
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,920
the expectations

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,540
for everyone that's going into this

79
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,459
study so that way you know what it is

80
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,560
you're going to be trying to glean from

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,720
it what's the purpose

82
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,699
and then we'll get down to the

83
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,579
nitty-gritty it'll be right to the point

84
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,680
and I'll show you some details in terms

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,880
of executions and such

86
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,800
SO algorithmic trading with ICT models

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,639
for all assets and again the premise is

88
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,340
one trade setup for life

89
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,320
now

90
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,940
what do you think that would entail

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
something that would repeat

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,840
over and over again

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,880
it's not ambiguous

94
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,800
it's very specific

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,960
now when you see me doing my trade

96
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,340
executions

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,460
sometimes they look too good to be true

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,220
and sometimes I'm question as to whether

99
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
or not I'm using something that's

100
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,479
delayed and whatnot and today I had a

101
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,000
little bit of a Clank today I've shared

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,220
some things that uh my wife wasn't

103
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,259
expecting me to spend any time online

104
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,060
today but uh

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,639
I felt like I wanted to share today

106
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,620
and I answered a couple things that came

107
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,000
up over the years

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
in terms of doubts or concerns

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,940
and

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,919
I really want you to think about the

111
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
lesson tonight that we're going to cover

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
and think about how your setup

113
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,620
your multiplier the PD array that you

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,600
gravitate to most it may be the fair

115
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,900
value Gap it may be a breaker pattern it

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,840
may be the optimal trade entry pattern

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,180
it could be a simple order block

118
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,880
it could be a turtle soup

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,039
it could be a number of things

120
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,320
whatever it could be the inversion fair

121
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,539
value Gap

122
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,180
whatever that PD array is that you

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,880
see easily in a chart the one that you

124
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
don't have to look too hard for or

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
strain your eye or

126
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,220
scour through the candlesticks to find

127
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,199
it the one it just simply makes sense to

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,460
you when you see price action your eye

129
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,780
goes right to it

130
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,699
that my friends is the One You're

131
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,199
supposed to be looking at that's the one

132
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,699
you start with it does not mean that

133
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,639
it's going to be your entire career

134
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,320
it just means that that's the one that

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,000
resonates with you right now it's a new

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
student of mine

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,600
and then you grow from that

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
I promise you

139
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,919
when you learn one PD array

140
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,539
and how to use the information I'm going

141
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,680
to share tonight

142
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,380
it'll be so much easier for you to see

143
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,539
all the things that form

144
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,160
in all the PD arrays that I've taught

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,259
and then we'll teach

146
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,940
but you have to have some kind of a

147
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,979
baseline to grow from

148
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,840
and if you're rushing through it or

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,900
trying to push too much on yourself

150
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,819
the the time limits that you place on

151
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,919
yourself are learning how to do it is

152
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,780
unrealistic something you're going to

153
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,580
learn sooner than others and other is

154
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,139
going to require more time

155
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,600
I can't speed that up for you you're

156
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,240
bringing in your own learning curve and

157
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,319
the things that you're going to worry

158
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,100
about

159
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,919
are going to find its way to the bin

160
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,199
as you learn how to focus on the things

161
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,819
I'm teaching you and not anything more

162
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,639
than that per lesson

163
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,259
so

164
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,340
let's get into it

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,300
all right so draw on liquidity okay it's

166
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,819
the sole purpose of price delivery and I

167
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,880
wish to thank Patrick Weiland

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,720
for getting this screenshot from his

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
live stream today I needed to make a

170
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
point about uh liquidity and the

171
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,380
resources that are available in the

172
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,199
market today and how I'm going to help

173
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,280
you

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,819
not lean On Tools like this now

175
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,800
admittedly

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,319
if this type of thing was in existence

177
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,419
when I first started in the 90s that's

178
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,259
the 1990s by the way not the 1900s as my

179
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,580
youngest son always says makes you sound

180
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,860
like I'm really really old

181
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,919
but uh this is a screenshot of the book

182
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,979
map okay I am not

183
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,680
a affiliate with them I'm not suggesting

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
you should subscribe to it and I'm not

185
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
trying to kick dirt in their face either

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,460
I'm just saying that

187
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,000
the primary function for that tool

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,280
can be made redundant with tonight's

189
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,180
lesson

190
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,819
now I don't want you to take my word for

191
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,399
it you're welcome to compare and

192
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,159
contrast and then see if there is any

193
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,659
validity to what I'm going to say

194
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,000
tonight but I promise you you're gonna

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,700
see that these things while useful to a

196
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,740
new student to a new Trader they're

197
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,480
absolutely wonderful crutches and that's

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,300
not to be demeaning or to talk down to

199
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,700
it because believe me if I but I had

200
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,399
access to this when I first started I

201
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,839
would have absolutely subscribe to it

202
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,420
because it would have helped me learn

203
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,860
faster

204
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,899
the whole premise of liquidity but the

205
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,820
problem is with a tool like this

206
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,180
it kind of like brings more attention to

207
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,580
levels of liquidity that are not so

208
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,760
pertinent to right now okay or what's

209
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,380
about to take place in terms of a

210
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,779
narrative and price action okay and when

211
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,600
I teach smart money Concepts

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,820
by the way when you hear SMC it's my

213
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,980
Concepts okay when I talked about it and

214
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,480
first started teaching it I referred to

215
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,260
them as smart money Concepts and when we

216
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,839
look at liquidity

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,080
there's a specific range in mind

218
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,779
when I'm looking at my charts and I hear

219
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,779
or see people in comments

220
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,120
um I I've watched other YouTubers and

221
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,040
their complaint is you never really

222
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,860
understand why ICT is picking this high

223
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,839
or that low he's hiding it from you

224
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,180
that's tonight I'm going to

225
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,920
show you that that has never been the

226
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,420
case I've always said these things but

227
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,700
it's always tucked in during the

228
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,580
discussion the boring parts

229
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,100
because you're not trying to listen it

230
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,240
goes over your head that's why when you

231
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
go back and look at old videos it's been

232
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,959
there the whole time but you're looking

233
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,540
for that one trick pony that magic trick

234
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,680
that sleight of hand thing is going to

235
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
let you go out on social media and look

236
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,140
like a rock star

237
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,700
if you want to be able to do that you

238
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,380
have to learn like tonight this is a

239
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,660
lesson that gets to the heart of the

240
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,760
matter where is it that you should be

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,740
framing your focus

242
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,440
and what liquidity what specific

243
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,980
liquidity does ICT refer to

244
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,440
yes we're going to cover that and you're

245
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,360
going to see by contrast if you look at

246
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,040
the things I'm going to cover tonight

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,680
and utilize it with this resource here

248
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,820
book map

249
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,740
I don't know if they offer a free trial

250
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,620
I don't know that at all but there's

251
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,440
YouTubers out there that stream and kind

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,300
of like share this at least their

253
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
Affiliates they want you to sign out

254
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,560
with them I'm not saying don't use it

255
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm not saying you should use it I'm

256
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
just saying that for folks that are

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,740
trying to do this without having extra

258
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,920
things to pay for or look at

259
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,959
you can take the information tonight and

260
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
compare and contrast and see if it

261
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,779
doesn't really get to the heart of the

262
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,220
matter in terms of where liquidity it

263
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,920
should be focused on for any one given

264
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,760
period intraday

265
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,220
all right so when we first start talking

266
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,200
about

267
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,540
liquidity the assumption is is you're a

268
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,420
day trader whether you're a scalper

269
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,120
whether you are a session Trader

270
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,820
a intraday day trader where you're

271
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
trying to do the entire daily range

272
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,320
or if you're just a short-term Trader or

273
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,660
you're looking to time the market for

274
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,820
your longer term swing trade or position

275
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,399
trade all of that

276
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,220
is encapsulated in tonight's discussion

277
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,399
so it's not a just an intraday chart

278
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,899
concept

279
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,360
you can use these Concepts to really

280
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,360
narrow down the amount of risk reduce it

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,579
to

282
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,200
minuscule amounts it doesn't mean it's

283
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,779
without loss doesn't mean that you will

284
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,820
have winning trades all the time it just

285
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,500
means that if you understand the

286
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
concepts I'm covering tonight

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,360
you will have the ability to go in and

288
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,040
fine-tune your risk model

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,779
be able to reduce the amount of risk

290
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,480
that's associated with your trades and

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,180
also time the market

292
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,860
know where the Market's going to go to

293
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,680
next okay

294
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,240
first session we're going to talk about

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,640
is the PM session ranges

296
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,839
okay and this is always going to be

297
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
referred to in terms of previous day

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
okay so previous day we are going to be

299
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,220
referring to

300
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,880
the 1 30 pm to 4 pm time window and this

301
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
is always in New York local time

302
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,800
now I'm saying that because I want you

303
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,839
to set your trading view chart

304
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,300
to New York local time

305
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,639
I say this as much as I can in all my

306
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,139
lectures because

307
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,540
I get confused when I talk to people

308
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,920
around the world and you're in different

309
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,440
time zones and I have made mistakes in

310
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,680
turn in terms of telling them what their

311
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,200
conversion would be so to eliminate all

312
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,760
that confusion if you just simply set

313
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
your charts to New York local time

314
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,560
and look at the charts that way yeah all

315
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,380
the confusion goes away it's very simple

316
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,839
so PM session ranges you're looking for

317
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,100
the highest high in the lowest low

318
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,760
between 1 30 pm and 4 pm now

319
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,639
is there any ambiguity there

320
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,899
no

321
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,000
it's very simple it's succinct right to

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,320
the point

323
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,060
now what do you do with it

324
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,579
if you are bullish

325
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,800
okay and we are trading in close

326
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,260
proximity to that range as we see here

327
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
this example here

328
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm using the June contract before

329
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,180
rollover took place at the time of this

330
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,160
recording and live stream we are looking

331
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,920
at the September contract for the

332
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,380
indices for 2023 but I'm showing you an

333
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,120
example because this is something I

334
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,700
utilized in commentary something I use

335
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
in terms of learning analysis and

336
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,779
executions and such but I want you to

337
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,019
understand that when we look at

338
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,740
PM session ranges it is always referred

339
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,639
to in regular trading hours

340
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,500
notice this down here in the lower right

341
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,880
hand corner

342
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,139
let's make the chart a little bit bigger

343
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,620
so down here in the right hand corner

344
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,920
the rth that's regular trading hours

345
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
now you can toggle this if your

346
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,139
membership permits you I don't

347
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,600
know what

348
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,959
I guess membership is required for

349
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,760
trading view

350
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,660
um

351
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,339
if you're absolutely against treating

352
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,320
you then I'm sorry you're gonna have to

353
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
have to find the equivalent and I don't

354
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,100
know what that would be for you okay I

355
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,540
chose treating you because my community

356
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,120
said go to trading view when I left mt4

357
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,079
so we're all here now and

358
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,459
I don't know what it's going to cost you

359
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,139
and I don't have an affiliate program

360
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,760
with trading view I get no money for it

361
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,800
if you subscribe to it and I don't know

362
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,660
what the

363
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,480
amount of membership would be to allow

364
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,180
to get that I don't know okay so give me

365
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,160
the liberty and latitude to be able to

366
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
talk freely and you're gonna have to

367
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,180
work that on your own

368
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,500
but this toggle from rth to electronic

369
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,839
trading hours eth okay one or the other

370
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,160
is going to be utilized if we're going

371
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,199
to be looking for PM session

372
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,899
ranges it's always going to be into

373
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,579
the previous day

374
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,519
the time window the amount of time that

375
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,860
you're looking inside of what price

376
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,079
range what high are you looking at ICT

377
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,839
what's low are you looking at ICT

378
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,699
regular trading hours

379
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,060
it cuts out all the overnight Trading

380
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,740
the algorithm once we start trading

381
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,540
regular trading session hours the next

382
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,620
day

383
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,660
it's going to refer back to these

384
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,519
specific times

385
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,579
and what liquidity exists above and

386
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,699
below it so if we're bullish and we're

387
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,980
trading near the opening in this little

388
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,839
orange line here that's going to be in

389
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,100
every slide

390
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,339
that denotes the 9 30 opening bell

391
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,620
you know when everybody's on CNBC

392
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,720
they clap their hands

393
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,320
that's when the opening valve occurs for

394
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,720
the stock indices and stock market now

395
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,060
obviously they're trading all night long

396
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,820
but that opening window

397
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,920
starts that opening range for the next

398
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,240
30 minutes

399
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,720
where will that usually run for the

400
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,699
higher level if you're bullish

401
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,880
and we take out the PM session low where

402
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
it's going to be sell side below that

403
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,800
that's wonderful because if it's bullish

404
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
and we have a higher time frame premises

405
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,160
expecting the market to go higher how do

406
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,959
we know that that's what I've been

407
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,000
teaching you when I do my reviews or I

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,560
do my commentary or if I'm pointing to

409
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,660
something on Twitter if you're not

410
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,920
following me on Twitter you're really

411
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,959
missing out because I'm doing a lot of

412
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,139
information there and like real short

413
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,940
succinct manner I'm taking your

414
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,220
attention to right then and there

415
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,140
today I did it and a lot of people

416
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,240
actually followed it and it's not to be

417
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,699
used as a signal service but I'm calling

418
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,380
things live there drawing your attention

419
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,699
to it so that way you can study it real

420
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,839
time

421
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,699
but if you're bullish

422
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,280
and the market drops down below PM

423
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,720
session lows

424
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,179
notice that this low here and this low

425
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,199
here

426
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,839
that's encapsulated inside of the

427
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,580
1 30 to 4 o'clock

428
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,100
New York local time

429
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,140
So Below those relative equal lows

430
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,880
there's cell sign liquidity

431
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,340
it's really simple it's it's simple

432
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,919
isn't it when when you go through the

433
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,900
process of listening to me and doing the

434
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,520
things I tell you to do and I justify

435
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
why you should do all these things

436
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
that's the boring part

437
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,380
the folks that have started making real

438
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,880
money

439
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,440
six figures

440
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,460
payouts okay Doctor salaries in a month

441
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,900
or less

442
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
that stuff comes by listening and

443
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,360
practicing and going into their charts

444
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,880
and not taking my word for but going in

445
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,679
and seeing if the things I'm saying are

446
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,500
in the true

447
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,179
this logic

448
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,000
if we're bullish we'd like to see cell

449
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,740
site taking why because that means that

450
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,299
smart money would accumulate those sell

451
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,860
side liquidity

452
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,440
and absorb it

453
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,179
for their buy side so they're going to

454
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,640
treat that sell side as counterparty to

455
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,320
their smart money buying so they're

456
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,640
accumulating

457
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,200
in the Judas swing the drop down here

458
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,220
just goes into this area here where the

459
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,380
liquidity is so we definitely want to be

460
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,140
looking at previous day's session

461
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,320
not just any old high and low

462
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,200
the high in the lows between 130 and 4

463
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,059
o'clock New York local time that's the

464
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,559
PM session

465
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
that range the highs and the lows

466
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
there's liquidity above and below it

467
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
if we're looking for higher prices we

468
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,380
definitely expect it to be running to

469
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,720
the buy side but at the opening we

470
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
expect not always but we expect we

471
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,020
anticipate a run lower that Judah swing

472
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,020
that every Tom Dick and Harry on social

473
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,360
media are going to chase that they're

474
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,740
gonna think it's breaking the new lows

475
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,299
it's going to keep going lower

476
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,679
no

477
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,320
no no no no it's only running down air

478
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,539
to take sellers in the marketplace and

479
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,299
they're going to buy them

480
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,760
and then the market runs to buy side now

481
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
you could be a Trader that simply takes

482
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,539
this order

483
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,660
here as along as a turtle suit now

484
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,460
admittedly

485
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,919
this takes a great deal of conviction

486
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,080
it probably won't be the first thing you

487
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,299
reach for learning from me

488
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,460
in fact it took a lot of time for me to

489
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,580
trust that idea of buying below old lows

490
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,740
and selling above old highs for entries

491
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,500
not targets it's easy to do it for a

492
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,640
Target

493
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,220
but it's entirely different it takes an

494
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,100
entire paradigm shift in your thinking

495
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
to go into the marketplace and

496
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
anticipate that as an entry

497
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,340
but it can be done and it takes time how

498
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,020
you get there is you study old moves

499
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,080
like this and you Journal them

500
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,419
but your model could simply be wait for

501
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,340
the sell side in the pre previous PM

502
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,620
session range if you're bullish that's

503
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,940
your buy if you're going in that means

504
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,200
that you're expecting the weekly rings

505
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,360
to expand higher the draw on liquidity

506
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,179
higher on the weekly time frame we cut

507
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,799
out all that stuff in the previous

508
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,720
discussions

509
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
but going down into liquidity like this

510
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,740
when we're bullish we would reasonably

511
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,020
expect it to run for what the buy side

512
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,240
where what buy side what high are you

513
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,740
looking at ICT

514
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,380
that one right there why because it's

515
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,179
inside the range between 1 30 and 4

516
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,640
o'clock Hal pray tell

517
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,740
is that complicated

518
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,200
it's not complicated and I've taught

519
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,260
this ad nauseum over and over and over

520
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,280
again

521
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,559
but you're not listening so I'm taking

522
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,840
you by the hands knowing right into the

523
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,419
charts that way everything is perfectly

524
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,580
laid out for you you have absolutely

525
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,900
zero excuses you have no excuses now to

526
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,059
know what I'm anticipating what range am

527
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,440
I looking at

528
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm not hiding it from you folks I want

529
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
you to succeed I really really want you

530
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,980
to succeed

531
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,539
if you can't learn it from tonight's

532
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,100
lesson I don't know how to do it better

533
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,700
than this one

534
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,880
okay

535
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,340
going further into the day now we're

536
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,580
considering a a full 24 hour rotation

537
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,320
okay so over the course of 24 hours what

538
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
is the mind of ICT what are the inner

539
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,700
musings of inner circle Trader

540
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm going through the process of going

541
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,159
through this very routine right here

542
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,740
I look at PM session range

543
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,700
if it's not a factor or it's not to be

544
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,320
considered because we're not in close

545
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,000
proximity to that range because we could

546
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,799
be significantly higher or lower around

547
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,120
9 30.

548
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,280
so what am I looking for then if I'm not

549
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,980
close to PM session previous PM session

550
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,120
130 P.M to 4 P.M range

551
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,820
at the time of 9 30 at the opening bell

552
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,500
and I'm watching that next 30 minutes

553
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,380
which is the opening range

554
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,840
what am I going to look for then next if

555
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
it's not that

556
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,799
I'm looking at the London session raid

557
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,120
that means I'm going to be looking at

558
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,440
the range between two o'clock in the

559
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,059
morning and five o'clock in the morning

560
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,360
New York local time now again

561
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,299
tell me is that complicated

562
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,700
no simple

563
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,400
so in your charts you want to be

564
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,860
annotating what those levels are now you

565
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,559
can do it like this here where I have

566
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,440
actual annotations that I hand draw I

567
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,080
don't have a indicator thing that plots

568
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,600
them for me I prefer the high touch over

569
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,620
high tech

570
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,240
it means I'm putting some thought into

571
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,700
it I get closer to the marketplace by

572
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,179
doing that and sharing it with you

573
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,400
I just don't trust an indicator to do it

574
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,919
okay so I'm an old guy I'm a dinosaur

575
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,659
I'm used to doing everything by hand

576
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,400
anyway and believe me it doesn't take

577
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
that long to tell me you have to have

578
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,360
because it saves time and it's a cop-out

579
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,000
you just are lazy ain't nothing wrong

580
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,559
with lazy I mean lazy people can do

581
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,539
things very efficiently if they're smart

582
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,159
but let's Zoom this in here

583
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,539
all right so London session Reigns

584
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,419
if we are not in close proximity to the

585
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,080
previous PM session at 9 30. remember

586
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
this orange line here denotes the 9 30

587
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,059
opening bell

588
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,380
of the stock market

589
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,640
so

590
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,700
where are we at in terms of proximity

591
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,940
so we're starting the trading here

592
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,500
so where are we are we in close

593
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,659
proximity to a PM session high or low

594
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,000
but we are in close proximity to what

595
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,919
London session by side we're digging

596
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,520
into that so all of this can be viewed

597
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
pre-930 as a Judas swing

598
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,500
now notice

599
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,120
am I showing you regular trading hours

600
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,980
or electronic trading hours

601
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,240
electronic trading hours so that way

602
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,620
you're gonna be able to see the

603
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,020
overnight trading if you have it toggled

604
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,299
to regular trading hours you won't see

605
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,760
this information folks it will be hidden

606
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,940
from you which is one of the conundrums

607
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,820
that retail Traders fall into they don't

608
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,340
know either how to toggle electronic

609
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,600
trading hours or regular trading hours

610
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,280
and even if they do they don't know what

611
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,600
to do with the information

612
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,360
it's hidden it's in plain sight but it's

613
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,980
hidden from them you don't have that

614
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,440
excuse anymore tonight so

615
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,960
London session buy side liquidity we're

616
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,360
seeing that read up into it here and

617
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,220
then

618
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
where's the low in it

619
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,760
remember two o'clock to five o'clock in

620
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
the morning New York local time

621
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
that's not ambiguous what is the range

622
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,539
the highest high and the lowest low

623
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,000
here and here

624
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,419
so if we raided the buy side and we did

625
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,039
it on a run

626
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,620
that's a Judas

627
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,720
we anticipate that as a false run higher

628
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,640
and then we're going to see does it

629
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,320
shift lower how can we use that

630
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,659
information well you can use the 2022

631
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,100
model

632
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,840
you can use

633
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,539
uh breaker a parish breaker you can use

634
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,039
the ICT optimal trade entry

635
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,580
in here from this low

636
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,159
to the high is a fair bag Gap

637
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,720
this is a shift in Market structure

638
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,880
below this low right there

639
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,520
that's your 2022 model or optimal trade

640
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,360
entry

641
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,840
what would you be aiming for

642
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,059
numbing session South Side liquidity

643
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,760
do you have to sit through a retracement

644
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,679
yes

645
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,299
but we'll cover that

646
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,480
because that in itself is also

647
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,340
a range that we utilize intraday

648
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,980
notice what I'm taking you through

649
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,580
the whole routine of 24 hours where are

650
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,020
we at open open is 9 30.

651
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,059
we have to wait for 30 minutes because

652
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,279
there's going to either be a run higher

653
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,500
or lower or it may consolidate and then

654
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,059
we'll have to wait for the 10 o'clock

655
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,740
displacement and then you can look for a

656
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,720
silver bullet between 10 o'clock and 11

657
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,260
or you could use a run into

658
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,000
the launch macro which we won't talk

659
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,620
about tonight but I promise you I will

660
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,360
be teaching those things I can't do

661
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,640
everything in one lesson

662
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,400
everything line upon line preset the

663
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
phone precept it'll be taught here and

664
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,919
there

665
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,140
but before November you'll have more

666
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,600
than you'll ever need

667
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,640
so we have two ranges we've identified

668
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,880
here for defining where liquidity is

669
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,100
let me go back to discussion of that

670
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,640
book map application or software

671
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,740
I want you

672
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,279
if you have availability to do this

673
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,100
look at what bookmap is saying

674
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,320
when we're Trading

675
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,020
like here

676
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,539
tools like that will start showing you

677
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,940
lots of liquidity if they're accurate

678
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,520
right below that low

679
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,400
if it matches

680
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,740
if it matches the premise that I'm

681
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,320
teaching here tonight then it's valid

682
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,799
and that's where the market will draw to

683
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,620
every little small little liquidity

684
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,840
above the marketplace or below the

685
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,360
marketplace is irrelevant

686
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,220
when I say I'm looking for a draw on

687
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,159
liquidity I'm looking predominantly

688
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,740
around the levels I'm teaching you today

689
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,179
so think about how many times I've

690
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,820
called things on Twitter live

691
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,760
and how many times they were wrong

692
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
what three times Maybe

693
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,559
everything's on Twitter it's not deleted

694
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,940
it's not edited I don't do any of that

695
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,960
stuff

696
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,500
but all of you 300 000 plus now have

697
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,720
watched me take your attention to a

698
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,460
specific price point and then the market

699
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,840
ran off

700
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,640
it went right to it

701
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,220
how was I doing it it's what I'm

702
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,659
teaching you tonight

703
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,000
you can do this folks

704
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,500
now

705
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
there are going to be times when you

706
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,020
look at the market and it's not going to

707
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
be clear to you

708
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,020
if you don't have a clear depiction of

709
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,059
what should be taking place where the

710
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:30,900
market should draw to because there's

711
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,039
going to be times when I'm either going

712
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,480
to be on vacation or I'm not going to

713
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,380
Tweet or I'm not going to talk about

714
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,460
something

715
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm living a life

716
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,600
so if it's not clear to you what it's

717
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
reaching for

718
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
don't put a trade on study it and that

719
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,159
experience will grow over time and

720
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,900
you'll get better at doing it but when

721
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,279
you're journaling I want you to go in

722
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,159
your charts and journal like this

723
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,460
this should be part of your journaling

724
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,320
if you don't journal and you don't

725
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,880
record these types of things your brain

726
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,400
and your subconscious can't retain it it

727
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,559
needs to be trained and conditioned that

728
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,120
way it activates a reticular activating

729
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,559
system

730
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,840
so that way it allows your mind to see

731
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,039
it and when you're looking at Price

732
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,480
action live it'll be like oh I gotta

733
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,919
look oh there's that high I'm looking at

734
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,960
there's that low I'm looking at

735
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,640
notice we're cutting through candles

736
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,860
folks it's not supply and demand and

737
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,380
it's not Wyckoff I'm sorry

738
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,940
I wish it could be something I could

739
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,200
point to and say go every day and learn

740
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,520
that but it isn't anywhere else

741
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,720
all right opening range gaps

742
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,940
okay opening range gaps are a specific

743
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,919
event that takes place when you're

744
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,100
utilizing regular trading hours

745
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,000
so let's zoom in

746
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,760
so down here in trading view you want to

747
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,260
make sure you're toggled to regular

748
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,360
trading hours by doing that what it'll

749
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,980
do is it'll remove all the overnight

750
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,299
trading so you won't see anything like

751
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,279
London or anything like that

752
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,279
where we stop Trading

753
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,080
for the rate of trading hours

754
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,600
and when we start trading

755
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,460
again

756
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,860
at 9 30's opening bill that's what

757
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,460
you're seeing okay that separation that

758
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,039
is my opening range Gap so whenever you

759
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,980
hear me say an opening range Gap not to

760
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,340
be confused with opening range opening

761
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,740
range is the first 30 minutes I will

762
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,200
have a specific teaching in its entirety

763
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,240
all by itself on this video only on this

764
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,760
channel it'll be opening range lecture

765
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,159
but when I say opening range that is the

766
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,200
first 30 minutes after the opening belt

767
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,419
9 30. so specifically it's 9 30 a.m New

768
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,820
York local time to 10 a.m New York local

769
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,760
time not ambiguous as it folks very very

770
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,120
specific this opening range Gap is where

771
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,159
we stop trading using River Trading

772
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,240
hours

773
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,059
and when we open up at 9 30.

774
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,120
if there is a gap lower

775
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,580
at 9 30

776
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,100
you will see this Gap here it's being

777
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,020
shaded with this little Orange Box

778
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,899
it doesn't mean it wants to run up there

779
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,279
immediately

780
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,320
okay and this is what I watch a lot of

781
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,240
YouTubers that understand there are gaps

782
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,340
and I didn't invented the Gap but I did

783
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,799
codify some things around how to use

784
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,679
that Gap and I'll teach more about that

785
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,480
also in its own lesson

786
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
but tonight

787
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,380
I want you to think about how where the

788
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,539
market reaches for

789
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,580
liquidity

790
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,279
where it reaches for that liquidity and

791
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,020
where does it want to go to after it

792
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,419
goes there

793
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,760
this low over here

794
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,679
right in here

795
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,159
that low is occurring in the morning

796
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,679
session or the am session between 9 30

797
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,299
and noon

798
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,580
so we'll be residing below that

799
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,860
sell stops so we call that sell side

800
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,059
liquidity

801
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,340
so we Gap lower

802
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,679
and then run into that liquidity right

803
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,520
there

804
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,340
using regular trading hours

805
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,740
now if you're using electronic trading

806
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,760
hours

807
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,740
you may

808
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,860
have a lower low overnight and then in

809
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,000
other words between these two price

810
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,620
points here

811
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,020
where we close the registrating session

812
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,899
and open it regular trading session

813
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,940
between those two price points you have

814
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,419
all of the 6 pm to 9 30 in the morning

815
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,260
worth of trading that could have made a

816
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,880
lower low here

817
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,860
I don't care

818
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,659
what I don't care

819
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,399
if I'm going to refer to the opening

820
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,860
range Gap and we get a gap lower like

821
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
this I'm filtering out all of overnight

822
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,860
pricing that's it

823
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,919
now is that ambiguous

824
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,840
is that complicated

825
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,279
no

826
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,020
what low whatever you're looking at well

827
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,640
on regular trading hours on this chart

828
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,520
that's a pretty obvious low isn't it

829
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,200
that's the stuff I've been doing on

830
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,399
Twitter

831
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm picking the right highs and lows

832
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
folks because there's a method behind

833
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,860
what I'm doing I'm not inventing it as I

834
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,019
go I'm not going off on a whim making up

835
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,399
as I go I've been doing this stuff for

836
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,220
30 years it's the same stuff all the

837
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,039
time it's a well-written well-read novel

838
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,419
to me

839
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,399
that's why I'm so consistent that's why

840
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,260
I'm accurate and if you stick to these

841
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,659
rules you will become this accurate too

842
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,700
it's transferable

843
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,320
you should be excited I know somebody

844
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,640
you're grinning like right now he's

845
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,380
like man if I would have had this stuff

846
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,299
just a couple months ago I could have

847
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,799
passed my funded account challenge I

848
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,880
could have done this I could have done

849
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,159
that I could have bought a boat

850
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,440
a jet ski a car

851
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,580
a down payment on a house

852
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,419
but you have to go one step at a time

853
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,740
now

854
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,779
the opening range Gap

855
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,779
if we run to a portal code like this

856
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,260
here

857
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,580
wouldn't it make sense since we're now

858
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,760
into a discount and inside of liquidity

859
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,760
below old lows or in sell side now

860
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,560
we've already moved a lot from the

861
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,839
previous session here

862
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,379
here

863
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,619
what would be reasonable

864
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,239
well

865
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,699
look at that on my calendar

866
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,000
today we had the Fed chair pal jaw

867
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,099
booning at 10 o'clock in the morning

868
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,580
do we trade around pal or fed share

869
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,320
testimonies

870
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,820
no

871
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,099
not if you're new not if you're trying

872
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,418
to keep your money

873
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,799
now if you don't want to be a gambler

874
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
you wait

875
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,859
and you wait for what

876
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,359
the PM session

877
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,980
exactly what I said this morning on

878
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,418
Twitter

879
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,339
I said in Twitter I said today and

880
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,239
tomorrow

881
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,180
Fed chair will be testifying

882
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,580
so you want to be what

883
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,320
trading the afternoon if you're going to

884
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,180
trade it all the probabilities are going

885
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,500
to be high

886
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,599
in your favor if you wait till the

887
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,160
afternoon that means 1 30 in the

888
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,380
afternoon New York local time

889
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,900
to four o'clocks close

890
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,240
is that ambiguous

891
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,220
is that complicated

892
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,700
no

893
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,079
wouldn't you know it there's a low here

894
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,420
it forms at one o'clock

895
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,640
and then at 1 30 or so it creates

896
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,339
another low here

897
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,380
it's pretty interesting

898
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,859
what happens after that low forms

899
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,380
it runs right on up into that opening

900
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,880
range Gap

901
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
so all this mess in here

902
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,280
every Instagram Trader every Twitter

903
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,760
hero every YouTube Trader live streamer

904
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,260
they're in here trying to look for

905
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,980
patterns when there is nothing to trust

906
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,079
it's going to be running around going

907
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,400
amok

908
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,440
just seeking liquidity and it'll

909
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,079
frustrate you

910
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,460
that's the reason why I tell you to

911
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,140
focus on the sweet spots in the

912
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,339
marketplace

913
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,079
I don't care about retail Rick that's

914
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,220
going to come after the fact because

915
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,720
he's not going to tell you on Twitter

916
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,520
when I'm tweeting and saying oh you said

917
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,900
don't do this I'm going to go now and

918
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,579
trade it they don't ever do that

919
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,859
they'll come back two hours later

920
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,180
and they'll say look what I did over

921
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,280
here

922
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,700
so stop listening to those neophytes

923
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,099
the logic that I'm sharing don't take my

924
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,020
word for it go into the charts and you

925
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,640
will be convinced of it

926
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,000
100 guarantee I guarantee you you will

927
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,960
see this logic there

928
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,680
so it runs up in the opening range Gap

929
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,460
after

930
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,619
the New York lunch after the morning

931
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,119
session

932
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,339
chop

933
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,280
and it runs to a logical level

934
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,720
based on the information I've shown you

935
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,339
here

936
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,099
see in the morning

937
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,720
a lot of folks that understand this Gap

938
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
exists we're looking for any reason to

939
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,859
run right up there then no

940
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,960
they're not going to see it why because

941
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,180
they don't understand time the algorithm

942
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,140
runs on time

943
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,280
it Engineers liquidity in the morning

944
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
session and then it Engineers it going

945
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,960
into lunch and then it runs on that

946
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
liquidity

947
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,800
why would they want to do that we'll

948
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,400
talk about that

949
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,200
New York lunch raid

950
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,480
now

951
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,099
in the old days

952
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,740
and I was trading when the old days were

953
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,740
the thing before electronic Trading

954
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,440
we had open out cry pits and when you

955
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,480
called into the broker

956
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,800
they would answer the phone he had to

957
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,060
wait for them to answer the phone by the

958
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
way and then get transferred to the

959
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,099
trading desk that you are

960
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,380
seeing the account managers for that

961
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,119
account you have and you got to go

962
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,859
through the process of giving them your

963
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,260
account number and then your pin and

964
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,540
then you got to give them your order

965
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,520
they repeat the order the whole time the

966
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,680
Market's Trading

967
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,420
then they ask you if you want to wait

968
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,900
for your fill

969
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,920
and if you say I'm going to wait for my

970
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,940
fill

971
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,440
you're put on hold for a minute or two

972
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,700
then you come back and they tell you

973
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,780
confirmation number and where you were

974
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,280
filled

975
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,140
and many times you're upset because you

976
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,900
have real slippage

977
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,300
because you're all spoiled you press a

978
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,920
button you're in there right

979
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,240
and

980
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,420
the open outcry and the pits

981
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,900
would have a lunch hour where it was

982
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,220
very

983
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,140
almost like a routine unless it was a

984
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,180
big trending day

985
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,240
the lunch hour between noon

986
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,480
and 1 pm New York local time would

987
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,060
generally be a consolidation now the way

988
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,920
we could use that back then and I'm

989
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,020
going to show you how I use it now but

990
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,820
for historical purposes I'm giving you a

991
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,839
reference on how I become ICT

992
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,940
the lunch hour

993
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,420
many times was a reversal

994
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,740
and whatever took place in the morning

995
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,200
was completely reversed on and then if

996
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,400
it was a trending day it would just keep

997
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,020
on going and it would repeat whatever

998
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,060
the morning low was up the lunch high

999
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,160
and then run into three o'clock four

1000
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,420
o'clock and that would be their full

1001
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,040
Daily range

1002
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,960
other days if it was bullish it would go

1003
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,359
up and then consolidate during the 12

1004
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,619
o'clock and one o'clock in the afternoon

1005
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,359
and then do the same move in the

1006
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,220
afternoon between two o'clock and four

1007
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,300
o'clock that it did in the morning

1008
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,520
session but it would do it in half the

1009
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,020
time

1010
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,359
so it was a measured move ABCD type of

1011
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,060
profile

1012
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,800
and in other days you would see just a

1013
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,119
morning move and then consolidating

1014
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,800
launch and then stay Consolidated the

1015
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
rest of the day

1016
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,640
in the same thing if it was a bearish

1017
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,660
day it would create the morning move

1018
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,820
then consolidate in lunch and do nothing

1019
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,440
extra

1020
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,760
now it's pretty it that was pretty much

1021
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
it that was that was the profiles that

1022
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,180
existed back then

1023
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,320
now

1024
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,880
you might be thinking well that's all

1025
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,560
well and good Michael but which one do

1026
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,359
you use well which one would you expect

1027
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,280
based on the economic calendar

1028
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,660
the draw on liquidity for the weekly

1029
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,099
range what is it trying to do where's it

1030
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,720
reaching for

1031
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,119
all those things have to be balanced

1032
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,660
that still requires you and your study

1033
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,180
to get to that degree of um

1034
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,460
well understanding

1035
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,500
and implementing the things I'm teaching

1036
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,119
but you have no excuse when I'm pointing

1037
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,920
to it in advance I'm taking you to the

1038
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,180
higher time frame weekly charts I'm

1039
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,200
telling you where the Market's going to

1040
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,380
go and we watch it daily and weekly move

1041
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,260
thousands of points

1042
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,700
not five handles thousands

1043
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,000
hundreds okay so it gives you time

1044
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,160
an opportunity to get in sync with that

1045
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,599
type of moon you don't have to have the

1046
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,480
lowest low in the highest high

1047
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,540
so a New York lunch raid between noon

1048
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,700
New York local time to 1 30 pm

1049
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,079
but ICT you just said

1050
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,380
it's an hour long noon to 1 30. and

1051
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,400
there's people out there say oh the

1052
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,900
market doesn't care about nobody's going

1053
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,320
to lunch

1054
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,300
uh the algorithm

1055
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,280
doesn't take lunch but it runs on that

1056
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,900
liquidity

1057
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,859
so everything that was utilized

1058
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,440
since the dawn of Market manipulation

1059
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,619
when the powers that be

1060
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,800
figured out that they could just

1061
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,079
run a numbers game and everybody thinks

1062
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,400
it's a free market

1063
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
and they think it's buying and selling

1064
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,220
pressure that makes these markets go up

1065
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,060
and down and where they go

1066
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,760
they utilize that information that was

1067
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,400
not efficient at all when it was used in

1068
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,380
open outcry

1069
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,839
and that price

1070
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,900
that manipulation that engineering

1071
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,300
of Market Direction

1072
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,160
was made much more efficient when

1073
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
electronic trading took over

1074
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,579
so nothing has changed in regards to

1075
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,339
Market manipulation and Market making

1076
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,140
we're not talking about dealers folks

1077
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,940
okay if somebody's out there saying I'm

1078
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,560
a market maker I'm a former Market maker

1079
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,200
you are not a market maker you are a

1080
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,280
dealer

1081
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,660
the folks that are in control of price

1082
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,800
where it's going to go how high it's

1083
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
going to go how low it's going to go

1084
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,560
that's who I'm talking about and you

1085
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,440
don't see them they don't have a face

1086
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,420
all of that's been changed now in its

1087
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,240
algorithmic it's highly efficient they

1088
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,619
never get sick

1089
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,320
they never mess up because it's 100

1090
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,359
electronic

1091
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,000
it's following code it's following

1092
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,920
instructions

1093
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,060
period

1094
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,240
it's all delivered on time

1095
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,980
so a

1096
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,660
lunch

1097
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,040
run on liquidity a raid if you will

1098
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,079
you have to define the range

1099
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,339
between 12 o'clock and 1 30.

1100
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,099
but you said it's an hour long 130

1101
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,440
starts the PM session

1102
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,060
that's when the algorithm can start

1103
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,119
doing its macro a macro is a short order

1104
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,660
of instructions that will create an

1105
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,040
event in

1106
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,000
price delivery

1107
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
your focus needs to be on the highest

1108
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,760
high and the lowest low

1109
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,200
I'm showing you

1110
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,540
the highest high in

1111
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,520
12 to 1 o'clock

1112
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,260
because there's nothing higher than the

1113
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,079
high here

1114
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,240
the low formed here

1115
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,920
between 12 o'clock

1116
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,740
and 130 that's the lowest low here so we

1117
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,420
see this low it drops down there

1118
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,780
if we're expecting price to be bullish

1119
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,060
and it's not done anything in the

1120
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,079
morning

1121
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,800
Pals talking there's a afternoon event

1122
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,619
that's expected like fomc something to

1123
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:50,579
that effect

1124
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:53,460
you avoid the morning session let

1125
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,319
everybody else

1126
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,500
Chase everybody else's opinion

1127
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,020
in ignorance on social media everybody's

1128
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,520
looking for the the guy with the hot

1129
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,300
hand

1130
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,280
the guy that's doing all the trades the

1131
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,260
guy that knows or the gal

1132
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,940
indifference to the ladies that do

1133
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,800
Trading

1134
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,599
they're looking for the people that have

1135
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,920
something to say about the market right

1136
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,180
now and if they've been right in the

1137
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,619
past

1138
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,940
well damn it they're gonna be right

1139
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,460
today let me follow what they're doing

1140
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,020
no

1141
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,500
you trailblaze your own path using this

1142
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,140
information you will be confident that

1143
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,960
you have no requirement to be in

1144
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,660
anybody's membership or audience you'll

1145
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,000
be able to do this make your bread and

1146
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,960
then go live your life and do whatever

1147
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,760
you want to do not be chained to these

1148
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,140
charts not looking at what I'm doing on

1149
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,280
Twitter

1150
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,200
because in November and 2023 that's

1151
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,040
stops

1152
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,700
you have to do all these things on your

1153
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,480
own

1154
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,099
and that should not be scary it should

1155
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,240
be exciting

1156
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,280
I'm excited for you

1157
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,619
but the session hind session low for

1158
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,480
lunch hour

1159
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,800
well I guess it's really technically 90

1160
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,020
minutes isn't it

1161
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,720
do you said nine minutes oops

1162
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,319
laughs

1163
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,880
below here we can see it running down

1164
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,880
taking that when we're expected to go

1165
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,839
higher

1166
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,000
what do you think exists up here that's

1167
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,380
not being noted on the chart

1168
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,660
hmm

1169
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,940
we'll get back to that

1170
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,520
the market starts it's running 1 30.

1171
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,800
completely random now you're probably

1172
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,180
watching this video and you've never

1173
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,800
seen anything else by me or never listen

1174
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,119
to Twitter spaces that I've done

1175
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,839
and you don't know that I've said that

1176
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,780
time at 1 30. you don't know that I've

1177
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,140
said this many many times

1178
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,500
referring about the New York lunch

1179
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,140
and how there's an algorithm that

1180
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,000
controls price and there's a macro that

1181
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,339
begins at 130 that sets the tone and

1182
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:54,720
pace for the two o'clock to three

1183
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,339
o'clock Silver Bullet baby

1184
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,200
hmm

1185
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,400
the dots are starting to connect aren't

1186
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,900
they

1187
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,839
starting to see a little bit more

1188
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,819
of the tapestry

1189
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,220
that's a bit that's eluded you and

1190
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,540
everybody else out there that doesn't

1191
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,859
believe there's an algorithm doesn't

1192
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,480
believe that these markets are

1193
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,220
absolutely controlled by AI

1194
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,859
I promise you that's exactly what's

1195
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,160
going on

1196
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,380
we want to see when we're bullish the

1197
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,380
market dropped down and take out

1198
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,240
the New York lunch lows

1199
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,680
even if it's going to reverse

1200
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,520
you can trade that

1201
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,819
here

1202
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:53,640
how can you trade that

1203
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,700
wait for a shift in Market structure

1204
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,619
fair value Gap

1205
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,720
don't trust the five minute chart I've

1206
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,579
already shown you today using a 15

1207
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,760
second chart and we'll get to that too

1208
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,160
what do you say a 15 second chart yes

1209
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,160
yes friends and neighbors price is price

1210
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,960
and you have to look where the

1211
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,940
inefficiencies are and every retail

1212
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,680
Trader is using a 15-minute chart an

1213
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,319
hourly chart a four hour chart

1214
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,960
and there's this taboo around five

1215
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,119
minute charts or less because they're

1216
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,020
not informed they're not initiated

1217
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,819
they think it's noise

1218
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:32,040
they're probably the Goldman Sachs cult

1219
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,380
sorry boys but price is price and

1220
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,140
whatever you see in terms of measuring

1221
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,660
it using a time-based chart you have

1222
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,760
every advantage using a Time based chart

1223
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,079
in fact that's the only way you're going

1224
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,520
to see it

1225
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
so don't listen to people that say don't

1226
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,819
look at the time based chart it's

1227
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,400
nonsense wrong right away that tells you

1228
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,260
they have no idea

1229
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,140
algorithmic delivery it escapes them

1230
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,740
sorry

1231
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,859
it runs on time time is the first Factor

1232
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,839
what am i showing you here tonight

1233
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,240
very specific Windows of time and what

1234
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,760
to reference it in terms of liquidity go

1235
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,220
back and look at my examples folks your

1236
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,960
draw is going to hit the floor

1237
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,240
it's always been there

1238
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,760
and it's always been explained to you in

1239
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,220
this long-winded rants

1240
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,980
these stuff that you say I'm boring

1241
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,079
now I'm teaching you I'm trying to teach

1242
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,960
you everything that would bring you as

1243
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,599
close as I can bring you without having

1244
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,880
the third years experience I have so I'm

1245
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,540
I'm taking you fast track through three

1246
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,460
decades of understanding

1247
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,020
if you don't have the patience to sit

1248
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,640
through whatever the duration is for the

1249
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,020
lecture

1250
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,240
that's a little bit myopic

1251
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,400
and unrealistic you're selling yourself

1252
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,140
short I don't care if you learn it

1253
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,240
really and if you're going to be lazy I

1254
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,079
don't care

1255
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,819
but if you really want to learn it I'm

1256
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,319
telling you what to do

1257
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,599
I'm telling you what to avoid where your

1258
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,579
focus should be

1259
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,040
if you're bearish

1260
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,619
you can wait for

1261
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:12,480
a run up into the opening range Gap

1262
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,440
take out a lunch box out liquidity pool

1263
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,599
and then watch and see how it trades

1264
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,420
back below the New York lunch High

1265
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,800
if there's a displacement what does that

1266
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,660
mean

1267
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,700
see that low right here

1268
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,740
displacement

1269
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,839
what does it leave this candle is high

1270
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,740
and that candle's low what is that

1271
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,720
that's random look at that it's like

1272
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,760
it's this you know

1273
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,060
it has no Rhyme or Reason right wrong

1274
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,980
that's your 2022 model

1275
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,220
boom

1276
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,720
sell short

1277
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,920
aim for what ICT

1278
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,359
the New York lunch hello

1279
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,579
well it made this one here at one

1280
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,440
o'clock but you can use this one while

1281
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,540
you're long or bullish

1282
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,280
I know it looks cherry-picked and talked

1283
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,900
about I I promise I got something for

1284
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,980
you they're thinking that right now I

1285
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,160
promise you just sit tight but in the

1286
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,800
afternoon session you can see how that

1287
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,140
lunch hour plus 30 minutes that 90

1288
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,359
minute window

1289
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,980
that low right here is where sell side

1290
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,800
resides and in the PM session it reads

1291
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,020
that liquidity

1292
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,720
TT look man there's some relative equal

1293
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,040
lows down there and you teach relative

1294
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,319
equal O's right

1295
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,839
but before you get there where's the

1296
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,240
next logical

1297
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,980
rain to look for for in terms of

1298
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,619
liquidity that lunch hour or 90 minute

1299
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,339
period

1300
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,260
now

1301
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,819
I said a lot of talking about things

1302
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:52,440
that some of you get pissed off about

1303
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,540
because you think I'm some of my news

1304
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,920
that you're talking down to you but no

1305
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,780
I'm talking to you like a friend

1306
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,460
if you were friends with me from

1307
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,200
childhood this is exactly how I talk to

1308
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,940
you

1309
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,500
I know what I'm talking about

1310
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,839
I know how to make crazy ass profitable

1311
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,520
Traders

1312
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,140
but I also have students that are

1313
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,700
 lazy they're not going to do

1314
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,020
what I tell them to do and they're going

1315
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,819
to make excuses why they failed because

1316
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,319
they didn't listen and they rushed too

1317
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,319
fast to get into live Trading

1318
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,420
that's your mistake that's not my

1319
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,640
mistake in hiding things from you I

1320
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,200
didn't do that I'm not doing it here

1321
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,480
tonight either

1322
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,859
you have every Advantage after tonight

1323
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,200
going in looking at what I'm looking for

1324
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,420
where am I focusing

1325
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,640
I promise you after tonight your shit's

1326
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,500
gonna be different

1327
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,720
yes it's gonna have nuts

1328
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,440
am session ranges

1329
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,859
9 30 in the morning to noon

1330
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,740
so right away

1331
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,760
we are considering this in the afternoon

1332
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,800
so we can always refer to it in the same

1333
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,720
trading day

1334
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,460
so we could be anticipating a market

1335
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,960
reversal profile something to that

1336
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,140
effect

1337
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,920
if

1338
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,800
we have an elongated Market

1339
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,040
where say the New York session

1340
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,559
morning session rather of the current

1341
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,119
trading day

1342
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,760
is consolidation and then we have a

1343
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,339
directional lunch hour or during the

1344
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,440
lunch hour it's con in consolidation as

1345
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,760
well

1346
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,460
we can refer to and if we're bearish we

1347
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,920
look at the previous sessions trading

1348
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,619
now if you look at the previous session

1349
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,440
you're using electronic Trading

1350
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,160
what specific low am I looking for I'm

1351
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,260
looking at the 9 30 in the morning to

1352
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,700
noon

1353
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,260
if I'm not going to look at the PM

1354
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,359
session range remember I'm taking you

1355
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,059
through very specific pools of liquidity

1356
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:56,339
I'm going to look past

1357
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,740
the PM session

1358
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,800
well why would I do that because we're

1359
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,660
already trading below it over here

1360
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,520
so what I refer to it for sell side no

1361
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,500
we're already below it so if I'm bearish

1362
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,839
what am I looking for what low am I

1363
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,240
looking for what's drawn liquidity am I

1364
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,520
looking for

1365
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,740
in this regard I'm using the am session

1366
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,720
South Side liquidity

1367
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,160
if I was bullish it would be everything

1368
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,960
I just said here in reverse and opposite

1369
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,660
I would be looking for the buy side but

1370
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,160
if we're bearish

1371
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,500
I'm looking for a very specific pools of

1372
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,319
liquidity if I showed this on regular

1373
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,119
trading hours it would still get that

1374
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,380
low

1375
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,180
very important

1376
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,620
even though I'm showing you down here

1377
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,020
[Music]

1378
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,240
the electronic trading hours I'm doing

1379
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,800
this for the sake of under showing you

1380
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,380
and understanding that

1381
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,720
whether your chart is on regular trading

1382
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,640
hours or electronic trading hours and

1383
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,579
I'm looking at previous daily range or

1384
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,859
if I want to trade below yesterday's

1385
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:02,339
lows what low am I looking at

1386
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,460
the PM session low

1387
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,079
or

1388
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,880
the am session low

1389
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,420
very very specific not ambiguous not

1390
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,920
well I don't know which one he's looking

1391
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,540
at he's always changing around no

1392
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,220
I'm not it's always the same stuff

1393
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,220
always the same logic always the same

1394
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,480
logic

1395
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,700
what's changing is

1396
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,740
the profile that I'm operating in

1397
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,720
because the Market's delivering a

1398
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,780
specific way and I have to adapt to that

1399
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,059
and then I anticipate I'm not reacting

1400
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,220
to price I'm anticipating where it's

1401
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,720
going to run to

1402
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,339
what does that mean everything I'm

1403
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,559
teaching you tonight

1404
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,359
now I don't expect you to watch this

1405
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,640
tonight and walk away feeling like you

1406
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,960
know everything about what I just said

1407
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,920
you're gonna need to watch it a few

1408
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,900
times

1409
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,400
and if it's something you don't want to

1410
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,800
do you won't learn it

1411
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,599
I promise you you won't learn it one

1412
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,520
time watching it ain't gonna work you

1413
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,660
need to listen to what I'm saying in

1414
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,599
here and then go into your charts

1415
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,940
spend weeks and months going back

1416
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,380
through it

1417
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,540
that's what will convince you that this

1418
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,000
is Sound Logic it's not contrived it's

1419
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,579
not conjecture it's not made up

1420
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:14,339
it's absolutely what the market does

1421
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:16,800
every week

1422
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,300
every day

1423
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,680
and it will not stop

1424
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,180
so you can see the previous am session

1425
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,920
low over here south side liquidity this

1426
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,780
dotted line here the notes we're looking

1427
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,040
at the 20th of June 2023.

1428
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,280
so I can't use the afternoon session

1429
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,339
high and low because we've already

1430
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,200
starting at 9 30 we're already below

1431
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,339
that

1432
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,920
so what am I looking for ICT what am I

1433
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,920
supposed to be looking for

1434
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,540
that low

1435
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,119
it doesn't matter if it was a lower low

1436
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,920
okay

1437
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,940
listen

1438
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,579
if there was electronic trading hours

1439
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,440
showing and it had a lower low and it

1440
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,740
went below that low here I would still

1441
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,200
listen I would still

1442
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,599
refer to the PM session range as I

1443
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:07,800
mentioned a little bit ago in this

1444
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,420
presentation tonight

1445
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,300
and before that one I would go to this

1446
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,460
specific range here

1447
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,680
it's a Civic time

1448
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,440
I don't care about overnight highs and

1449
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,319
lows I'm looking at very specific

1450
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:24,660
regular trading hours

1451
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,160
regular trading hours is going to be

1452
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,460
referred to in the next trading session

1453
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,380
they're either going to be respected or

1454
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,180
blown out

1455
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,680
it's simple

1456
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,700
it's not hard

1457
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,660
all right so let's blend some things

1458
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,160
here okay

1459
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,380
so as you can see we have several things

1460
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,300
here in this chart and this is today's

1461
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,180
trading the 21st of June 2023 and it's

1462
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,619
the email s p

1463
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,040
and I photoshopped some things in here

1464
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,400
obviously being facetious by saying that

1465
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,980
the opening range as I taught you here

1466
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,960
tonight that was one of the factors I

1467
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,760
utilized today in the if you're

1468
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,140
following me on Twitter

1469
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,059
I showed my PM session trade which is

1470
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,540
what you're seeing here using everything

1471
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,619
that I talk to you tonight

1472
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,180
let's go through it okay

1473
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,420
this morning we are watching Fed chair

1474
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,920
pal

1475
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,380
give us testimony at 10 o'clock

1476
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,200
and I had my favorite Usual Suspects

1477
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,940
that I like following on Twitter not

1478
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,740
Twitter on YouTube rather

1479
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,140
and those that were live streaming I'll

1480
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,660
listen to them and

1481
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,960
no disrespect gentlemen and meme

1482
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,180
uh they had really no idea what was

1483
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,140
going on

1484
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,260
which is exactly what one would expect

1485
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,440
because the Market's gyrating and going

1486
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,000
sideways

1487
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,280
churning up accounts going sideways

1488
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,900
beating up everybody

1489
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,059
you have to wait

1490
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,819
until we get through lunch if that chair

1491
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:01,559
pal is going to talk

1492
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,780
and it's a 10 o'clock testimony or

1493
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,760
whatever

1494
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,980
wait wait for lunch

1495
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,819
wait for lunch

1496
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,740
if you do that

1497
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,440
you will get the cleanest setup for the

1498
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,400
day

1499
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,380
the easy what does that mean cleanest

1500
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,180
setup like what do you mean when you say

1501
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,420
that

1502
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,280
where everything just simply jumps off

1503
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,520
the chart it just it makes itself very

1504
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,339
obvious you want setups that are very

1505
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,880
obvious that's clean okay I don't want

1506
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,619
you as my student going into the

1507
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,000
marketplace and trying to just be an

1508
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,059
action hound and try to trade everything

1509
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,339
I don't teach my students to do that

1510
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,140
the ones that blow their accounts or

1511
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,880
fail their funded account challenges

1512
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,339
that's a characteristic that they have

1513
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,440
that is not a

1514
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,960
a derivative of learning from me

1515
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,839
that's a personal character flaw

1516
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,059
and you can correct it you can fix it

1517
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:03,059
but you can't place that blame on me

1518
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:06,240
if you wait and you listen I counsel all

1519
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,960
of you real real time live on Twitter

1520
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,660
don't touch this right now

1521
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,900
all right focus on this time of the day

1522
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,460
and when it's appropriate I'll point to

1523
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,900
where the Mark's going to go to next I

1524
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,380
did that today

1525
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,240
the opening range Gap here

1526
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,940
was utilized to get what would otherwise

1527
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,799
be done if you had

1528
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:33,900
done these same entries and managed at

1529
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,420
the same position would have resulted in

1530
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,579
a 9

1531
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:41,160
362.50 before commissions

1532
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,900
now I don't know about you where you are

1533
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,460
in the world and you know you're walking

1534
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,579
life but the almost ten thousand dollars

1535
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:49,200
is a pretty respectable amount of money

1536
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,880
I mean you can go on a nice vacation

1537
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,960
with that

1538
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,540
can get your spouse something really

1539
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,920
nice you probably do some really good

1540
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,500
Christmas shopping with that so that's

1541
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,420
not chump change

1542
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,180
and I want to think about the logic

1543
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,400
that's shown here

1544
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,619
pal

1545
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:09,420
10 o'clock

1546
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,559
trash Market okay just ignore it

1547
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,599
just ignore it just don't even worry

1548
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,000
about it oh but it's gonna run it's

1549
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,599
gonna move that is you that's a neophyte

1550
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,500
Trader

1551
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,500
and an action Hound you feel like you

1552
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,119
have to be able to do something in that

1553
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,700
I'm telling you I'm telling you with 30

1554
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,900
years of experience you don't need to

1555
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,059
you don't need to it's liberating when

1556
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,319
you just relax and say you know what

1557
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,940
this is the highest degree of

1558
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,119
manipulation right now and you don't I

1559
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:44,400
don't know what they're gonna do because

1560
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,619
they can manually intervene and send

1561
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:49,740
price careening higher or lower and you

1562
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,480
won't be able to

1563
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,339
see it coming

1564
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:55,920
so don't torture yourself do something

1565
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,180
else sleep in

1566
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,160
go have breakfast with your spouse work

1567
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,599
out longer

1568
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,859
take your boat out Roger jet skis

1569
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:10,920
cut the grass whatever don't do don't do

1570
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,200
anything in the marketplace just wait

1571
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,520
and then what time does your shift start

1572
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,380
at 1 30.

1573
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,140
that's when the macro will start running

1574
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:27,119
at 1 30 the market creates a a low here

1575
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,680
Market trades down below

1576
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,900
the New York lunch South Side liquidity

1577
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,400
again

1578
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,559
they can sweep it again but notice it

1579
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,059
doesn't take that lower here I don't

1580
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:41,720
require it to

1581
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,059
the logic is it's going down there once

1582
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:46,260
more

1583
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,640
just in case

1584
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,200
rallies

1585
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,480
comes back down into this down closed

1586
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,700
candle which is a bowl of shoulder block

1587
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,440
I'm not teaching order blocks in this

1588
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,920
lecture

1589
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,599
the market rallies we have displacement

1590
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,920
again

1591
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,500
fair value gaps and whatnot I promise

1592
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,540
you I'm going to take you into a 15

1593
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,099
second

1594
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,500
chart where I utilize the information

1595
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,599
I'm going to show you here what I saw

1596
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,700
was the market drop down below

1597
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,940
the initial New York lunch sell side

1598
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,619
liquidity

1599
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,960
it's dropping down below here and then

1600
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,260
I'm anticipating it to go up into the

1601
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,880
opening range Gap that's this shaded

1602
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,859
area up here

1603
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:34,020
I don't need to show you an example

1604
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,579
where it goes all the way up there I'm

1605
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:37,260
teaching you low hanging fruit that's

1606
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,780
the first threshold for you to learn

1607
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,579
under my wing

1608
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,579
you can and you can see it tonight the

1609
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:47,460
logic is leave a partial on for that

1610
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,160
but I'm trying to encourage you while

1611
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,760
you're learning to learn how to do this

1612
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,859
modularly step by step you're not going

1613
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,619
to go out there and do you know a lot of

1614
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:00,839
contracts in one time you won't know how

1615
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:01,799
to do the pyramiding that you're going

1616
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:04,200
to watch me do here in a moment

1617
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,940
you're not going to know all that stuff

1618
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,260
okay and to remove all of the oh man I

1619
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,359
wish I would have had a

1620
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,579
partial on I wish I would have held it

1621
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:15,540
longer

1622
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,819
you don't know where your growth is

1623
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:18,900
going to be and how long it's going to

1624
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,700
take you to get to a point where you can

1625
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,700
trust doing that so I allow for and I

1626
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,579
build into my teaching room for you to

1627
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:28,920
develop independent from my

1628
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,660
personal timing

1629
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,000
see what I think a student should

1630
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,180
require in terms of learning may be more

1631
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,619
or less than what it's going to require

1632
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,119
for you

1633
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,940
so I'm trying to be a realistic Mentor

1634
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,400
not just someone that says go through my

1635
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,839
workshop go through my training in this

1636
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,160
many days months weeks or whatever

1637
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,960
you're going to come out knowing what it

1638
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,160
is you're going to do and if you can't

1639
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,700
then you suck that's just not practical

1640
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,760
so what I do is I teach you where the

1641
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,619
Market's going to go what is your

1642
01:03:58,619 --> 01:03:59,819
terminus

1643
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:02,640
Terminus while you're first learning is

1644
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,680
the easiest low-hanging fruit objective

1645
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,020
so if we're buying

1646
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,280
down here

1647
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,960
on the basis that that sell side

1648
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,240
liquidity pool for lunch

1649
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,579
has been swept here and we see this

1650
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:18,839
returning but not respecting

1651
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:21,660
a run into and below that low it's

1652
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,760
denying that and it showed a willingness

1653
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,760
to repel back above this low that's what

1654
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,500
I was looking through all of this lows

1655
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,000
here I'm looking past all that going

1656
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,799
right to that low right there remember

1657
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:34,440
this low here doesn't get taken out

1658
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,140
until the PM session

1659
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,119
look at your chart yeah I mentioned it

1660
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,540
earlier

1661
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,000
this low I trusted it but Michael what

1662
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,319
happens if it went down there then I

1663
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,660
would have got stopped out

1664
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,359
what yeah sometimes I get it wrong

1665
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,520
sometimes I mess it up sometimes I bring

1666
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,000
the baggage okay the scar tissue or my

1667
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,799
ego into it and I try to outperform my

1668
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,020
own algorithm

1669
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,700
and I get my ass handed to me I get

1670
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,740
stopped out if the trade's still valid

1671
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,119
I'll go back in and re-enter you've

1672
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,099
watched me do that I've recorded myself

1673
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:09,780
doing that

1674
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,240
go on Twitter it's there

1675
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,079
it's there

1676
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,000
if I get it wrong you see it if I get

1677
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,740
stopped out you see it if I get stopped

1678
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,880
out and it's still a good trade I'll get

1679
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,140
back in if I get stopped out and I'm

1680
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,240
done I'm done

1681
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,500
I don't hide that from you

1682
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,440
so I'm buying Under the premise that

1683
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,240
we're returning into that South Side

1684
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,260
liquidity here one more time

1685
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,180
what is it doing here though if it's not

1686
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,000
taking out that low what is it doing

1687
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,440
it's trading below the rejection block

1688
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,540
which is the lowest closing price in

1689
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,980
this swing

1690
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,099
I don't need that low to be taken out I

1691
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,380
don't want to see it taken out

1692
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,720
so all the understanding of price action

1693
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,880
over here I'm anticipating this

1694
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,280
accumulation

1695
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,260
and smart money jumping on board like I

1696
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,380
was to run to

1697
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,420
relative equal highs and more

1698
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,579
specifically inside the opening range

1699
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:10,920
from record trading hours where we stop

1700
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,780
Trading

1701
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,040
and where we started Trading

1702
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:22,859
42 22 and a half

1703
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:25,140
that's this high in here

1704
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,599
I could have very easily had a runner

1705
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,240
run up in here and try to get one tick

1706
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,240
below the high of the opening range Gap

1707
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,520
but if I do those types of things you

1708
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,339
already some of you already

1709
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:40,440
get pissed off at your own performance

1710
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,880
because you think you should have 30

1711
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,559
years of experience and performance and

1712
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,059
results too because you've watched my

1713
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,240
videos or you spent enough time which

1714
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,039
isn't realistic because none of you

1715
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,559
spend enough time to do what I'm doing

1716
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,260
it's not ego it's not it's not arrogance

1717
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,539
it's it's real

1718
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:00,660
practicality I mean think about it folks

1719
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,579
I may have 30 years of experience but I

1720
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:04,559
can't Pour That Into You in a short

1721
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,760
period of time and you have 30 years

1722
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,380
experience too

1723
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,900
it's unrealistic

1724
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,760
and some of you are very hard on

1725
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,140
yourselves and you think that you should

1726
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,240
be able to do what I do

1727
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,539
so I try to teach with that in mind and

1728
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:22,079
I teach low hanging for those terms are

1729
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,180
my way of saying okay

1730
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,619
to go higher

1731
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:27,720
where is it going to go to logically

1732
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,180
well if it's taken sell side out here

1733
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,680
that means the sell stocks have been

1734
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,079
rated there and we swept down into the

1735
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,839
rejection block and preserve that low

1736
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:38,940
in the afternoon should see a run up

1737
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,380
into

1738
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,480
that Gap and for those that are on you

1739
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,920
know wondering why should that happen

1740
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,480
and not take out the relative equal lows

1741
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,700
is because we've already worked below

1742
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,760
that am session low remember before we

1743
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,200
trade into the well not trade the

1744
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,299
transitions into this slide here we

1745
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:55,799
traded into the previous session am

1746
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:58,559
loves so we are really in a deep

1747
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:59,880
discount

1748
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,579
in that opening range Gap has not been

1749
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,640
traded into from the open it opened and

1750
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,339
ran away from it quickly it's never came

1751
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,980
up to it until here

1752
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,079
and it left what relative equal highs

1753
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:14,579
what time of the day did it do it

1754
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,920
between 12 o'clock and 1 30.

1755
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,040
so that's your lunch buy side liquidity

1756
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,420
everybody that's short thinks it's going

1757
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,219
to keep going down that's where their

1758
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:26,520
stop loss is who's doing that funds

1759
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,920
not retail Rick

1760
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,380
large funds Deep Pockets

1761
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:38,460
buying and every time the market gave me

1762
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,920
a buying opportunity very specific PD

1763
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,000
arrays

1764
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,060
on a 15 second chart

1765
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,859
I was entering this is a one minute

1766
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,120
chart by the way if you're looking at it

1767
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,279
here it's one minute every one of these

1768
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:53,339
entries were based on a 15 second candle

1769
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:55,380
I recorded it I've already shared it on

1770
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,399
Twitter but for the folks that don't

1771
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,120
have

1772
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,040
Twitter or refuse to watch it because

1773
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,600
they don't want to be on the Bird app or

1774
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,299
whatever I got you covered tonight

1775
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:05,698
but every time it reached above relative

1776
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:08,819
equal highs I'm taking a partial profit

1777
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:12,479
up in here another partial profit

1778
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,819
Above This High here partial profit and

1779
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:18,120
above the high here partial profit

1780
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,880
so I don't require

1781
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,640
it to trade above this high

1782
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,859
and I'm teaching you that you don't need

1783
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,198
to do that either I mean if you got out

1784
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,500
just with this 44 22 and a half that's

1785
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,839
below

1786
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:37,500
the actual liquidity above this high

1787
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,319
and if you mimic this same trade in your

1788
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,880
own account whether it be funded or in

1789
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,439
life funds and you profited 9 362.50 are

1790
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:47,399
you going to beat yourself up because

1791
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,198
you didn't have that run up um to the

1792
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,819
opening range Gap High

1793
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,040
some of you might and that would be

1794
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,480
unfortunate that's not what I want you

1795
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,300
to think that would be really a toxic

1796
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,699
mindset about your performance and what

1797
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,560
you're trying to do you try very very

1798
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,620
hard to filter out negative thinking

1799
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,360
that's why social media is the worst

1800
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,160
social media is like cancer

1801
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,020
okay for a developing student because

1802
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,760
everybody's got an ego they're all

1803
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,199
pulling their dicks out for a measuring

1804
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,540
competition okay and the point is you're

1805
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,620
trying to learn how to make money and

1806
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,300
all I'm trying to do is teach you how to

1807
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,159
stay in the game long enough

1808
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,020
so you can keep your money learn the

1809
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,520
skills that's on showing you so that way

1810
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,900
you can leave your job and then

1811
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,920
live your life and do whatever you want

1812
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,659
to do okay and you don't need to listen

1813
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:29,580
to me the rest of your life I don't I

1814
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,020
don't want to be doing these videos I'm

1815
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,120
going to be doing it so I'm leaving you

1816
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,500
a legacy so that way you can come back

1817
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,940
to this information take your kids to

1818
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,920
this information whatever and build

1819
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,500
Legacy wealth you don't need you don't

1820
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,780
need to entertain these people's egos

1821
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,060
you don't need to come back and keep me

1822
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,280
feeling good about myself either

1823
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,500
this stuff works

1824
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,179
but you have to graduate in your

1825
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:52,679
understanding about where is it going to

1826
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:54,900
go and be realistic

1827
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,000
and then over time when you start seeing

1828
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,860
this unfold

1829
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,199
reasons for it to go higher

1830
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,960
you leave a runner on

1831
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,600
that's the only way if you're in there

1832
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,920
trading and you're thinking to yourself

1833
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,620
man I don't know I should probably leave

1834
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,179
a runner on there I know if I leave a

1835
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:13,739
runner on you know it's probably gonna

1836
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,900
you know stop me out and if I don't put

1837
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,760
one on it's going to run oh put one on

1838
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,080
what's the worst thing gonna happen it's

1839
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,940
going to stop you out in profit

1840
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:24,179
see you're wrestling with being right

1841
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:25,980
and many of you are trying to do that if

1842
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,020
you're doing it in front of an audience

1843
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,580
that is hard

1844
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,980
because not only are you wrestling with

1845
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,080
your internal dialogue about what you

1846
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,280
should do and how you're managing the

1847
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,960
trade but you're inviting everybody

1848
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,179
else's feedback to your trade and guess

1849
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:40,140
what

1850
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,900
guess what girl boy that's not your

1851
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,239
trade anymore you've invited the entire

1852
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:46,739
Community that's watching you and your

1853
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,140
audience to manage your trade for you

1854
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,540
and that means you brought in a level of

1855
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:56,460
uncertainty fear Pride

1856
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,040
and pain that would otherwise not be

1857
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,480
there if you were disquietied about what

1858
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,280
the you're doing

1859
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,140
that's what this is all about folks it's

1860
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,640
not about getting out there and Showboat

1861
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,960
Showboat and show what you can do

1862
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,120
improve this improve that

1863
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,739
is it going to matter

1864
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:13,080
when you're paying off a house

1865
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,600
how many people believe you did it

1866
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,980
how many are going to have to come back

1867
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,960
here on social media when you hit seven

1868
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,179
figures and you're a millionaire how

1869
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:22,560
many of you have to come back to social

1870
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,960
media and go to the usual suspect and

1871
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,480
say haha ICT made me a millionaire

1872
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,520
if you think that you're doing this

1873
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,500
for the wrong reasons

1874
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,679
the people that are really killing it

1875
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:36,900
they don't come on Twitter

1876
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,460
they don't leave comments in my section

1877
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,719
of my videos

1878
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:41,460
they don't do any of that stuff they're

1879
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,260
out there living a life

1880
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,940
they've already thanked me they've

1881
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,560
already shared their testimony and

1882
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,760
they're doing big wheel

1883
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,820
grow like that

1884
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,780
all right so uh

1885
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,420
this is a

1886
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,179
15 second chart

1887
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:08,460
and

1888
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,199
I have to make sure that I don't play

1889
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,179
sound on this and I gotta make sure

1890
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,500
I do this correctly here

1891
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,179
I recorded a song as I typically do on

1892
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,540
Twitter I love Twitter for that reason

1893
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,179
it's like a like a a text message to you

1894
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:29,100
like if you had my personal phone number

1895
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,420
and yeah so there's a lot of people that

1896
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,100
have it and yes they abuse it

1897
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,600
and yes I'm changing my phone number in

1898
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,699
November

1899
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:36,960
a lot of you

1900
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,840
that listen to me or follow me on

1901
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,600
Twitter when I'm tweeting that's the

1902
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,159
same thing if you were like my best

1903
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,560
friend and I'll say hey look at the look

1904
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,960
at this Market here that's that's real

1905
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,659
time right now right from my mind right

1906
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:53,159
into Twitter

1907
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:56,400
and I can't put the music on

1908
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,679
in the in a presentation format that I

1909
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,060
love doing over the years I used to be

1910
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,040
on Twitter uh before leaving it they

1911
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,980
started censoring me and I left it and I

1912
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,300
came back

1913
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,320
and one of the things I was looking

1914
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,060
forward to was going back and doing

1915
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,980
vignettes where I record myself

1916
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,080
executing putting on trade putting a

1917
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,360
stop loss on managing it for you know

1918
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,679
putting on a pyramid position building

1919
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:19,020
it up taking profits and watching the

1920
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,140
position go from beginning to end and I

1921
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,880
usually put a song on there it may not

1922
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,320
be the type of song that you like it may

1923
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,239
have foul language in it it may be a

1924
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:28,679
genre that you don't like I don't give a

1925
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:30,960
 because it's what I like okay I

1926
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,880
like doing that because it's what I like

1927
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,140
doing

1928
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,480
it's usually received well in the

1929
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,640
community but I can't play that here

1930
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,739
because I'll get a copyright strike and

1931
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:43,620
I I don't need all that here so

1932
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,900
I'll leave a link so you can look at it

1933
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,060
in the format that I gave on Twitter but

1934
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,080
you don't need it's gonna be the same

1935
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,440
thing here

1936
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,760
as a reminder every Candlestick you're

1937
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,080
seeing here is a 15 second duration now

1938
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,960
think about that lunch sell side

1939
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,300
liquidity pool and where the market was

1940
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,460
going to go up to now right now you're

1941
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,020
looking at the dollar Index

1942
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,300
it's going to change over to index

1943
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,400
features but I want you to think about

1944
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,739
what I showed you before we got to this

1945
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:15,179
slide here

1946
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:17,040
because when the when the video starts

1947
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,440
playing it's like two minutes long and

1948
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,600
I'll walk you through as much as I can

1949
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,760
but everything that has already been

1950
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,100
told to you tonight that's what I was

1951
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,239
using

1952
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:30,239
okay I promise you I didn't have

1953
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,900
something secret okay everything that I

1954
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,820
taught you tonight is exactly what I

1955
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,739
implemented here and everything I'm

1956
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:39,239
commenting and annotating in the chart

1957
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:42,659
real time as I'm recording it

1958
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:45,300
that's what I was seeing so I try to do

1959
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,400
as much as I can in terms of annotating

1960
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,900
the chart showing the reference points

1961
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,980
where I think the Mark's going to be

1962
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,000
respecting

1963
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,040
certain levels why it should behave a

1964
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,000
certain way

1965
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,120
keeping in mind that I'm doing this

1966
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,380
with 15 second candlesticks so I have to

1967
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,300
know what the I'm talking about to

1968
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,500
be able to do this

1969
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,120
to be able to annotate it show you where

1970
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,380
the rivals are going to be respected and

1971
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,580
I was going to reach out to this and do

1972
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,280
it think about seriously seriously folks

1973
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,820
think about what would be necessary to

1974
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,100
be able to know what's going on if

1975
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,179
you're just simply looking at the 15

1976
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:19,679
second chart like everybody else on

1977
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,900
Twitter was doing today

1978
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,760
and they watched it and look at the

1979
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,640
comment section like what the heck what

1980
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,320
the hell's going on how what 15 seconds

1981
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,080
forget the time frame

1982
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,360
forget the time frame think about what

1983
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,500
I've told you tonight with the lunch

1984
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,760
macro

1985
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,860
it's running down to the sell side and

1986
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,239
it's going back up into that opening

1987
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,460
range Gap to take the buy side on the

1988
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,620
New York lunch High where the buy side

1989
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,580
is

1990
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,440
that's all that I'm doing and I'm gonna

1991
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,940
use every PD array that is discount

1992
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,219
I'm gonna put in every every one of

1993
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:54,659
these things could have been your

1994
01:16:54,659 --> 01:16:56,159
individual entry

1995
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,960
based on the things I've taught just

1996
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,239
using a 15 second chart

1997
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,920
now there's other things if you were

1998
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,900
looking at a one minute chart

1999
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,420
the far less entries obviously but you

2000
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,520
could see certain entry patterns or PD

2001
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,820
arrays to get into the trades

2002
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,560
based on a one minute chart two minute

2003
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,060
three minute four or five

2004
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,260
or

2005
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,760
a 15-minute chart

2006
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,340
but you have less entry opportunities

2007
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,100
the higher time frame get you go

2008
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,620
so this to add insult to injury for the

2009
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,000
people that say this is and

2010
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,460
it's fake and all this other stuff I go

2011
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,560
into these Ultra short-term time frames

2012
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,540
just to Overkill

2013
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,420
just to rub their nose in it to show you

2014
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,239
that this stuff works and it will work

2015
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,400
for you it ain't gonna work for you the

2016
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,540
first time you watch the video it ain't

2017
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,739
gonna be working for you because you've

2018
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,480
watched a couple videos and you wrote a

2019
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,560
couple sentences down you think that's

2020
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,699
journaling you're gonna have to really

2021
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:49,500
roll your sleeves up and dig into this

2022
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,440
stuff and study it it's a lifestyle if

2023
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,880
you don't make it a lifestyle forget

2024
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,280
about it it's it's not going to work for

2025
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,380
you you have to be passionate about it

2026
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,480
all right so I'm going long here on the

2027
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,179
S P here's that uh

2028
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,580
run that didn't take out the low at one

2029
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,780
o'clock

2030
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,880
and I'm adding a pyramiding and I've

2031
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,620
already annotated that fair value Gap

2032
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,239
and told you that it's an inversion for

2033
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:16,260
everybody you got that means it's going

2034
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,340
to go above it

2035
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,620
treated as support and then rally up

2036
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,820
into the buy sides that I'm going to

2037
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,320
show you here

2038
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,540
so you can already see that 4422 even

2039
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,460
level is highlighted as a bicycle

2040
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,880
liquidity notice it's below that high

2041
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,679
I'll show you when we're covering the

2042
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,580
lunch

2043
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,340
liquidity so that's the order Block it's

2044
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,239
reclaimed and it dug into the uh

2045
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,800
inversion fair value Gap and for the

2046
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,880
folks that thinking all the order block

2047
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,800
doesn't work see here that entire range

2048
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,540
is the order block

2049
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,400
and I'm adding into it here inside the

2050
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,780
fair value Gap that is already

2051
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,219
identified as an inversion for your

2052
01:18:50,219 --> 01:18:51,360
value Gap

2053
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,860
so this is going to be dynamic support

2054
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:56,360
here watch how it respects it

2055
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,580
I'm already showing you here it's going

2056
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,080
to go up

2057
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,239
and just like magic on a 15 second chart

2058
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,620
look at that

2059
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,659
it's unbelievable isn't it now my stop

2060
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,360
loss is below the inversion favorite you

2061
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,199
got and I'm showing you where the

2062
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:11,640
executions are so everything matches now

2063
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,560
folks this is not replay none of that

2064
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,980


2065
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,020
here's another partial here

2066
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,159
and my stop is below the low at 44.16. I

2067
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,360
don't want to chase it up there because

2068
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,520
that's inefficient

2069
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,620
it can trade down inside that so I don't

2070
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,719
want to put a stop loss at 44.17 in half

2071
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:35,880
it can come back in there deeper I'm

2072
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,400
making allowance for that so my stop is

2073
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,199
staying below that

2074
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:42,600
I'm not in a hurry to guarantee higher

2075
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,520
profits I'm more concerned about my

2076
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,920
limit orders filling my stop is not

2077
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,580
being concerned about

2078
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,420
and here comes another

2079
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,300
run up into a

2080
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,340
10 lot limit order

2081
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:02,040
that would put me at 5 remaining

2082
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,280
see that retracement down in there

2083
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,960
I'm not worried about that you might be

2084
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,159
freaking out because you put your stop

2085
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,440
loss higher or you maybe even stopped

2086
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,040
out

2087
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,659
but this is proper stop loss management

2088
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:14,219
now here's the limit order and then now

2089
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:15,239
we're going to run for that buy side

2090
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,480
here

2091
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,460
and then once it runs that high I'm

2092
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,679
holding the trail my stop loss up then

2093
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:24,540
this is exactly what I shared on Twitter

2094
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:25,560
today

2095
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,300
everything was recorded this is not

2096
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,060
Market replay this is not uh the trading

2097
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,520
view replay none of that stuff

2098
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,300
okay the logic that I showed here

2099
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,820
doesn't

2100
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,320
show everything that I taught tonight

2101
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,880
but what I was utilizing because you

2102
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,460
don't hear me talking in in the trade

2103
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,920
but the things that I'm doing to trade

2104
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,659
this

2105
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:51,239
everything I'm doing is what I was

2106
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:53,219
teaching you tonight

2107
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:55,860
it's not conjecture I didn't form fit it

2108
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,320
I do this stuff every single week with

2109
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,520
you all on Twitter

2110
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,500
over and over and over again and when

2111
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,000
time permits it I'll give an example

2112
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,100
every single day today I gave several

2113
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,179
examples

2114
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:08,219
this one today I told you to wait for

2115
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:09,540
the PM session that was the morning

2116
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,860
advice

2117
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,679
and I went in there and murdered it

2118
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,100
so every single one of these individual

2119
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,140
entries

2120
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,840
that could be your model

2121
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,940
some are better in terms of where their

2122
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,860
entry was but I'm using them as

2123
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,320
pyramiding opportunities

2124
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,320
none of the things in here that I showed

2125
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,500
violated any of the bullish order flow

2126
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,800
this is real order flow notice there's

2127
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,219
no Dom depth of Market level two data

2128
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:45,540
required no book map required everything

2129
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,880
that I've outlined here is shown to you

2130
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,420
on a time-based chart my partials are

2131
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,239
based on liquidity look at my exits on

2132
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,060
the partials they're at the highs

2133
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,540
my entries are in very key levels that

2134
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,699
would be a discount array for what I've

2135
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:05,400
taught you and I've done so on a 15

2136
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,159
second chart that's not even a minute it

2137
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,600
takes four of these individual handles

2138
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,980
to make one minute

2139
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,620
does it look like noise to you look at

2140
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,300
how the market reacted

2141
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,719
right there I time traveled folks I time

2142
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,480
traveled when we were down here I drew

2143
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,340
this out and labeled it in version

2144
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,719
Fairbank app for the folks that have

2145
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,640
been following me for the last couple

2146
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,640
weeks of the month or so probably two

2147
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,800
months I introduced the inversion

2148
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,060
Fairbank account

2149
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,760
okay so every one of my PD arrays can be

2150
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,360
utilized as a contrain entry

2151
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,159
but unless you have the narrative in

2152
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:42,480
mind knowing where is it going to reach

2153
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,739
for where's the liquidity it's going to

2154
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:45,120
be drawing price next

2155
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,860
how do you know how do you know that ICT

2156
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:50,219
well you started with the weekly candle

2157
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:52,260
where is it going to gravitate to I

2158
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,780
don't care if you use another way of

2159
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,480
trading folks I don't care if you do

2160
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,060
trade with harmonic patterns okay if you

2161
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,860
use what I'm teaching here tonight it's

2162
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,780
going to make your start working

2163
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,580
the times that it fails it's going

2164
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,380
against what I'm teaching you tonight I

2165
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,300
promise you that is not arrogance or

2166
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,120
Pride or ego speaking your ain't

2167
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,300
working when it goes against this

2168
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,060
if you trade retail concepts with this

2169
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,739
stuff your retail ship will start

2170
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:21,659
working

2171
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:23,340
you don't have to like me

2172
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,480
okay you don't have to tell everybody

2173
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,600
that you trade SMC or ICT or whatever

2174
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,120
 you want to call me okay I don't

2175
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,159
care I really don't care

2176
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,080
but I really want to see you succeed

2177
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,060
even if you hate my guts and you

2178
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,440
troll me you make videos about me and

2179
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,420
all about I don't care I'm not

2180
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,400
losing any sleep okay I can

2181
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,900
still do this stuff whether you love me

2182
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,760
or hate me

2183
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,159
and I really want you to listen

2184
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:49,440
and you never ever ever have to tell me

2185
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,920
that it improved your Trading

2186
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,420
I don't need it

2187
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,440
I know it works

2188
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,140
I want you to think about

2189
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,239
everything I talked about tonight

2190
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,940
and how it gives you a plethora

2191
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,100
of opportunities that will always be

2192
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,060
there

2193
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,600
folks these intervals they happen every

2194
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,340
day

2195
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,659
and guess what

2196
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,400
they can't hide it

2197
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,560
they cannot hide this information from

2198
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,239
you it doesn't require any kind of

2199
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:23,159
subscription to any thing it

2200
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,880
doesn't require you to do anything extra

2201
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,440
it's simply just looking at the time

2202
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,360
intervals where is that pool of

2203
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,520
liquidity above and below and where does

2204
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,860
it fit in a narrative I'm guiding you

2205
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,080
I'm teaching you but teach me bias ICT

2206
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,960
this is all part of it

2207
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,420
it's all part of it

2208
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,159
go back and look at the tweets I've told

2209
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,560
you the focus on the PM session what is

2210
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,940
that 1 30 to 4 o'clock

2211
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,440
think

2212
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,659
how many opportunities

2213
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,239
are going to be much more Within Reach

2214
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,620
for you now

2215
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,300
because you have this understanding in

2216
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,980
price

2217
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,179
it doesn't mean you're going to be able

2218
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:08,100
to go out and do it tomorrow remember I

2219
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,780
said in this lecture tonight that you

2220
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,239
have to go through weeks and months of

2221
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,420
back testing studying what it's done

2222
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,600
logging it journaling it and encouraging

2223
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,420
yourself in the commentary in the chart

2224
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,400
that you screenshot that you put into

2225
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,020
your journal and you talk to yourself

2226
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,820
like you knew it was going to happen in

2227
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,679
advance and you're tricking your

2228
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:30,719
subconscious into believing that is

2229
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,760
experience and because you're

2230
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,560
sugarcoating it with everything positive

2231
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,580
and you're never saying anything

2232
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,940
negative when you watch real-time price

2233
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:41,760
it won't feel scary subconsciously if

2234
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,560
you've always looked at Price action or

2235
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,000
looked at people like me or other people

2236
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,219
that you think are fraud scammers or

2237
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:48,540
they don't really know how to trade or

2238
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,760
whatever you are literally

2239
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,480
flooding your brain with toxicity

2240
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,280
and I guarantee you probably can't make

2241
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,719
a penetrating because you've

2242
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,460
done that

2243
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:03,239
this game is 90 psychological

2244
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,760
it's easy to talk yourself out of it

2245
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,460
and it's easy program your mind to keep

2246
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,199
you in the game before you really know

2247
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:12,360
the skill set you have to cheerlead

2248
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,139
yourself

2249
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:14,699
nobody's gonna be able to do it for you

2250
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:16,620
just watching my videos is not enough

2251
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,020
I promise you I have paid members that

2252
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,699
have paid me

2253
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:23,400
and they still can't do it because they

2254
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,080
have not done what I've told them to do

2255
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,820
or they think they've done enough but

2256
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,159
they haven't

2257
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:30,900
the fruits and the results will come

2258
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,580
because of what they've done and they

2259
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,500
gotta lead the at the door when

2260
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,659
they come in they can't bring in Wyckoff

2261
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:38,820
Theory and harmonics and other stuff and

2262
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,860
try to blend it together you have to

2263
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,960
learn this first forget all that stuff

2264
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,840
learn this and then once you understand

2265
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,659
this it's easy to go into a John Murphy

2266
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:50,820
Financial uh what's it technical

2267
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,900
analysis of the financial markets that's

2268
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,540
the retail Trader's Bible everything in

2269
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,380
that book

2270
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,520
everything in that book can be contrary

2271
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,400
if you understand this but

2272
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,440
same side of the coin

2273
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,840
if you flip it over you can make those

2274
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,520
retail Concepts work if you understand

2275
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,159
this premise tonight

2276
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,900
see the problem with retail Traders is

2277
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,340
they don't look at the market like this

2278
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,679
they're looking for patterns for

2279
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:18,300
pattern's sake they're looking for

2280
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,040
indicator confirmation they're looking

2281
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,580
for things that cuts through all the

2282
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,860
they think noise or uncertainty or

2283
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,380
randomness of price action if you're

2284
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,659
believing that price is random what the

2285
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:31,860
 are you thinking the indicator is

2286
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,120
going to do it's not changing the

2287
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,280
randomness it's just adding something

2288
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,920
else to believe in

2289
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,659
so that's not the right way the right

2290
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:41,460
way is understanding why price delivers

2291
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,260
the way it does and it does

2292
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,060
own a basis of time

2293
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,120
and price there's a time that it

2294
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,219
operates and it's reaching for us very

2295
01:27:50,219 --> 01:27:51,540
specific price

2296
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,800
I've already taught you the time

2297
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,719
elements and today I've already taught

2298
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,139
you the price elements time and price

2299
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:01,500
between those two you will always have a

2300
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,880
setup for life

2301
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,760
you can have a breaker you can have a

2302
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,800
institutional order flow entry drill you

2303
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,719
can have a fair value gap an inversion

2304
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:12,060
fair value cap I did this trade today

2305
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,580
the rub the nose of the guy that was in

2306
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,080
my comment section and you know you

2307
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,239
don't see him but he's in

2308
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,120
the videos where I uh it looks like my

2309
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,719
comment section open is open rather like

2310
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,400
It's usually the pre-recorded videos I

2311
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,600
think it's what it does I think I don't

2312
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,520
think it lets you do a comment or it

2313
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,239
doesn't look like there's going to be

2314
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,340
comments open for a live stream

2315
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,739
but whenever I do a pre-recorded video

2316
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:36,480
this section underneath the video it

2317
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,860
looks like you can leave a comment and I

2318
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,179
have so many people saying first first

2319
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:42,780
first comment whatever that's silly but

2320
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,000
invariably I get some goober that comes

2321
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,219
in there and will say like you know this

2322
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:50,040
is never done in advance and you you're

2323
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,600
making this stuff up it doesn't work it

2324
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,060
only works sometimes well that's true

2325
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:55,800
for you because you don't know what the

2326
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,360
 you're doing but I know what I'm

2327
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,780
doing and in inversion fear value gaps I

2328
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,340
know which fair value Gap is going to be

2329
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,620
inverted here it is folks and I've shown

2330
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,960
it to you on a 15 second chart

2331
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,520
like you can't get any planer than that

2332
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,080
it's real

2333
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,780
it's absolutely a real phenomenon it's

2334
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,100
really there

2335
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,739
but you know what makes it valid and how

2336
01:29:19,739 --> 01:29:21,360
to predict it

2337
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,460
understanding liquidity

2338
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,199
understanding time and price

2339
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:29,880
that lunch hour

2340
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,260
that nobody goes to lunch

2341
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,139
the algorithm runs on that liquidity

2342
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,179
and then it starts repricing and

2343
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,340
spooling to the next pool liquidity so

2344
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,739
since it took sell side okay what did I

2345
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:44,639
teach you

2346
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,520
price only goes up to take buy side or

2347
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,980
buy stops or it goes up to an

2348
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,139
inefficiency above market price that's

2349
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:54,000
the only two reasons that price

2350
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,860
goes up period and the story I don't

2351
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,239
care how many years you've been trading

2352
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,739
you can call yourself a market maker I

2353
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:00,000
don't care what institution you work for

2354
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,040
you banked that this one you did this

2355
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,360
trading for that when you managed funds

2356
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,639
and I don't give a

2357
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:06,960
price only goes up for one of two

2358
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,179
reasons to go up to inefficiency above

2359
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:10,800
market price where it runs up for buy

2360
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,900
side liquidity buy stops that's it folks

2361
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,159
that is it it's not going up against

2362
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,659
buying pressure and it's not going down

2363
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:17,100
because of selling pressure

2364
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,159
it's going down for inefficiency

2365
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,320
below market price or it's going down

2366
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,120
for South Side liquidity period and the

2367
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,940
story that is it if it's not doing one

2368
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,340
of those two things

2369
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,260
it's going sideways

2370
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,300
I already teach you and taught you the

2371
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,560
economic calendar tells you when it's

2372
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,659
going to consolidate

2373
01:30:36,659 --> 01:30:39,300
so what does that leave up or down okay

2374
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,920
how do you know if it's going to go up

2375
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,199
or down look at the weekly chart

2376
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,340
what is it going to reach for on that

2377
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,900
Weekly candlestick

2378
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,120
something above the price or below the

2379
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:48,840
price

2380
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,020
which is the most obvious

2381
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,639
there's going to be a fair bag Gap or

2382
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:54,840
liquidity

2383
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,360
which is the most easiest closest

2384
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,120
proximity PD array

2385
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,239
it's probably going to go to that one

2386
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:04,620
but what if you're wrong then you

2387
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,900
 lose

2388
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,159
You're Gonna Lose sometimes you're gonna

2389
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,199
lose folks you're gonna get it wrong

2390
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:12,360
sometimes why are you afraid

2391
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,280
look at how many new opportunities are

2392
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,139
made available to you now you have

2393
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:18,120
information that is not found anywhere

2394
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,080
else

2395
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,060
I have laughed at all these

2396
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,080
clowns

2397
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,139
for 30 years on an internet pretending

2398
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:28,199
they had some kind of Holy Grail

2399
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,540
and they're Clueless

2400
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,540
absolutely Clueless

2401
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,639
and they perpetuate and regurgitate all

2402
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:38,280
the stuff that I've bought in books

2403
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,219
over 2 000 books and it's all horseshit

2404
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:42,840
and I just can't bring it

2405
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,520
throw I can't bring myself to the point

2406
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,840
of throwing them away because number one

2407
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,340
I spend a lot of good money on it I

2408
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,440
worked hard for that money

2409
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,179
and it just reminds me

2410
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:55,020
of what I had to Wade through

2411
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,900
and all the horseshit and lies and

2412
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,639
garbage that people believe that makes

2413
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,500
these markets move up and down

2414
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,219
and it's all horseshit it's a waste of

2415
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,800
time all the things that you think is

2416
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,600
going to make the price go up and down

2417
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,940
if it's in a book unless I wrote it it's

2418
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:14,460
all horseshit and yes I just let pride

2419
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,780
and ego speak right there because I can

2420
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,159
do it I have the authority I have the

2421
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:19,820
authority to do so

2422
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,560
you have a setup for life if you use

2423
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,760
this information

2424
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,820
I have given you the freedom

2425
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:30,179
to be able to pick what your entry model

2426
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:32,639
is going to be

2427
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,920
which one are you going to use

2428
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,540
is it going to be an overblock a fair

2429
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,179
value Gap optimal trade entry inversion

2430
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,400
fair value Gap

2431
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,679
turtle soup

2432
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,480
uh consequent encroachment of a wick

2433
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,040
hmm

2434
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,900
all these things

2435
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,300
are left into your hands and I'm making

2436
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,920
allowance for that because I don't know

2437
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,100
where you started in my videos

2438
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,860
and if you're wondering where to start

2439
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:05,760
the 2022 model or 2022 mentorship it's

2440
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,620
41 videos I promise you if you start

2441
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:10,380
there you will get the shortest route to

2442
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,699
going into the charts and finding

2443
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:14,699
something that works every day

2444
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:17,460
every day works every day now here's

2445
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:20,880
here's the caveat it may not work in the

2446
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,040
market that you're looking at right now

2447
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,500
but it's in every single one of these

2448
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,840
markets it's in there

2449
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,340
so what does that mean if you're an

2450
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,659
index Trader

2451
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:33,000
it will be in one index

2452
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,400
it may be in multiple index

2453
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,699
but it might only be M1 and that's why I

2454
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:39,960
teach you to look at all three of the

2455
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,560
averages the Dow the NASDAQ and the s p

2456
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,260
it may not be in the pound but it is in

2457
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,239
the euro

2458
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,679
you see the difference that's why I

2459
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,120
teach at least

2460
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,179
a Triad when I talk predominantly only

2461
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:57,000
Forex I was teaching dollar euro dollar

2462
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,800
and pound dollar

2463
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,699
you can't miss it then it's there

2464
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:04,920
you have to have intermarket

2465
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,199
relationships and study like that with a

2466
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,560
closely correlated Market Euro and cable

2467
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,960
or euro dollar and pound dollar are

2468
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,760
closely correlated

2469
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,980
they're inversely correlated

2470
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,420
with the dollar

2471
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,000
so when the dog goes up they go down

2472
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,920
but just because the dollar is going

2473
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,440
down doesn't mean it's a good buy to be

2474
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,120
in Euro sometimes it's a better buy-in

2475
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,639
cable most times it's better than cable

2476
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:31,679
better in cable rather but there's going

2477
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:32,760
to be times when the dollar is going

2478
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,540
sideways in the Euro or cable May

2479
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,820
outperform one or the other

2480
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:40,320
what does that mean

2481
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,239
it just means that the real trade is not

2482
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,300
in that one it's in the Exotic meaning

2483
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,219
that you can use the pound dollar if

2484
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:50,159
it's really running or it's predisposed

2485
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:51,480
to go up more if the dollar is

2486
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,560
consolidating

2487
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,480
that means you probably have a really

2488
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,520
good trade short I'm sorry long and

2489
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,179
pound yen

2490
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,440
don't take my word for it just consider

2491
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,940
it I've done lessons and core content

2492
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:05,520
about that stuff too

2493
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,199
those videos are not coming down in

2494
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,239
November everything on this YouTube

2495
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,219
channel will stay

2496
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,620
I won't be here updating it after

2497
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:14,760
November

2498
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,040
but I promise I will leave you with more

2499
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,840
than you will ever need

2500
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,300
and you study at your own pace don't

2501
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,460
rush

2502
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,440
if you rush you just make it just makes

2503
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,239
your learning curve longer

2504
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:30,480
you can't you can't speed learn this

2505
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,420
you can't learn I I saw a guy

2506
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,000
I watched all of ICT videos and I've

2507
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,320
condensed it

2508
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,120
into 15 videos

2509
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,920
and now you can do it quicker and sooner

2510
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,600
and faster more efficiently Porsche

2511
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,480
that's you hear that that's me

2512
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,860
laughing at your ass you are

2513
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,060
clown if you think you can take

2514
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:49,500
everything I've done and condense it

2515
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,060
into the smallest little time frame of

2516
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,040
presentation you're going to miss so

2517
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,600
much information

2518
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,940
there's so much information in the stuff

2519
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,620
I've given

2520
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,780
and you don't even appreciate what it is

2521
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,340
because you just went through it one

2522
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,239
time and you haven't even started

2523
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:04,800
trading with real money

2524
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,000
and when you start trading real money

2525
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,260
you come back and you watch those same

2526
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,780
videos again you're like oh he said

2527
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:11,159
that I didn't hear that the first time

2528
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:12,960
you're gonna swear up and down and I

2529
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,420
made an edit to the video and I haven't

2530
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,739
it just doesn't mean anything to you

2531
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:18,179
right now because you're not even a demo

2532
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:19,860
Trader yet with consistency

2533
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,300
when you start trading with real money

2534
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,520
the lessons and all those droning

2535
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,139
discussions

2536
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:28,020
jaw burning by ICT all that's that's

2537
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,120
going to be much more meaningful to you

2538
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,900
it's going to be rich understanding

2539
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,699
because it'll be

2540
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:37,739
you that's prepared to hear it you're

2541
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:39,480
not prepared to hear it most times

2542
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:40,800
you're not

2543
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,840
and to be honest with you I'm not

2544
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,580
talking to you

2545
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:46,620
I'm talking to my children

2546
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:50,100
that's what all this is for

2547
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,780
that movie with Michael Keaton my life

2548
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,600
that's what I'm doing right here

2549
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,280
When I'm Gone

2550
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,920
they'll have all this they'll have all

2551
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,020
this to listen to and compare and

2552
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,580
contrast with notes that I have for

2553
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,219
enigma which I am not teaching and none

2554
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,900
of these presentations ever had Enigma

2555
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,420
in them and no joker has cracked it and

2556
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,100
figured it out either

2557
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,840
