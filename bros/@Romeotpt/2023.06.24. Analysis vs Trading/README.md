You should always look to learn and read price in a way you can trade it.  
there is a huge difference between a Trader and a Chart artist (Twitter Analyst).  

Suppose price leave your POI (liquidity pool) without you.  
Whenever you miss a price move, you must analyze 3 main things:  
  1. How could I have participated? What mistakes made me it is going to a low but it didn't go the low?
  2. Where my Stop Loss have been if I was correct?
  3. How could I have got in the move as a continuation trader?

• SMT •   

A little bit of history…  
The idea of divergence between assets was first introduced by Charles Dow (1800s).   

• We can use SMT for three main reasons:  
1- Turtle soup.   
2- Validating market structure shifts.    
3- SMT fvg fills.   
4- (bonus) Leaving “equal lows”.
