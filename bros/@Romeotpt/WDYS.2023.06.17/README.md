So…  
Does this mean that the market structure shift is a lie?  
And ICT is scamming all of us?  

Nope.    
It means that as I’ve mentioned before many times;   
a lower timeframe market structure shift… is less relevant than a higher timeframe pd array*.

I got this 1 wrong but,after you posted the result this is my key take away: 
1. Orderflow is bearish.
2. the area I marked as HTF FVG essentially looks like institutional footprint which indicates that price is to push lower.  
3. but in order to do that it has to come back to premium range.



1. Orderflow is bullish.
2. The SSL [5m] essentially looks like institutional footprint which indicates that price is to push higher.  
3. The +BB [15m] act az a multiplier
4. But in order to do that it has to come back to discount range.
