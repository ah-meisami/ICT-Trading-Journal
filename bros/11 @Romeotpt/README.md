Don’t bet too large on low quality setups,  
And don’t bet too small on high quality setups.

- You.  
- Your charts.   
  
Everything else (including me), is background noise.

1. Foundation
2. Market Efficiency Paradigm (MEP) - Smart Money vs Dump Money (from the lens of Highs and Lows)
3. Market Profiles  (Trend, Range, Chop)
4. Entry Techniques
=========================================================================== 1.Foundation
1. What are the markets? Money Loosing Machine (95% - 9/10)
2. Why you stay in the market despite loosing again and again!?
  - Because no one loose every single day. They have some wins (when wins feel happy, when lose feel sadness). entice by the wins they have
  - Because you are the gambler. addicted to gambling. no life outside of the market.

  comments:
   - you are greedy when you win
   - Hope of winning
3.Technical Edge (TE) vs. Percentage of Risk to Reward (RR%)
  - Technical Edge is irrelevant 
  - You can't control the price but you can control the risk with %RR
4.Journal
  - Every single job in the world has register
  - The Purpose of journalling every single trade: 
    1. correcting mistakes
    2. eliminating bad trades
  - Back testing is cool but Tape reading is the skill you want to master
===========================================================================
[01:30:00]  If HTF PDAs failed got to LTF PDAs.
    for example:
    - After #CPIreport [2023.07.12], ES and NQ making Higher High but YM making Lower Low.
    - so expecting +OB[h4] support the price but failed.
    - so expecting +[h1] support the price and it happened.
===========================================================================
[01:43:00] I don't look at the news to predict the charts. I look at the charts to predict the news.
My A+ setup never failed but if it failed then I am wrong and I will never blame the price:
  - I miss read the Order Flow.
  - I miss read Reversal Time
  - I miss read Reversal Point
  - I miss read Liquidity Pool
=========================================================================== 2. Market Efficiency Paradigm (MEP) - Smart Money vs Dump Money (from the lens of Highs and Lows)  
Dumb money even hedge funds like FTX: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-went-wrong-with-ftx-6828447]  
How do you measure High and Low?
1. IPDA data ranges
2. Dealing Ranges
3. The Current Expansion Leg
===========================================================================
[02:28:00] 
- If You are bullish on HTF WHY you are bearish on LTF? Because you focus only on one time frame.
- A MSS in LTF is less relevant than HTF PDAs.
===========================================================================

What would you expect when going deeper into FVG[weekly][2023.04.24][ES] like the 2nd time we saw?
There is 3 type of reaction to a key level: 
1. Instant-Reaction [V-Shaped reaction]
2. Two-Touch-Reaction [W-Shaped reaction] (Turtle Soup) (More Favorable)
3. Multiple-Touch-Reaction (least Favorable)
