[Music]

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,280
so the idea was that NASDAQ was going to

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,420
attack this Range High

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,020
after

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,939
Turtles souping the range low right

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,740
so as we know we have a ranging Market

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,460
then a purge of either side is gonna

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,640
take us to the other side right

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,260
so

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,180
the monthly

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,579
and of course if you probe the order

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,540
flow then we are disrespecting

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,180
this bullish order block right we close

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,440
below it

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,780
we're supposed to accelerate downwards

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,840
if it was a valid bearish order block

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,980
but

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,280
it was invalidated

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,039
we did not respect the bearish Peter

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,500
right and

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,640
we created a bullish PD array which is

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
this uh

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,060
breaker right here right

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,560
and we have this bullish

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,659
order block right here

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,540
so we uh we trade above it we come back

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,420
into it and we rally so the monthly is

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,159
bullish the monthly is screaming bullish

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,020
and I've been saying it

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
in the replies on Twitter and I even

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,460
gave out a trade idea a couple of weeks

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,420
ago

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,040
a couple of weeks there was one two I

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,259
think it was two weeks ago

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,259
so

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,140
we're expecting the month of uh now I

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,420
was expecting it to happen in April but

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,360
they did not give me that

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,020
so we're expecting a bullish expansion

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,360
to the upside during the month of March

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,520
When You're Expecting a bullish

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,040
candle to print then you look to buy

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,140
below the open price

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,500
right so bullish candle

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,538
you'll see right now

46
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,180
you wait for the open if you're bullish

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,520
you wait for accumulation manipulation

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,540
into a discount PD array and a rally

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,599
right

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,420
which we'll see right now

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,560
so now down to the weekly

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,379
of course this is the the infamous bar

53
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,800
replay however this was called live on

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,819
Twitter

55
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,400
right I literally spoon fed you all a

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,860
trade idea

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,800
so you can't complain

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,300
and if you do then uh

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,060
I can't help you

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,620
so

61
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,599
let's probe first of all we have a range

62
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,440
right range range Low Range High we

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
purge the range low

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,000
so we have two Targets the 50 and the

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,180
Range High so

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,300
so the eyes are up here so the drawn

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,360
liquidity prices is is gravitating

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,200
towards the Range High

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,860
right

70
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,840
plus it's disrespecting bullish PD

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,940
arrays uh bearish PD Rays excuse me on

72
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,220
the monthly it's disrespecting bearish

73
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,959
speed areas on the monthly and

74
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,760
respecting bullish pteries on the

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,860
monthly now let's look at the weekly the

76
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,120
weekly is saying that

77
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,959
well it's not talking but the weekly

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,280
chart is telling you

79
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,040
the price is also again it's breaking

80
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,540
highs

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,000
it's rejecting lows

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,019
right it's breaking through bullish PD

83
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,040
rays

84
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,319
bearish not bullish it's breaking

85
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,440
through this this this uh bearish order

86
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
block

87
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,220
and it's respecting

88
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,379
this bullish weekly fvg

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,099
all right

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,180
so you got a turtle soup

91
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,799
and you go to Rally

92
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,040
so monthly is bullish

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,100
obviously is bullish

94
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,680
weekly is bullish so

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
price is

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,900
is uh is more likely to go upwards and

97
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
we have the range of course the range is

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
saying

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,300
the range is it's a cheat code

100
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,000
if you know what to look for it can tell

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
you a lot of stuff

102
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,240
um

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,460
so anyway

104
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,580
by all means we are we are bullish

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,199
as as we've said before as I've said

106
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,380
before because there's no we here

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,900
uh

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm not your your typical Twitter ICT

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,340
influencer quote unquote

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,860
this is a one-man show

111
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,720
so

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,540
uh how do you probe border flow highs

113
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,960
and lows

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,000
Order Box

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,220
which is down close and up close candles

116
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,620
are up close candles providing

117
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,800
resistance or being broken through and

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,100
down close candles providing support

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,120
or vice versa and fvgs

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,340
these are the three ways to measure and

121
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,039
probe order flow as you can see right

122
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,820
now

123
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,419
so

124
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,380
lows and highs we are rejecting the low

125
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,020
and we're breaking the height that's one

126
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,479
thing another thing is we are breaking

127
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,960
through

128
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,220
we are breaking through

129
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,000
bearish PD arrays

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,500
on the weekly

131
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,400
this one as well

132
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,000
and we're respecting bullish PD arrays

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,139
right

134
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,539
uh which is the candles so the up close

135
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,820
candles are being broken through

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,320
and the down closed candles are

137
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,860
providing support

138
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,880
gaps same thing so order flow is bullish

139
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
on the weekly and when you have weekly

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
bullish order flow then you can't expect

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,600
resistance from a daily PD array right

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
until the weekly objective is met

143
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,080
and so on you can apply that to all time

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
frames

145
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,220
as time and price are both fractal

146
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,919
what's going on over here drawing small

147
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,180
dots so

148
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,840
monthly order flow is bullish

149
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,699
weekly bullish

150
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,020
now let's look at the daily

151
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,419
here

152
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,500
and it was precisely over here

153
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,520
that I called for the rally to the Range

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,759
High

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,419
another key level

156
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,240
is the monthly order block

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
all right

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,340
let's draw a line

159
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,500
order luck monthly

160
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,099
over here

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,580
I'd like to keep keep the charts clean

162
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,440
so let's just keep it

163
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,340
a bit

164
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
less

165
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,599
dense is that the word

166
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,220
I don't think so

167
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,259
but anyway

168
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,220
we're not here to learn about

169
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,099
photography or editing or whatever

170
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,220
design image imagery

171
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,620
we are here to learn about price

172
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,500
so we're breaking highs and we're

173
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,000
rejecting the lows right

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,220
eyes

175
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,759
broken

176
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,620
lows

177
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,300
rejected

178
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,500
bullish candles providing

179
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,339
bullish up close candles are being

180
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,559
broken through and down close candles

181
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,539
are providing support

182
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,479
so order flow is bullish right

183
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,500
order flow is bullish

184
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,899
highs lows

185
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,360
bearish candles and gaps

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,700
by all means

187
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,940
order flow is uh bullish so there is no

188
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,339
reason to expect any downside there is

189
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,320
no reason to expect a turtle soup over

190
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,180
here which takes us down here to the

191
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,820
range low right why because we're we're

192
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,580
respecting bullish PD arrays on the

193
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,760
monthly and weekly and daily

194
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,860
so as long as the order flow is being

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,019
respected turtle soup follows order flow

196
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,260
right you can't they go hand in hand if

197
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,920
you try and if you try and

198
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,140
trade turtle soup as a pattern you'll

199
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,339
get wrecked

200
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,519
you must understand order flow

201
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,660
so anyway

202
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,000
we were right here

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
right over here so we broke through the

204
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,680
high and I mentioned this a lot of times

205
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,440
we broke through the high so we're

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
breaking highs

207
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
how do you know broke through because

208
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,980
you closed above the high

209
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,920
when we close above a high

210
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,040
and multiple times right

211
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,019
look at the difference between this

212
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,480
close and this close

213
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,820
not even a wick right so this is a

214
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,959
rejection

215
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,040
and this is a break

216
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,200
and this is a rejection before a break

217
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,120
this is a common pattern which you'll

218
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,120
recognize uh before a rail breakout

219
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,600
right there is a

220
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,680
a quick sharp decline before a violent

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,839
move upwards

222
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,600
right that's a little bit more advanced

223
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
a more more intricate

224
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,040
uh but for those who are interested in

225
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,920
studying that you can you can enjoy

226
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,279
that little piece of

227
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,540
that little nugget of information which

228
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,320
I gave away

229
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
and yes it is a nugget which you can use

230
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,860
uh how to use that let's talk about that

231
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,560
how do you use that pattern or that

232
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
little price

233
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
uh fractal which repeats again and again

234
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,000
and again before a real Breakout

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,060
right of any uh range

236
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,160
there is a

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
a sharp

238
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
false breakout first and then a violent

239
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,540
uh break out right

240
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,200
same with the bearish there is a

241
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,940
before you before you break through the

242
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,100
range there is a violent for Trace

243
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,440
and then it breaks out

244
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,540
all right the purpose of this is

245
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,399
to

246
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,540
sucker in

247
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,540
more sellers at this previous resistance

248
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,220
level

249
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,019
right

250
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,200
and convince them of their positions

251
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,260
they add more and they get erect

252
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,180
plus that's one group of people getting

253
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,200
 up

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,720
uh uh it also induces or entices unlike

255
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
the inducement to uh it's to uh cliche

256
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,100
everyone's using it

257
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,920
so it entices buyers above this high

258
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,720
they also get suckered in before being

259
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,760
right

260
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,860
but the movement is so violent that they

261
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,980
suck that they cower out again right

262
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,839
that's good number two being being

263
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,279
screwed over

264
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,100
group number three being screwed over is

265
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,440
the guy who was short down over here at

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
this turtle soup

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,640
when it breaks above the high

268
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,899
then he gives away his position

269
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,459
in fear of it going and rallying higher

270
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,500
and it comes back down he regrets he

271
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,899
sells again and he gets wrecked right so

272
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,680
uh

273
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,519
there's always these three groups of

274
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,940
people always in any price movement

275
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,680
there is uh these three groups of people

276
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,180
and usually they're the same person

277
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,519
who's just trying to catch every single

278
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,800
price swing and they're getting wrecked

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
up and down

280
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,300
uh and this is something you will not

281
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,120
understand unless you go and get wrecked

282
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,980
yourself again and again and again and

283
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,160
again

284
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
and uh you'll really understand each and

285
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
every single price movement why this

286
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
happens why that happens why this

287
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,120
happens

288
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
uh

289
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,320
that's on a personal loan but on a smart

290
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,480
money versus dumb money level that's the

291
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,420
explanation of of what's the what's the

292
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,740
purpose of this move because every

293
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,260
single price move as I say every single

294
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,500
price move has an explanation right

295
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,120
so

296
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,680
well it's nonsense

297
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,200
of course you use it how because over

298
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
here

299
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,660
before we remove it

300
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,940
how do you use this

301
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,740
well you can use it by being long from

302
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,360
the range low anyway

303
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,700
right that's the that's the cleanest

304
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,279
those are my moves I enter at the at the

305
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,320
extremities of the range

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,220
or the 50 or a higher time frame PD

307
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,519
array

308
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,480
however a model that has been uh showed

309
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,839
is

310
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,760
show it to you is uh the turtle soup at

311
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,920
the 50 of the range

312
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,720
and that is where this comes in play

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,060
before the breakout there's a turtle

314
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,660
soup that happens at or near the 50 of

315
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,120
the range

316
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,800
if that resonates with you you can use

317
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,339
it as a model

318
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,420
because as we as I mentioned before many

319
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,139
times you want to find one

320
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,060
model which you perfect

321
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,480
not try everything out right

322
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,639
you want to go and marry one one one

323
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,760
girl one woman

324
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,519
and create a nice long

325
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,579
long lasting

326
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,980
sustainable relationship

327
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,440
which means something right you got a

328
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
house together you got you got kids you

329
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,060
got you got a whole life together yeah

330
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,560
you got memories

331
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,160
you got

332
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,440
you have

333
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
going through adversity together right

334
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,060
you have all of this

335
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,399
with one person

336
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,860
as opposed to

337
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,779
one night stand here when I stand here

338
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,880
one here one here one here meaningless

339
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,980
meaningless meaningless this is a good

340
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,860
comparison an analogy of having a model

341
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,399
versus having no model

342
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,519
right

343
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,199
I'm not sure I went over there but uh

344
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,899
that is an analogy

345
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,420
so we remove all of this nonsense and we

346
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,440
focus on the trade idea

347
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,800
we broke through the high

348
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,680
and we created a PD array at the High

349
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,920
which is this fvg right

350
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,399
over here and that is when I said folks

351
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,260
my friends

352
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,360
ladies and gentlemen

353
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,220
we're gonna attack this

354
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,560
August High

355
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,220
from here

356
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,420
the trade idea I gave up was this

357
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,959
so

358
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,699
we trade back

359
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,660
into the high and this is where the SR

360
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,639
Philips work but they don't work because

361
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,380
they're Sr Phillips they work because of

362
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,380
the PD array created at the high which

363
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,600
is this order block fvg right

364
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,040
order block

365
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,540
fvg

366
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,180
combination

367
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,839
so

368
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,940
the idea I gave out was this was we

369
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,179
trade back into the fvg

370
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,579
into the broken High

371
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,780
and we rally

372
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,599
Off to the Races

373
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,299
to August High

374
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,579
obviously potentially a bit higher

375
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,079
because uh

376
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,819
uh

377
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,079
a liquidity Purge is going to be

378
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,299
is going to be a

379
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,000
it's not going to be add to the tick and

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
then it's going to decline no it's going

381
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
to be a bit higher it varies according

382
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,280
to the time frame

383
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,200
but that's the point

384
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,299
and you don't know if it's going to be a

385
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,100
break or Purge

386
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,080
you have to watch you have some

387
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,539
indications which I'm not going to speak

388
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,620
about over here

389
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,820
because there's not much time

390
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,260
but

391
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,720
um generally speaking you want to

392
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,500
anticipate a run slightly above the high

393
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,000
or below the low right

394
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,260
so

395
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,600
the anticipation was in summary

396
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,820
because I know some people like to hear

397
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,740
the Rants and others just want to get to

398
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,820
the point

399
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,179
so in summary we break the high we

400
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,179
create the PD array at the High

401
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,100
as soon as this happens we have

402
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,539
displacement

403
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,160
we have a break of the high we have

404
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,260
bullish order flow on the monthly weekly

405
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,840
and daily so we expect to retrace into

406
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,460
the fvg and a rally

407
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,799
and what happened that is precisely what

408
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,740
happened now right over here when you

409
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,539
see this dump

410
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,280
which happened right over here

411
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,679
right here now

412
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,020
how many of you would get suckered into

413
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,720
uh selling that

414
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,200
probably more than I would like to say

415
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,460
so

416
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,880
however the rule says if we're breaking

417
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
highs

418
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,480
then the dump below the low

419
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,179
is a fake turtle soup

420
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,059
plus it's into a pedia array

421
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,679
right also on the weekly time frame

422
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,780
which is I'm going to leave to you

423
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,440
so when we're bullish then then bearish

424
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,120
dumps

425
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,340
are to be bought right that is when you

426
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,840
buy the dip you don't buy the dip in a

427
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,940
down trending Market you buy the dip in

428
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,320
an uptrending Market

429
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,440
right on the right side of the curve so

430
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,620
oh

431
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
we uh

432
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,940
decline into the fvg

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,160
we give it a second touch and this is

434
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,860
where I call for ES to Rally that's also

435
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,000
another review which is going to come

436
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,559
out soon this uh this week

437
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,360
hopefully

438
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,900
inshallah

439
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,140
uh so

440
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,640
the dump below the low is expected to be

441
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,520
a fake false phony turtle soup and we

442
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,700
rally and that is precisely what

443
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,660
happened

444
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,860
right

445
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,120
just blast it off

446
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,740
now the stop loss was also given so this

447
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,280
is this was pretty much a spoon fed idea

448
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,400
which I used to do a lot back in the day

449
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,840
I do less of it now but I still do it

450
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,820
it's not as much

451
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,799
here is one the stop loss could have

452
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,539
been this

453
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,980
all right

454
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,419
but I'm a so I give

455
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,980
conservative stop losses on Twitter

456
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,520
which is this intermediate term low

457
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,000
right

458
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,539
and that was the trade idea which you

459
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,880
see I will either have posted the

460
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,700
picture before this video or after this

461
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,940
video

462
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,220
and um

463
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,039
that is it my friends

464
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,919
a short quick and much I'm not exactly

465
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,200
sure how long this video was

466
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,580
but that is a short quick

467
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,780
analysis of

468
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,780
the NASDAQ trade price wise

469
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:50,700
time wise
if you look at the open high low and close of the monthly chart
why is this not giving me the
uh
all right well if you look at the open high low and close of the monthly chart 
exit yes

477
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,860
let's go to the monthly candle

478
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,960
and yes it's delayed data for the

479
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,020
 because I don't trade NASDAQ I

480
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,360
trade Nas 100.

481
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,419
if I do trade NASDAQ or or yes I don't

482
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,900
trade Es at least now actually SPX 500

483
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,700
if I do right

484
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,000
so I don't need to buy this

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
uh you can buy it you can go and

486
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
do what you want

487
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
there was some some goofballs commenting

488
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
on the delayed data right it's always

489
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
funny because people always find

490
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,460
something to about

491
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,240
uh generally speaking I don't mind

492
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
I like to uh

493
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
uh

494
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,840
I like to uh you know just have a back

495
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,880
and forth a playful back and forth as

496
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,679
long as it's respectful

497
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,380
if you're disrespectful then I probably

498
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,020
won't engage with you right if you're

499
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,960
having a playful fun back and forth and

500
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,340
sure I'm game

501
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,860
so

502
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,380
the monthly candles

503
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,780
power of three so we're bullish what did

504
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,460
I say we expect to buy below the open

505
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,600
price right

506
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,400
there's so much more

507
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,799
but let's stay on topic

508
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,720
let us stay on topic

509
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,299
so let's go back

510
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,000
to the beginning of the month

511
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,260
right

512
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,760
let's go to daily

513
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,799
run or right now

514
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,200
why is this time messed up what is this

515
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,039
let's open a NASDAQ for this one let's

516
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,500
open a Nas 100.

517
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,039
Naz 100

518
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,640
cleaner

519
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,990
[Music]

520
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,400
let's go to the monthly

521
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,120
remove this

522
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,159
so

523
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,700
my expectation was a classic buy candle

524
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,820
literally an expansion to the upside why

525
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,960
I will leave that for you to figure out

526
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,780
good luck with it

527
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,820
I've mentioned it on my Twitter a couple

528
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,919
times

529
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,320
so if you haven't had the focus to go

530
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,220
and

531
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,500
dig deep then you don't deserve to know

532
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
oh but I don't have time I'm busy with

533
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
life you don't deserve to know

534
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,419
because if you really wanted to know you

535
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,740
would dig deep and you would know

536
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,940
oh but I got kids I got a fan you don't

537
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,140
deserve to know

538
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,159
so

539
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,940
monthly let's go to the

540
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,960
remove this

541
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,679
so

542
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,360
too many shows

543
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,960
but I just woke up so who cares

544
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,360
so the monthly candle opens as we said

545
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,039
when we're bullish

546
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,419
right

547
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,799
I'd like to see the multi of the poor

548
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,580
hour

549
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,539
gives me a nice view

550
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,740
when we are bullish

551
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,600
and we're expecting higher prices

552
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,240
then what do we do

553
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,299
then we simply

554
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,820
buy below the opening price

555
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,919
we wait for a manipulation below the

556
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,080
open price and we buy right

557
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,779
before the month opens we have the two

558
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,840
key levels which we expect to cap the

559
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,960
monthly candle right or the expansion

560
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,659
whatever candle it is before the candle

561
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,640
opens and you're expecting an expansion

562
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,220
candle then you

563
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,919
draw the two key levels which you expect

564
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,340
to provide the expansion

565
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,679
from the low to the high

566
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,000
so we have here a four hour

567
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,960
all right let's pretend this never

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,200
happened

569
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,520
all right here none of this happened

570
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,140
we have these two key levels

571
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,900
right over here we have this one

572
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,880
the August High and the monthly order

573
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,919
block up here

574
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,020
but as always when you have a Target

575
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,179
when you're in a trade then it's always

576
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,419
good to exit at 75 percent of the target

577
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,179
that's what I do

578
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,440
so

579
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,659
the month another so the month of the

580
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,320
monthly candle opens we decline below

581
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
the opening price

582
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,480
right so manipulation as soon as you see

583
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,860
a decline

584
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,500
obviously not blindly within context but

585
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,919
when you see a decline or a rally

586
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
below or above the opening price

587
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,500
then you should be on alert

588
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,940
you got this

589
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,299
you had a beautiful beautiful

590
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,120
open when we're bullish we buy below the

591
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,779
opening price

592
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,460
right so you buy here

593
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,380
your stop loss is going to be either

594
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,960
down here or you choose an intermediate

595
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,120
term low nearby

596
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,640
and then you

597
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,520
ride until

598
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,840
price reaches the opposite end of the

599
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,900
range you're expecting it to go

600
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,380
right

601
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,299
it's open you buy below the opening

602
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,320
price

603
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,640
and you wait for your trade to play out

604
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,919
now I was going to use the RR tool

605
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,400
that's too tacky you get the idea

606
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,000
right so entry would be this

607
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,380
so again open decline key level

608
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,900
higher time frame daily order block is

609
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,120
giving you a four hour expansion

610
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,179
right

611
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:31,440
while we're bullish on the monthly and

612
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
we're expecting a monthly bullish candle

613
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,559
so

614
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,240
that was Eddie as soon as as soon as it

615
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,860
hits to this top or even before you're

616
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,320
out of the trade idea

617
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,120
as a tape reading practice you can wait

618
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,860
you can you can watch it you can always

619
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,080
watch it

620
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,520
that's another thing is when you when

621
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,740
you miss a move don't be pissed when you

622
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,020
miss your entry you don't get a fill for

623
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,059
example that's an that's an opportunity

624
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,299
for you to learn

625
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,559
all right

626
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,080
so you should be happy when you lose you

627
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,779
should be happy when you miss

628
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,880
opportunities because that is a

629
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,820
that is a way for you to learn about

630
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,179
price

631
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,600
open

632
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
decline

633
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,840
expansion

634
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,080
right

635
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,419
and again before the break

636
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,580
a fake

637
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,620
decline

638
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,840
and then true break

639
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,380
right

640
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,480
anyway

641
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,419
that is the

642
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,700
NASDAQ described

643
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,940
from both lenses of time and price

644
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,059
and that is pretty much it my friends

645
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,399
and a quick bonus for those viewers who

646
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,580
who stuck it out till here there was a

647
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,559
trade over here

648
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,179
a trade idea which had formed

649
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,940
potentially but failed

650
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,299
let's look at Whitefield

651
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:24,500
right over here

652
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,020
the idea was breaker into these equal

653
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,080
lows right looks reasonable

654
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,460
breaker

655
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,860
into the equal loss

656
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,899
right

657
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,679
however

658
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,039
You could argue that it's a valid idea

659
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,039
it's not completely invalid because

660
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,159
it was a low that that did not Purge it

661
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,039
was a mere stop hunt of the high

662
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,059
breaker and two equal lows that's a

663
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,100
valid setup

664
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
however

665
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,760
which I had to give out by the way

666
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,039
now when you see

667
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,340
price approaching a breaker

668
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,779
then what do you want to see you want to

669
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,080
see the wicking through the body and

670
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,580
never closing above the

671
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,919
uh the closing price at the breaker

672
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,000
right

673
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,620
so what you don't want to see is this

674
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,480
this close inside that is a horrible

675
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,059
sign and that is usually a sign that is

676
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,220
going to Target the breaker's high

677
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,919
right so when you see when you have when

678
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,260
you're when you have a bearish bias and

679
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,179
you see a breaker

680
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,720
being

681
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,100
disrespected then you can reasonably

682
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,679
anticipate that the breaker is high is

683
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,840
going to be purged

684
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,539
right or attacked or targeted

685
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,520
so that in itself is a trade idea

686
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,820
so you're going to find a lower time

687
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,659
frame PD array

688
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,299
inside of that breaker right so it's a

689
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,919
sort of an inverted breaker

690
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
you see the beauty

691
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,380
breaker disrespected and flipped into

692
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,679
support

693
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,899
Target is Breakers High

694
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,940
that is a key

695
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,460
key aspect of watching Breakers when you

696
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,380
trade them and you'll notice this by

697
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,279
yourself

698
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,320
is you never want to see them close

699
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,279
above the closing price of the breaker

700
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,779
all right you want to see them Wick

701
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,760
through let's let's find you

702
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,399
let's see if we can find a a breaker

703
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,840
nearby a valid correct breaker

704
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,640
there should be one nearby

705
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,500
not too far away

706
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,620
furthermore it is a it is a smaller time

707
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,940
frame

708
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,700
so it should be pretty quick

709
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,740
let's say this one for example

710
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,380
right

711
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,019
high low high or high

712
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,679
we close below this candle this specific

713
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,059
candle right

714
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,899
now this is where controversy comes in

715
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,580
breaker selection

716
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,100
right some people like to choose uh the

717
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,659
two candles together

718
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,880
some people like to pinpoint the exact

719
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,740
candle that caused the

720
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,679
The Purge

721
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,659
right

722
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,239
to be safe you can do this right I mean

723
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
the risk reward is still pretty good

724
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,980
but to be precise there's always a

725
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,918
specific candle responsible

726
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,020
right but for the sake of uh this

727
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,418
recording let's say it's uh

728
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,339
these two candles together

729
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,418
right look at the close of the breaker

730
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,599
and look at the respect price has for

731
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,960
the close

732
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,520
right

733
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,099
so as with the other PD arrays

734
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,980
quick quick quick

735
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,739
and fast decline

736
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,780
as with the other PD arrays the

737
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,780
invalidation of PD array starts from a

738
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,780
close above the mean

739
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,660
threshold of the PD array right the 50

740
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,280
percent

741
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
so that's a way to cut half of the stop

742
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
loss

743
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,400
all right that's the purpose of knowing

744
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,740
that it's not just thick of it it's not

745
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,500
just for the sake of knowing it

746
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,780
so that's a quick breaker

747
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,680
explanation

748
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,079
and let's find another example of a

749
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,780
valid breaker for the

750
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,140
for the sickness of

751
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,099
completion

752
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:42,119
[Music]

753
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,060
shouldn't take too long

754
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,579
let's use

755
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,640
a normal one first which is right here

756
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,740
right

757
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,359
you gotta you got a high you got a low

758
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,680
you got a higher high and you break

759
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,000
through it

760
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,320
this is your breaker

761
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,660
this entire candle

762
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,280
is your breaker

763
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,520
now

764
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,540
this is why uh the signs of the failure

765
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,920
of a breaker

766
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,980
are as follows number one

767
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,720
a close

768
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,300
above the close

769
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,900
right

770
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,980
but these weren't so convincing right

771
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,619
it's closing but it's uh

772
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,720
it's never closing twice for example

773
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,820
right it's never closing twice here

774
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,660
closed once

775
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,320
it's going deep huh

776
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,540
one two

777
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,920
one

778
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,800
a week double close and then it closes

779
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,859
back uh below

780
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,960
one only one strong one and then a

781
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,359
second one below right also respecting

782
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,339
the fifty percent

783
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:05,040
right so the number of closes is also an

784
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,540
important factor

785
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,359
of determining a real versus versus a

786
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,640
fake Break whether it's a breakout

787
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,280
whether it's a an invalidation of a PD

788
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,020
array

789
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,300
that is something I leave for your

790
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,680
studies

791
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,579
same over here

792
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,859
how many closes did it close

793
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,420
just one

794
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,599
right one close below one above and so

795
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,220
on

796
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,040
so

797
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
same over here

798
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,000
just one over here

799
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,119
and the second one is below and decline

800
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,180
also this

801
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,220
respect to this bearish pdra

802
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,400
the 50 of the pdra

803
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,440
was respected

804
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,760
measuring the body of course

805
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,240
[Music]

806
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,940
all right so the number of clothes

807
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,980
doesn't matter

808
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,380
the number of closes

809
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,300
matter

810
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,359
and let's find another breaker

811
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,420
here's some breaker drill

812
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,560
this one right here

813
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,420
you got a low you got a high you got a

814
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,599
lower low and you got a green or an up

815
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,359
close candle that caused The Purge this

816
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,920
is a beautiful

817
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,900
this is how the Ideal breaker looks like

818
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,119
right

819
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,160
a thick high volume bulky candle which

820
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,339
preceded the the violent move downwards

821
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,660
turtle soup

822
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,520
rally

823
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,339
as soon as you close twice above the

824
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,800
breaker one two

825
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,839
right and then it consolidates

826
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,260
so we've closed we've we've unlocked

827
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,839
so we think about it we've unlocked the

828
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,160
breaker right

829
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,560
and then we also created a PD array at

830
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,740
this High which is fpg

831
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,339
Fiji

832
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,200
plus breaker

833
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,839
plus breaking through this high

834
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,060
plus rejecting the slow

835
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,540
right so we're breaking through

836
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,119
bullish candles

837
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,040
we're getting support from bearish

838
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,480
candles

839
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,960
right

840
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,920
here

841
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,200
support

842
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,680
breaking through the bullish candles

843
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,060
rejecting lows

844
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,020
and breaking highs

845
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,960
so order Flow by all means is bullish

846
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,520
right here

847
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,380
you got this nice breaker

848
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,220
which happens to be

849
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,320
happening after a purge of the range Low

850
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,660
Range High

851
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,599
so the target is the Range High anyway

852
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,579
right

853
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,359
you had that

854
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,040
entry

855
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,800
stop loss Target

856
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,579
and so on

857
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,460
so

858
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,140
that's pretty much uh

859
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,440
all there is to this video took way too

860
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,880
long

861
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,060
it took way way too long

862
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,220
but it is what it is

863
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,619
the main takeaway was the main focus was

864
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,660
on The Naz trade idea

865
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,400
right which was

866
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,480
let's take a last

867
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,260
summary

868
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,200
go over here

869
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,859
delete remove all

870
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:15,900
drawings and

871
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,520
that's a forbidden word

872
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,599
so we're here

873
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,700
good old bar replay because it's all

874
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,260
hindsight right

875
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,460
it's all hindsight

876
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,520
over here

877
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,740
August High

878
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,020
we are breaking the high

879
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,700
order flow is is bullish on the

880
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,400
on the monthly or bullish

881
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,599
on the weekly

882
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,800
we are also bullish

883
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,500
right

884
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,420
on The Daily

885
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,700
we are breaking

886
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,520
the high

887
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,820
retracing into an f v g

888
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,000
after spending a considerable amount of

889
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,880
time

890
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,980
now do you know how much time that was

891
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,839
which we spent

892
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,280
over

893
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,040
here before actually flying

894
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,540
the amount of time we spent

895
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,960
before providing the real move was

896
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,619
after the break of course right

897
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,520
around 20 days

898
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
so this is a prime turtle soup example

899
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,579
just beautiful

900
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,800
right you could have been separated by

901
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,940
this one

902
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,560
but if you had to stop us down here

903
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,480
you'd be fine

904
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,000
or you could have waited for the month

905
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,880
uh you could have waited for a

906
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
for the next month to enter

907
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,079
right up here after the turtle soup

908
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,640
forms itself because you can use turtle

909
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,960
soup either as an entry or as a

910
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,300
confirmation for your bias so it's never

911
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,720
a bad idea to understand turtle soup

912
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,240
because it happens all the time

913
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,260
all the time

914
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,200
turtle soup

915
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,040
with an smt of course it's a failure

916
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,859
swing Turtles with the bodies

917
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,119
you got a turtle soup here

918
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,440
you get a turtle soup all the time

919
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,980
there's always a turtle soup somewhere

920
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,420
happening at a higher time frame PD

921
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,260
array

922
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,619
right

923
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,720
false breakdown

924
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,180
false breakdown you get the idea right

925
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,819
so it's never bad to understand turtle

926
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:21,960
soup

927
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,680
never

928
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,140
either to use it as an entry or as a

929
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,819
a confirmation for your bias

930
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:37,200
so the 20 40 6A look back we are purging

931
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,440
a 20-day low

932
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,660
right

933
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,160
so it's very unlikely that we keep

934
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,780
rattling just like that

935
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,260
right because price is always moving in

936
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,920
trend

937
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,359
range Trend range Trend range and so on

938
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,960
so

939
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,530
[Music]

940
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,720
the idea was

941
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,420
for the last final time

942
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,339
I haven't done a video for so long that

943
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,420
I just

944
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,060
keep ranting and ranting and talking and

945
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,680
talking

946
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,880
but

947
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,839
um

948
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,579
deal with it

949
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,540
that's what you get

950
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,760
you get this

951
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,640
the expectation is to

952
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,640
decline into the fvg

953
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,099
the pdra created at the High

954
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,200
and then a violent rally

955
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,220
stop loss over here

956
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,060
or here

957
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,220
because it's a turtle soup low

958
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,660
right

959
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,780
which which uh holds a lot of Trapped

960
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,599
liquidity down here

961
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,900
plus these two consecutive Down Candles

962
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,119
so it would be a reasonable stop loss to

963
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,200
keep it up here if you kept yourself

964
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,520
lost here I wouldn't blame you

965
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,800
over here is a simply safer

966
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,140
but here's also a good one here was a

967
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,119
good saw box with a higher risk to

968
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,140
reward

969
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,119
so you get that

970
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,180
you got a decline and you get a violent

971
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,400
rally

972
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,500

973
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,700

00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,160
is it a she is

975
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,920

976
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,060
but no one cares

977
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,260
so

978
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,619
