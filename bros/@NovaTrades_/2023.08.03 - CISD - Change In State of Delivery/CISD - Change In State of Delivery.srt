1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,460
hey guys welcome back to the channel

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,080
it's Nova trades it's been a while since

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,640
the last video but today I'll be

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,379
covering a topic that has been requested

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,019
many times it is Sisty or change in

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,900
state of delivery of price and so what

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,780
we have in front of me is NQ and this is

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,699
live price action

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,000
so what we're looking at is:
when can we identify the end phase of the manipulation ?
when does price start to expand in the direction for the daily and weekly candle bias ?

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,739
so from our weekly Outlook & seasonality wise
August into September tends to be slower for QQQ or NQ
and what we're looking for is a simple external into internal move

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,020
so with that being said

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,760
if we were to take a look at NQ on the

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,039
monthly you can see that we've rated

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,620
a monthly High into a monthly fair value

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,600
Gap so it

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
just to highlight it

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,739
sorry

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,840
there's the monthly fair value Gap and

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,420
there is the monthly pivot High

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,299
and so what we have right now is July

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,700
expanded higher so we have open low high

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,580
close and now we have August retracing

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,439
back into that move towards the

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,659
quarterly and monthly open

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,600
so what we're looking for is whether or

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,060
not August has the momentum to continue

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,460
this move higher but in order to do so

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,040
it's going to do a move from external

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,280
liquidity right above an external Range

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,360
High

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,520
which is this pivot high right here and

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,860
retrace back into internal liquidity now

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,720
because this is a monthly candle it is

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,939
likely to have some sort of weekly

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,979
imbalance or daily imbalance that price

46
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,780
can retrace back into

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,640
so if we go to the weekly time frame

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,560
here is our

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,759
weekly fair value Gap or busy

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
and this is our internal liquidity so

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
we've gone from a external liquidity by

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,799
taking out an old monthly High

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,560
so this is a monthly

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,379
all right let's fix that letter

55
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,920
oops

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,239
inside a monthly fair value Gap

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,280
and then we are now looking to see

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
whether or not price is willing to trade

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,720
back into internal liquidity so we had

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,060
this move last week where it dropped

61
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,280
into internal liquidity and try to

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,379
expand higher now this week what we're

63
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,700
looking for is whether or not we have

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,860
the momentum to continue the move higher

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,200
or whether we will reverse back down and

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
possibly go back lower once again to

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,540
pick up some more liquidity and how we

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,640
recognize that is by using syste to our

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,080
advantage our Changing State of delivery

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,239
of price so for those of you that are

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,400
familiar with the term but are not too

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,879
sure what it is it is simply defining

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,819
order blocks and when price has shifted

74
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,340
its way of delivering price so for

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,500
example let's say we're in an uptrend

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
what you're looking for is

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,379
and the easiest way to say it is you're

78
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,720
looking for an opposing

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,300
reaction meaning if price is trending up

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,220
you are looking for a displacement down

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,319
you're looking for an order block to

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,019
form that supports price down as soon as

83
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,000
you see that first order block form in

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,640
your higher time frame point of interest

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,140
that confirms a change of state of

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,700
delivery of price

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,980
uh at an aggressive point so for example

88
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,080
let's say that we're utilizing the

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
monthly FEG to identify when price is

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,000
likely to start trading back down we

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,940
know price is trading higher

92
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,099
with this move higher we are looking for

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,239
price to Signal a possible uh end to

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,760
this move up with a change in state of

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,500
delivery price so what I like to utilize

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,540
is the hourly chart so if we were to go

97
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
back to the hourly chart

98
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,940
we are looking for an opposing

99
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,440
price move

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,760
that is a price move that supports

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,540
a bearish order block and then forms a

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540
bearish PD array so going back to that

103
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,840
setup right here this is Wednesday July

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
19th of 2023

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,639
you see we have this attempt to move

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,180
higher one two three four times right on

107
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,979
the hourly time frame and then we get

108
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,080
this huge displacement down as soon as

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,780
this candle closes

110
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,419
and it engulfs this entire candle this

111
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,880
is our first bearish order block

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,259
by definition after we've taken out

113
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,360
external range liquidity

114
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,940
right in a higher time frame point of

115
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,100
Interest so a monthly fair value Gap

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,919
and a monthly order block to the left

117
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,800
and we had a massive displacement down

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,100
this also confirms our first bearish PD

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,540
array so let me get rid of this monthly

120
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,400
for Value go

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,139
because we know we're inside where we

122
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,160
want to be

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
so this first candle right here

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,020
this is your first order block that

125
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
forms

126
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,620
on this displacement lower

127
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,740
then we get the secondary candle that

128
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,820
closes

129
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,300
below the pivot low

130
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,720
so once this candle forms the downside

131
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,479
this is our

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,360
aggressive

133
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,039
meaning or changes to delivery price has

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,979
already begun when we are looking for a

135
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,800
clear confirmation we are looking for

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
the complete PD array to form that is we

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,780
go and if you're not familiar with this

138
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,539
it's in the previous video that I'll

139
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,759
have released maybe a month ago and I'll

140
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,900
link in the description below that

141
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,060
regards uh PD arrays and how they all

142
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,680
form but we can do a quick review right

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,580
here

144
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,259
external

145
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,120
high is rated

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,759
data rejection block forms

147
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,680
right so you have this rejection block

148
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,780
forming with this Wick

149
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,639
so here is

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,440
external

151
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,560
uh High

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,000
you have

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,539
rejection

154
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,699
so if price somehow managed to trade

155
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,919
back up above this line we'd expect them

156
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,479
to defend

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
this close and this open of these hourly

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,500
candles

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,259
so here's the OB we'll get rid of that

160
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,900
so external High rejection then what

161
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,500
comes next after a rejection forms is

162
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,419
your displacement lower and your order

163
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,500
block

164
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,400
so here's your OB

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,139
right and because it's a bearish or we

166
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,340
will put a minus sign beside it

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
then comes your

168
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,960
value yet

169
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,360
so we have one two three four components

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
we are looking for a pivot low to be

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
broken so the pivot low that forms this

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,500
pivot high is broken right there with

173
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,539
this confirmed on closed candle

174
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,520
and so we have a market structure shift

175
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,560
once this closes

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
and we have what is also going to be a

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,060
low high lower low after rating external

178
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,039
liquidity so we are going to have a

179
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,680
breaker right breaker or mitigation and

180
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,699
in this sense

181
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,500
you can look at

182
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,660
these down cools candles here

183
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,819
aligned with this OB here and so this

184
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,800
general area is going to act as your

185
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,300
mitigation

186
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,720
right because of how messy uh the Wicks

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
are in regards to or in relation to

188
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
where the bodies are we're going to say

189
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,800
that this area in general

190
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,740
are about to highlight this area

191
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,160
is going to provide the mitigation

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,220
so we have mitigation

193
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,900
and in breaker block we have liquidity

194
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,400
void or fair value Gap we have order

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
block we have rejection we have external

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,560
High so we have a complete PD array form

197
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,419
with respect to

198
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,039
uh

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,259
a bearish PDA reform with respect to

200
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,259
this bullish move higher so this is the

201
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,380
first opposing PD array opposing means

202
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,300
opposing the current direction

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,800
of price

204
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,780
this is the first opposing PDA that has

205
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,240
formed and is signaling aligned with the

206
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,940
economic calendar a possible retracement

207
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,599
from external liquidity into internal

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
liquidity and where does internal Equity

209
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,039
lie right underneath here

210
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,700
in the form of all of these imbalances

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,099
right so if we were to take

212
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,140
this move here

213
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,719
and Define the PD array

214
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,060
oops

215
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,480
all right

216
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,640
we took external liquidity with Wix on

217
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
the hourly time frame and we displaced

218
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,320
back lower so now we have our confirmed

219
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,019
change in state of delivery of price

220
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,540
so here is the confirmed move right

221
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,519
there

222
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,220
right so this is our sister

223
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,040
the more conservative approach to it

224
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,660
right

225
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,399
and so

226
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,959
this is your Market structure shift but

227
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,140
this is also indicating that price is

228
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,620
now aligned with the economic calendar

229
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,080
ready to move back lower and retrace

230
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,779
back into a discount oops this should be

231
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,640
flipped I just realized that

232
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,740
so let's do that like this whoops there

233
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,860
we go back into a discount and a

234
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,839
discount liquidity pool so we're looking

235
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,180
for price to retrace back into

236
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,779
uh this busy right here this hourly fair

237
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,180
value Gap to the upside

238
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,300
and so what happens is once price forms

239
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,459
it retraces back into that mitigation

240
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,580
slash breaker area almost Taps the order

241
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,260
block body

242
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,680
Rejects and then we have this overnight

243
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,459
move lower

244
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,019
right and then we get this uh

245
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,959
continuation into the next day with the

246
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,700
gap down and it trades all the way into

247
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,860
discount so there is your first complete

248
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,980
move that opposes the price action

249
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,019
leading up to this uh CISD right here

250
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,320
so this is from July

251
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,339
19th right now here it is again

252
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,320
albeit this time it's a little bit

253
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
different because it doesn't take out

254
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,360
the old high but it does take out an old

255
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
weekly high so for example

256
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,820
here is our

257
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
weekly High

258
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,560
previously High

259
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,779
price is currently trying to expand

260
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,019
higher after the sell-off

261
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,060
and look what happens right we reprice

262
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,980
all the way back up to the

263
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,320
inefficiencies over here and almost into

264
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,800
this Gap right it almost touches that uh

265
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,079
gap down so that would be a daily Vib

266
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,540
that is formed right here from Wednesday

267
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,700
sorry from the Wednesday session into

268
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,980
the Thursday session we form a daily bib

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,200
it almost Taps into it doesn't

270
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,220
and what we're looking for is

271
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,440
confirmation of a

272
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,740
change in state of delivery of price so

273
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,320
here's the load that forms as high and

274
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,940
we don't displace below it so we don't

275
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,620
have a confirmed

276
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,380
uh PD array that forms however we do

277
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,880
have

278
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,060
an aggressive approach to our changes

279
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,360
data deal of your price with right here

280
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
so this up close candle the rage

281
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,620
liquidity is completely displaced

282
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,399
through

283
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,140
and what you'll notice is we have

284
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,500
external liquidity taken we have

285
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,060
a rejection

286
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,060
the possibly forms right here

287
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,260
so we can label it

288
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,600
and what we're looking for next is

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,980
uh

290
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,380
displacement lower which we have we have

291
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,680
liquidity void or fair value Gap

292
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,180
on the hourly time frame right here

293
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,120
and we need

294
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
a

295
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,079
mitigation slash breaker deform and so

296
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,360
we need to see a low break

297
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
and an hourly bodily candle bodily uh

298
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,300
sorry candle body to close below that

299
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,920
low so in this instance

300
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,839
we don't get that move until right

301
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,399
around here

302
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,019
so here's the low that forms this high

303
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,760
and then we get this overnight move

304
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,700
lower heading into Tuesday of this week

305
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,000
so this is our first complete bearish PD

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,180
array that forms however our aggressive

307
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,540
60 right when our first opposing order

308
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,839
block that is farmed on uh

309
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,540
the open on Sunday into Monday overnight

310
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,200
has held up into Monday's trading and

311
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
Tuesday overnight

312
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,160
and then we get the confirmed hourly

313
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,579
displacement lower so now we have

314
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,540
our bearish PD array form

315
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,060
with respect to this move right here and

316
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,320
then we get the complete

317
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
bodily close

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,339
right here heading into Tuesday am

319
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,220
so we have our complete system now

320
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,860
with relation to the structure up here

321
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,779
so there's a rejection this previous

322
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,240
week high is also your external

323
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,820
you have your fair value Gap and now you

324
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,180
have your mitigation and breaker

325
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,740
so if I were to take this and then draw

326
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,839
it straight across

327
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,800
that's going to be your breaker

328
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
why is your breaker because this is the

329
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,560
low

330
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,200
that urges an old weekly High

331
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,139
and then this is the hourly confirmation

332
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,760
of a change in state of delivery of

333
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,800
price that occurs right on the more

334
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,480
conservative event so what we're looking

335
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,940
for is price to retrace back up into a

336
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,200
breaker

337
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,480
which also happens to have

338
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,760
fair value Gap or consecutive fair value

339
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,000
gaps so what you can do is

340
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,959
you can mark off all the way up to

341
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,940
where these fair value gaps form so let

342
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,959
me do the other way actually that's

343
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,000
right that's right

344
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and we get into a premium right there

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
and so this is your premium fear value

346
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,320
Gap portion and up here is your premium

347
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,980
of your fair value Gap portion so these

348
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,440
are the fair value gaps of interest of

349
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,660
trying to engage price in a short and

350
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,220
very similar to what was happening up

351
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,980
here see how we have one two three four

352
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,380
drives higher with wix

353
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,220
we are looking for one two three four

354
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,800
five drives higher into a premium fair

355
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,459
value Gap inside a breaker after a

356
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,139
confirmed

357
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,300
bearish PD array or change in state of

358
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,680
delivery of price has been established

359
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,899
and so what we're looking for is shorts

360
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,560
to engage price uh from premium into

361
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,079
discount now the way price action

362
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,880
actually developed this day we didn't

363
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,639
get that sell-off until after hours due

364
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,740
to some news so they made it very

365
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,079
convenient to load up on puts all day

366
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
and then capitalize on those puts the

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,260
following day

368
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,279
so that is your hourly confirmation and

369
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,560
a retracement back up into your first

370
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,139
attempt to short and move down now then

371
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,699
what happens is overnight we get the gap

372
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,560
down and we obviously

373
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,100
then end up dropping into what

374
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,839
actually this is a swing low that starts

375
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,160
all this move

376
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,500
a discount right so we automatically

377
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,980
drop off into a liquidity pool of

378
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,420
discount liquidity by taking out these

379
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,920
hourly pivots

380
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,779
and then what happens then we retrace

381
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,480
and then we continue the confirm move

382
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,760
now so then what we're looking for is if

383
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,100
we want to play a continuation off this

384
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,660
move but you have to apply the same

385
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,279
logic here's a swing High

386
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,920
here's the swing low we are looking for

387
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,339
a premium engagement of this leg down so

388
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,480
there's premium

389
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,060
here is an hourly fair value Gap and we

390
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,699
want to see on the lower time frame now

391
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,220
a way to engage price

392
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,420
uh

393
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,079
inside the structure so here is

394
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,839
the week close of an hourly candle and

395
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,760
then we have this down close so this

396
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,779
confirms

397
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,420
that this is now an order block

398
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,060
and so we want to engage price with

399
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,760
respect to the structure

400
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,920
into a downside

401
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,259
heading into Wednesday equities open so

402
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,040
if we're going five minute

403
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,540
and then go back here

404
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,940
so here's the premium portion

405
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,920
right so New York attempts to trade

406
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,980
higher actually let me turn on

407
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,839
there we go

408
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,940
so New York attempts to trade higher

409
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,480
back into the hourly fair value Gap

410
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,180
and then what we're looking for is on

411
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,160
the 15 or five minute time frame with

412
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,439
respect to that area we are looking for

413
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
an order block to form

414
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
so here is that move right here so we

415
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,099
have a candle that fully engulfs the

416
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,240
previous candles that's an outside

417
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,740
candle or outside bar

418
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,839
and so this right here is piercing of

419
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,599
Premium liquidity a failure to displace

420
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,760
higher and then you have your first

421
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,919
little confirmation of an order block

422
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,919
and so this is an aggressive

423
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,080
lower time frame

424
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
idea of a

425
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,140
system now I'm doing it from the body

426
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,299
you can do it from the wick as well so

427
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,260
it's not going to change much

428
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,160
and so now what you're looking for is 15

429
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,440
minute order flow to confirm that it

430
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,760
wants to move lower

431
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,840
so you have

432
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,419
your rejection forming though

433
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,580
right we've had liquidity sweep

434
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,919
right here above an old pivot into

435
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,720
premium

436
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,120
so we have external high right with

437
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,640
relation to this 15 minute

438
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,679
leg down right here

439
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,419
so we've taken out the liquidity of this

440
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,559
leg

441
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,539
we have our first little rejection area

442
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,960
for me

443
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,360
we have our order block that forms what

444
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,039
this displacement lower now we we're now

445
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,480
we're looking for a fair value Gap so

446
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,679
it's right here

447
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,900
tiny little one on the 15 minute time

448
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,299
frame so there's our first little

449
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,860
liquidity void fair value Gap

450
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,780
so we'll do that

451
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,900
and we're looking for

452
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,299
a low

453
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,860
to the swing High to be broken to

454
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,980
confirm bearish order flow

455
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,299
so this is the conservative

456
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,799
system right

457
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,620
so we have a low high lower low so now

458
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,160
we have our mitigation

459
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,500
right slash breaker we have a rejection

460
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,539
block at the high our order block at the

461
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,140
high we have a fair value up at the High

462
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,820
we have very aggressive approach to an

463
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,919
entry at the high with this SD right so

464
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,299
the first order block that forms after

465
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,220
piercing liquidity and then we have our

466
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,140
confirmation down here and as you can

467
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,460
see

468
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
price immediately sells off and doesn't

469
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,240
really give a retracement at all

470
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,100
into this move

471
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,660
so the only way to have entered this

472
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,760
move would have been pre-market

473
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,400
with relation to news

474
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,679
and then if you were aggressive in your

475
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,679
approach to the open and you saw that as

476
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,260
price move lower and close below up

477
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,039
close candles so as price closed below

478
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,500
these up close candles the subsequent

479
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,480
candle should respect the previous up

480
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
close candle right so that's an order

481
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,900
block that's an order block so it

482
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,700
touches the order block rejects touches

483
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,620
the orderable order block and rejects

484
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,900
right touches the order block and

485
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,520
rejects so you're looking for these

486
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,320
Clues on the 15 minute time frame to

487
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,179
engage price on the five or one

488
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
so then going back to that area now that

489
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,799
we have a label on the 15

490
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,539
we can kind of dive down into the five

491
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,760
minute time frame and we'll so here's

492
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,960
your five minute order block that

493
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,780
pierces into that liquidity right and

494
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,280
here's your down close candle so now you

495
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,900
have a confirmed

496
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,000
order block on the five minute

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,220
that you can utilize too

498
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,380
start developing your PD array and so

499
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,360
then this is your five minute fair value

500
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,440
Gap

501
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,160
right here

502
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,720
and you have displacement lower you

503
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,580
break an old low so the five minute

504
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,500
confirms that it wants to move lower for

505
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,020
the time being right and we're using the

506
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,860
hourly time frame

507
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,140
sorry

508
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,720
we're using the hourly time frame to

509
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
determine that price is likely to go

510
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,980
lower and continue to move lower until

511
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,080
it hits a

512
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,539
discount sell side liquidity pool on a

513
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:04,860
higher time frame so such as the daily

514
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,120
or weekly

515
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,760
swing lows

516
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,960
so then back to the five minute

517
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,320
all right so now that we're here

518
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,740
we've had news in here and we're looking

519
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,380
for confirmation of the order flow which

520
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,840
we're getting on the 15s and the hour so

521
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,700
now in the five minute we have our high

522
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,820
purges and to a fair value Gap

523
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
right there

524
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,419
so barely enters into the fair Valley

525
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,659
Gap rejects displaces lower closes below

526
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,280
this up close candle so now this becomes

527
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,419
an order block

528
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,400
and we want to see the fair value Gap we

529
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,919
want to see price enter it close weekly

530
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,140
and then engage prices so once we see

531
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,820
this weakness in the five minute just

532
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,760
prior to open you can now start to

533
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,080
engage price so if I'm going to replay

534
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,659
and I go here

535
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,559
and then go to one minute

536
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,140
so you can see here's the piercing of

537
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,100
liquidity

538
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,919
and then we close below it and then you

539
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,659
can see how this candle try to move

540
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,580
higher in respect to the structure that

541
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,900
has formed inside

542
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,760
then it forms another fair value Gap

543
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
right there

544
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,900
price enters it and if we're looking for

545
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,940
lower prices the open should and now

546
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,620
this could also happen it could induce

547
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,640
higher

548
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,919
and then drop lower right that can also

549
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,360
happen so that's why it sometimes it's

550
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,860
better to wait for the open I usually

551
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,720
always wait for the open I can engage

552
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
price and catch it later on

553
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
um so that I don't get prematurely

554
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,539
stopped out

555
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,520
then what happens is here's the open

556
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,679
right so that's an immediate move down

557
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,140
in a way and you want to see it continue

558
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,640
you don't want to see it come back up

559
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,419
again

560
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,940
and then there's your second move down

561
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,500
and then obviously you get a little bit

562
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
of retracement

563
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,860
but now we have our fair value Gap that

564
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,020
is formed right off the open so if price

565
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,280
is going to

566
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,559
try to move lower you want to see

567
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,780
weakness out of the fair value Gap and

568
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,840
so now you can engage price based on the

569
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,720
weakness of this candle

570
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,460
and once you engage price you're in

571
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,080
short from here

572
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,440
so if you take a short position tool

573
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,480
right once this candle closes you can

574
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,520
place your stop at the high so 15 Point

575
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
stop

576
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
and with respect to price you are

577
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,900
targeting

578
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,299
right the low that is formed previously

579
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,880
so this is a 52 and a half point

580
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,720
set up with a 15.75 stop loss so you

581
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,179
have a three R trade setup

582
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,559
now

583
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,900
price is being volatile and it's

584
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,760
inefficient it could come out take you

585
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,640
out once more and then drop it lower so

586
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,200
you have to be cautious with these so as

587
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
soon as price starts to displace lower

588
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,280
you want to see a confirmed move lower

589
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,840
again you don't want to see a stall out

590
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
here so

591
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,980
if we move lower again perfect so we

592
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,200
have one move and two moves but notice

593
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,520
how there's Wicks forming at the lows

594
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,380
you don't want to see this move

595
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,720
aggressively back up again however you

596
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,880
have another fair value Gap

597
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,820
to now help you with your bearish order

598
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,980
flow to the downside so it could retrace

599
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,600
you want to see a retrace that's all

600
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,100
right you want to see a respect the

601
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,080
order block and you want to see it move

602
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
down

603
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,260
so in this instance it just kept moving

604
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,059
down and it hit the target so that's

605
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,799
perfect you're out so

606
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,140
even if we didn't take any entries here

607
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,240
right

608
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,740
all we have to do is wait for

609
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,280
confirmation

610
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,780
by the means of displacement right

611
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,120
energetic moves away from an area of

612
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,280
Interest right so if you're bullish you

613
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
want to see this these kind of areas

614
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,059
hold sweep and move higher but if you're

615
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,620
bearish you want to see confirmed

616
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,960
extended moves lower retracements

617
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,380
weakness extended moves lower right you

618
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,480
don't want to see it do

619
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,799
uh

620
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,240
chop stuff right where it comes like

621
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,820
here comes back up to here then tries to

622
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,620
do this and then goes lower right you

623
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,100
don't want to see that so this is a very

624
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,220
energetic and efficient move lower

625
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,320
but the clues to what was happening

626
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,140
started to form here for this session in

627
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,500
New York

628
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,760
so going back to the 15 minute time

629
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,059
frame

630
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,380
and obviously in terms of this entire

631
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,380
hourly leg we're looking for premium

632
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,240
premium liquidity above an old high

633
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,240
right in terms of this range

634
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,860
and then we want to see our first little

635
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,419
order block form so that's your

636
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,919
aggressive change in state of delivery

637
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,620
price so soon as you see that form based

638
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,440
on a hourly uh

639
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,179
hourly structure

640
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,100
so there's your hourly order block as

641
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
formed at the same time you want to see

642
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,960
confirmed order flow of price willing to

643
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,179
move lower and that is just simply by

644
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,760
observing price reject order blocks fair

645
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,500
value gaps

646
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,380
and continue to move lower

647
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,659
so you can see that we had this nice low

648
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,419
move up into news and then once that

649
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,159
occurred we start to deliver back down

650
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,419
with aggression and then if you wanted

651
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,000
to see the rest you can see that

652
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
right we sold off all the way into

653
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,179
a daily fair value Gap right

654
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,100
but yeah that was that move but the

655
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,799
confirmation of the entire week's move

656
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,480
started up here right so there's a whole

657
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,980
bunch of consolidation

658
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,860
that's occurring so this is untradable

659
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,320
the only trade that I was able to take

660
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,760
was the short here I think and

661
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,460
I actually missed this NQ move but I was

662
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,520
able to capture a move on rty instead so

663
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,659
my focus was on rty because NQ had moved

664
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,440
without me and I uh I missed the entry

665
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,539
at the open by like

666
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,159
uh fractions of a tick

667
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,600
so this is basically seconds right I

668
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,159
just was too slow to pull the trigger

669
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,220
but this is how you use syste on the

670
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,860
hourly time frame to identify when price

671
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,200
starts to oppose the move that has

672
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,080
happened and confirms when it is likely

673
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,880
to go from external to internal and

674
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,220
internal back into external so now if we

675
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,799
go back to live price action

676
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,640
for the date of August 3rd

677
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I want to point out that we have

678
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,620
on the weekly time frame we've taken out

679
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,080
an old weekly law right we entered into

680
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
the weekly fair value Gap so here is

681
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,820
okay let me use

682
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,320
the horizontal Ray so it stays annotated

683
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,360
previous week's law so that's external

684
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,779
liquidity

685
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,080
so there's external liquidity

686
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,220
and

687
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,520
a failure to display slower right here

688
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,559
and what happens is you have an outside

689
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,720
candle that forms so it's an engulfs the

690
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,980
previous candle

691
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,140
and so you have an aggressive

692
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,039
syste right here

693
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,400
however it's albeit price is still

694
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,080
supporting Bearer structure we haven't

695
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,020
taken out the old hourly hi-hat and so

696
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,779
this is an aggressive way to approach a

697
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,760
possible short-term low being put in so

698
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,460
a failed swing lower and in fact we had

699
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,919
diversions with es here

700
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,840
so there's some sort of versions of the

701
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
lows

702
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,779
and then what you're looking for is

703
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,240
price to start to expand higher

704
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,120
and retrace back into what internal

705
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,400
liquidity so we go from external to

706
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,840
internal and internal into external

707
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,580
that's it

708
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,020
uh where is it right here

709
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,600
so what do you think price is likely

710
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,039
trying to do right here

711
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,559
see this high and see this high

712
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,600
it is likely trying to go for the Asian

713
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,919
Range High

714
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,960
and into an internal liquidity pool so

715
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,240
above an old high so the displacement

716
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,700
that occurred from yesterday is now

717
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,960
being repriced back into

718
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,559
simply it

719
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,720
we've gone from external and now we're

720
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,779
going back into internal now this setup

721
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,399
here isn't going to be clean because

722
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,380
it's fighting the down move

723
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,200
and is trying to establish

724
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
a retracement move higher

725
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,140
so you can see that it's pretty volatile

726
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,200
it trades up then trades lower trades up

727
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,760
trades lower and then finally

728
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,340
establishes a break of this high and

729
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,700
then you have respective structure

730
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,919
on the lower time frame so we have the

731
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,080
aggressive cyste and then we finally

732
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,440
have an approach on the five minute that

733
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,919
confirms that it is now willing to or at

734
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,200
least trying to move higher so it trades

735
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,720
above that high creates a fair value Gap

736
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,860
and then for about

737
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,740
an hour it ranges inside that and then

738
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,960
finally breaks out into the PM session

739
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,880
and it's breaking out to do what

740
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,039
attack and internal liquidity pool

741
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,600
and so that has been

742
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,399
the idea of syste

743
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,899
two approaches

744
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,779
once when you have an order block form

745
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,299
that opposes what the current price

746
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,799
action has been doing so for example

747
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,659
we've been trading down

748
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,820
and so we have

749
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,799
there's this order block

750
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,659
however we still haven't taken up high

751
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,399
yet so what we want to see is price

752
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,159
trade higher come back test it

753
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,679
create a failed swing lower

754
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,919
and then confirm and move back higher

755
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,200
and so now we're getting a bullish PD

756
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,820
array forming

757
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,799
into

758
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,919
this down move that has occurred all

759
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:05,640
week

760
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,899
right so external back into internal

761
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,419
and the way to approach it on the five

762
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,760
minute would have been what we just

763
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,200
covered right here

764
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,940
now you could have played it down here

765
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,580
too with more aggressiveness that is if

766
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,440
you are expecting

767
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,200
price to hold and move higher this is

768
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,460
where your aggressive approach

769
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,460
approaches would have been now if um

770
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,080
because we have the hourly order block

771
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,000
60 right here you're looking for some

772
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,260
sort of bullish

773
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,260
five minute PD array to form

774
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,720
or five minute supportive structure to

775
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,260
form to help you gauge an entry point uh

776
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,820
I didn't like anything in here today the

777
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,380
only thing I liked was actually the

778
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,240
short move from here back down and when

779
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,520
it failed uh

780
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,580
you had been stopped out for uh while

781
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,039
doing a stream it was about 55 and a

782
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,960
half points and if you captured the bulk

783
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,220
of it you would have gone in like 79

784
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,600
points

785
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,559
um but caution was also aired once we

786
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,840
saw price being supported here

787
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,419
chances are we are most likely due to

788
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,179
the inability of NQ to drive lower to

789
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,919
try pushing back higher into internal

790
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,059
liquidity

791
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,559
and so we're getting that move now and

792
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,760
so this is what it looks like on hourly

793
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,919
now so very messy

794
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,640
right in terms of the hourly Wix but if

795
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,220
you apply that logic right where you see

796
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,779
an order block form on the hourly time

797
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,880
frame and then you wait for a 15 minute

798
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,740
or five minute structure to support

799
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,260
price action higher

800
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
uh

801
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,880
you can and you will over Time Capture

802
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,039
big expansion moves now there's nothing

803
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,799
Pleasant about this

804
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,640
because we are going against

805
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,440
the entire move

806
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,419
for the week however this is also

807
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,100
signaling that chances are we are most

808
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,720
likely done selling off for the week as

809
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,700
well so we're probably going to end up

810
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,279
range Bound by range but I mean back

811
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,059
into what has already transpired so just

812
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,039
before I shut this video off another

813
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,659
thing you want to point out is that we

814
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,039
do have this trendline liquidity that's

815
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,080
formed all week and it seems to be

816
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,360
piercing it just now as well

817
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,059
so if we were to delete everything here

818
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,320
and simply just

819
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,840
address

820
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,500
the discount and premium

821
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,720
from the highs

822
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,700
to the lows

823
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,519
chances are we are probably going to try

824
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,260
to trade back into a premium

825
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,299
liquidity

826
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,720
pool or fair value Gap or order block

827
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
into Friday

828
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,779
and

829
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,460
so we're probably going to move up into

830
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,580
here and then it'll probably try to or

831
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,559
attempt to sell back down again right

832
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,419
and it'll probably get trapped in this

833
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,620
area somewhere between here and here

834
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,380
but yeah so that is uh how you use systy

835
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,919
to help you identify what is likely to

836
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,418
occur

837
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,280
in terms of price going from external

838
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,780
liquidity into internal liquidity

839
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,099
internal Equity back into external

840
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,060
liquidity

841
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,280
uh one thing I need to point out is that

842
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,020
if you're bearish then you want to see

843
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,940
raids of old highs hold

844
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,280
and then confirm to move lower if you're

845
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,760
bullish you can get a move like this

846
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,739
retraces into discount

847
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,899
and then begins to move higher again at

848
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,639
that point what you're looking for is a

849
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,099
confirmed hourly PD area back to the

850
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,739
upside similar to What's Happening Here

851
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,260
and the PD array is always going to be

852
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,580
the same it's going to be external

853
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,599
liquidity

854
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,339
rejection block

855
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,260
displacement that creates an order block

856
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,418
then you get some sort of liquidity void

857
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,339
or fair value Gap then you get your

858
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,260
breaker or mitigation that forms and so

859
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,839
if you look here here's your high here's

860
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,879
your low here's your higher high break

861
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,320
your medication

862
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,660
order block displacement

863
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,119
or waiting for a fair value Gap or a

864
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,740
liquidity point to be

865
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,180
created

866
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,220
and then we will have a confirmed

867
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,320
bullish PD array for the move into

868
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,880
Friday

869
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,380
hope you guys have enjoyed the video it

870
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,720
might be a little lengthy and obviously

871
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,339
my communication wasn't as crystal clear

872
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:18,780
I did Mumble a little bit I apologize

873
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,079
for that but the idea is there in the

874
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,339
video and if you guys have any questions

875
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,380
please do post them below or you can ask

876
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,700
me in my Discord

877
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,140
uh which will be linked in the

878
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,359
description or you can just DM me on

879
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,000
Twitter although I do suggest Discord is

880
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,099
the best route for that and I'll see you

881
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,660
guys next time

882
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,839
thank you
