at charts all day yeah eventually that

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,920

knowing that you are you you've I

85
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,319
suppose the way you explain uh ICT is

86
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,560
among the sort of simplest ways that

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
people are explaining it I.E you've

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,220
simplified the whole thing down so we're

89
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,500
going to get into your journey today and

90
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,180
find out man how you managed to do it

91
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,260
why you managed to do it how you even

92
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
found this ICT dude uh and all this sort

93
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,819
of stuff so do you want to start off

94
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,580
with uh how you found trading and I

95
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,660
believe it so that some kind of

96
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,459
interesting story at the beach

97
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,340
yeah yeah so I found training 10 years

98
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,480
ago uh when I met my partner and

99
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,000
um I didn't feel any attraction towards

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,620
trading because I've always felt like it

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,019
was a male dominated uh industry and uh

102
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,959
but about four maybe five years later we

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,420
were at the beach uh vacation and

104
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,099
something really strange happened where

105
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,040
a guy out of the nowhere came at me and

106
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,019
he told me

107
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,040
um that he knows me from trading in

108
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,599
South Africa and I said no you you're

109
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,239
confusing me with someone else uh then

110
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,580
you know we just didn't consider that

111
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
something important and then when I got

112
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,620
back home in uh in Bucharest after the

113
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,980
vacation was over I actually uh was

114
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,080
approached by a trading group from South

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,799
Africa uh I left that group yeah it was

116
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,739
really really weird it was really weird

117
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,560
yeah I was I was approached on WhatsApp

118
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,680
which is unusual because usually in this

119
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,418
industry people approach usually on

120
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,339
telegram I didn't even have telegram at

121
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,880
that time so these guys approached me on

122
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,979
Whatsapp I don't know how they got my

123
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,780
number so I started looking into their

124
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,220
strategy they were trading something

125
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,900
like beat the market maker from Steve

126
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,940
Morrow

127
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,040
um so that's how I started with trading

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,740
and uh then from from that point till

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,639
today it was a long trip and can you

130
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,800
even do you even know why why I know

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
somebody came up to you saying oh you're

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,900
yeah I have no idea no absolutely no

133
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,139
idea very wonderful at that time yeah at

134
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,880
that time in Romania I remember that

135
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,220
there were some protests

136
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,020
um you know Romanian people were

137
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,820
protesting because uh the government

138
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,080
wanted to uh you know do something silly

139
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,900
and uh this guy uh because he's um

140
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
girlfriend came then afterwards uh you

141
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,340
know to take him away from there because

142
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,040
he was really acting weird and then she

143
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,800
told us she apologized for the incident

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,259
and then she told us you know

145
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,880
um he was acting weird because he's

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,620
really stressed with his job he was

147
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,180
working uh

148
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,400
um law enforcement and because of the

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
protests and all of that he was really

150
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,840
so yeah she just said he's acting weird

151
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,360
we don't know why and the weird thing is

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
that we were at the beach in Romania

153
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,699
they were Romanians but he approached me

154
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,080
in English

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,220
which was super weird ah that is kind of

156
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,440
odd you even wonder if like

157
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,259
it's some sort of scam it was some kind

158
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,240
of scam yeah but then it's like how when

159
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
I said would they get your phone number

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,300
if they were going to watch it exactly

161
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,820
everything exactly you know Steve Morrow

162
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,800
beat the market maker ain't exactly

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
exactly that's weird there's very weird

164
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,020
but anyway very weird obviously a sign

165
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,360
because you're here and this you know

166
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,900
yes if the guy's watching then hey you

167
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,340
know reach out in the comments and let

168
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,919
us know why and if you did that and who

169
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,960
was the sort of doppelganger Trader from

170
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,220
South Africa I don't think he even

171
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,500
remembers yeah

172
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,979
um okay so so um so you you you sort of

173
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,380
it's delved into things but didn't I

174
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,780
mean what what happened next

175
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,500
what happened next is that I studied for

176
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,720
about three months with the people in

177
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,039
that group

178
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,319
um uh btmm strategy it was very much um

179
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
indicator based uh that's what caught my

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
attention uh because it was indicator

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,259
based and I really like geometry

182
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,560
um so indicators all of that stuff it

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,440
looked very mathematical to me but then

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,340
when my boyfriend found ICT

185
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,319
um we started looking at uh you know

186
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,240
consuming his content on YouTube and

187
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,380
then I felt like trading with indicators

188
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,100
is uh not the best way to do it so then

189
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,440
I was very interested in looking at

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
naked charts I felt like uh that's what

191
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,319
the next stage would be in my developing

192
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,860
Journey so that's where I decided to

193
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,160
leave the group because I also came in

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,099
in that group with my own ideas you know

195
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,780
maybe we should use this indicator or

196
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,340
maybe we shouldn't rely on indicators

197
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,080
that much maybe we should look more at

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,479
naked charts and that wasn't really seen

199
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,639
with good eyes so then I decided that

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,060
it's time to you know part ways and uh

201
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,720
from that moment we studied ICT

202
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,840
uh on YouTube went into his mentorship

203
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,599
didn't finish it because of uh financial

204
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,160
difficulties

205
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,419
and then we just continued to study uh

206
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,900
from his YouTube from the free

207
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,380
um stuff that he had on YouTube and in

208
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,900
about six months I think

209
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,380
um we started applying it and when I

210
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,900
opened the charts uh I was like really

211
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,720
really eager to apply everything that I

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
believed that I understood took notes I

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
still have two big notebooks that are

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,879
that are filled with um uh with

215
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,560
indications and all the stuff that I

216
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
understood at that time but when I

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,580
started to apply it in uh in the markets

218
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,919
even in back testing

219
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,580
um the results were not as I expected

220
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,620
I'm not talking about results as in the

221
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,559
trade results but more like I didn't

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,760
feel like I was uh 100

223
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,980
sure of what I was doing I still felt

224
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,860
that I had doubts I still felt that I'm

225
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,959
not looking at the right things I still

226
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,320
felt like I'm uh not understanding

227
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,260
concepts correctly and I always always

228
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,740
had uh conflicting signals something

229
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,839
told me to buy something else told me to

230
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,459
sell at the same time

231
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,100
because I was trying to eat all the

232
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,720
candies yeah at one time

233
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,320
do you think it was part of like not

234
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,860
finishing the the paid mentorship no no

235
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,500
absolutely not I think that ict's

236
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,140
content regardless if we're talking

237
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,660
about paid mentorship or free YouTube

238
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,580
stuff I think that it's like an

239
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,339
encyclopedia it encompasses everything

240
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,760
that someone can know not that they need

241
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,620
to know but any everything that someone

242
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,920
can actually get to know uh retail you

243
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,160
know Wise about the markets but it may

244
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,800
be even more than retail but um

245
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,260
I always felt like a kid in the candy

246
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,279
store I wanted to eat you know basically

247
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,080
apply everything at the same time

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,740
because charts are like books full of

249
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,380
words and sentences and they will have a

250
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,720
certain meaning if you use them in a

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,779
certain context and I didn't see the

252
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,820
importance of context at that time so

253
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,680
that's why I wanted to use everything at

254
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
the same time and when you do that you

255
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,620
just

256
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,899
it's going to be a total mush in your

257
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,420
head yeah yeah and the results are going

258
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,660
to speak you know and so you did even

259
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,279
get past the back testing phase at that

260
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,320
point where you know you said before

261
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,940
that you couldn't even make it work in

262
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,760
back testing and how did that yes I did

263
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,399
I did practicing at some point when I

264
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,459
started to exclude stuff I decided to

265
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,700
use less of the concepts that I learned

266
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,220
uh from his content I decided to use

267
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,660
less and

268
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,760
um started to focus more on back testing

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
I said okay I'm just going to leave

270
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
um you know live trading uh set it aside

271
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
for uh for a few weeks maybe a few

272
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,480
months uh back testing started going out

273
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,380
pretty well but then when I uh felt

274
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,420
confident or that's what I thought at

275
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,000
that moment that I felt confident uh and

276
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,140
again

277
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,720
um increased My Equity uh through

278
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,680
depositing and I started trading live uh

279
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,680
it went good for about a month and then

280
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,160
it was not that good anymore because I

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
came back to my old habits of trying to

282
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,279
use everything at the same time thinking

283
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,500
that you know overconfidence right I

284
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,660
became overconfident and that really

285
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,540
hurt me because you said you you lost

286
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,120
your job and that was the sort of uh

287
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,180
Genesis for you you know yeah full-time

288
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,620
right I'm just going to do this so so

289
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,300
that at that point I'm guessing it was

290
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,060
before prop firms and uh you know oh

291
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,640
yeah

292
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,779
forever but I mean like before the

293
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,839
prevalence of them uh so you had to

294
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,060
deposit your own money and try and make

295
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,140
it work what I mean what kind of can you

296
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,360
sort of given us a typical week back

297
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,279
then like how many hours at the charts

298
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,899
how many trades are you taking

299
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,040
six hours a day at least six eight hours

300
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,760
a day I would literally be glued

301
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,100
to my computer yeah and when I say six

302
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,820
hours a day I say six hours a day

303
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,140
because my boyfriend was literally

304
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,660
ripping me away from the computer I

305
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,420
became obsessed especially because after

306
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,100
I got fired from my old job and it

307
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,779
happened because of trading because I

308
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,360
was uh not drinking the results that I

309
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,940
was anymore because I started to look

310
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,279
into trading it felt more interesting to

311
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,800
me and instead of being at the job doing

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,779
what I was supposed to do at the job I

313
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,579
was looking at charts all day

314
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,620
and um yeah eventually that got me fired

315
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,060
but it was you know

316
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,279
it was a good a good thing that happened

317
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,620
now looking back it's a good thing it's

318
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,720
the best one that happened yeah exactly

319
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,060
well I mean yeah so six hours a day and

320
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,279
how many trades would you place in that

321
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,600
six hour period when you were doing

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,160
things you know when that month that it

323
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
worked well versus the month that things

324
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,860
started to go pear-shaped

325
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,880
I started to have bad results again when

326
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,760
I started to look at many pairs the

327
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,060
number of Trades increased because I

328
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,579
would look at more pairs previously I

329
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,680
would only look at Euro USD and GBP USD

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,079
which is what all ICT students have

331
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,579
started with because that's what he was

332
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,160
trading at the time uh and I did good

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,260
while I was focusing only on one two

334
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,399
pairs

335
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,380
um but then when I said yeah you know

336
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,660
what why not apply this because it works

337
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,839
why not just you know scale and apply it

338
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,880
on many pairs and that's where the focus

339
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,860
starts to

340
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,579
shatter because now I was without

341
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,120
actually realizing I was uh chasing

342
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
quantity instead of quality

343
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,579
and uh the number of Trades started to

344
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,579
increase of course because I was not

345
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,980
focused anymore on doing a proper

346
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,560
analysis anything was everything was

347
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,720
happening quite fast okay well I think

348
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,100
this is going to do this so let's buy

349
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,839
okay and this is going to do that let's

350
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,200
sell sometimes I would even put like

351
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
let's say I would take a Buy on GBP USD

352
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,680
and then on GBP JPY on GBP AUD also

353
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,120
because I thought well you know what

354
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,339
they are just correlated so let's just

355
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,820
over trade over risk not make a proper

356
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,260
analysis and uh I started having

357
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,980
good results with about maybe two three

358
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,399
setups a day on two pairs Euro USD and

359
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,920
GBP USD when one had something and the

360
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,300
other one didn't I would trade the one

361
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,760
that had didn't trade both at the same

362
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,100
time but then when I started to you know

363
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,959
in my head scale up

364
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,899
for the good but actually not uh I

365
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,639
reached about

366
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,740
10 20 30 trades a day it was awful

367
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,519

under the video or in the card above

378
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
and so so with with these like I mean

379
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
when you had this strategy that was

380
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,120
working and I suppose even where you

381
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,279
evolved to and what you're doing now

382
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,680
what was sort of like maybe two or three

383
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,199
of the key components that factor into

384
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,260
that from the ICT arsenal of you know

385
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,240
12-month mentorship kind of kind of

386
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,339
thing what were the the three things you

387
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,680
found that like the most powerful

388
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,139
to put into a strategy from the from the

389
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,180
mentorship I don't think that I got to

390
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,980
consume

391
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,660
um as much as I needed from the paid

392
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,660
mentorship uh to be able to extract

393
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,060
something from it because like I said

394
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,060
I've only been in it not personally but

395
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,519
I've only watched it like the first four

396
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,800
months uh order blocks have always

397
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,860
attracted me but I then realized

398
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,260
afterwards that uh when I started you

399
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,940
know filtering the information out I

400
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,760
realized that I was I thought that I was

401
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,519
attracted to order blocks simply because

402
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,139
everywhere you would look for how to

403
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,420
trade you would find order blocks so it

404
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,980
was like something fashionable yeah

405
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,959
let's get into it because everyone jumps

406
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,600
into this bandwagon

407
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,860
um but um I actually found and my entire

408
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,740
trading strategy is based on

409
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,620
his free content

410
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,480
and that was the frequency before the

411
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
before the premium yeah yeah yeah yeah

412
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,380
yeah yeah

413
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,139
it was it was yeah

414
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,060
I find that people do have have managed

415
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,160
to get a lot out of those free videos

416
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,959
that uh that he put out like you know

417
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,720
not that many but enough to do some

418
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,100
damage yes it yeah it's a it's a hard

419
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,459
path to follow when you want to you know

420
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,500
just study his uh YouTube content

421
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,360
because it's you don't know what to

422
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,599
start with uh there there's not a an

423
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,699
actual structure this is phase one phase

424
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,500
two phase three you need to start with

425
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,299
this and first learn the basics and then

426
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,339
uh you know learn more about those

427
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,919
things and then start to apply them make

428
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,579
yourselves uh a trading plan uh YouTube

429
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,640
doesn't have that and you're uh let's

430
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,419
say enticed into using or consuming

431
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,280
everything randomly yeah so that

432
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,000
delays the a proper understanding but it

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,860
was one video that actually clicked for

434
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,039
me from his YouTube only one do you

435
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,360
remember do you remember which one that

436
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,120
was what was it about I've seen it at

437
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,559
least 30 times the videos title is uh

438
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,440
liquidity purging revert right okay okay

439
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,480
yeah and is that when things started to

440
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,640
to click for you after that sort of down

441
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,840
period yes

442
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,240
exactly after that video I said oh

443
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,360
okay this is what I need to do

444
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,900
this is and from that moment

445
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,020
I don't know it just it's different did

446
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,640
you then bet did you then back test that

447
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,820
and sort of changes okay I didn't I

448
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,440
started back testing but I've actually

449
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,360
started to

450
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,460
um uh

451
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,980
more like go back in the charts not do

452
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,620
actual back testing but to go back in

453
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,020
the chart and see my understanding from

454
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,720
the video would apply yeah and I just

455
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,520
couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that

456
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,860
so then I said I spent about I think two

457
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,299
months till uh trying to figure out uh a

458
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,520
rule-based strategy because I I needed

459
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280
rules I needed step-by-step plan and my

460
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,600
mind is

461
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,700
um constructed in such a way that I

462
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
always need a step-by-step plan anything

463
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,020
I do I need to know this is the first

464
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,640
thing that I need to do this is the fact

465
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,740
the second this is the third and if I

466
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,660
don't have the second then I'm still at

467
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,380
stage one I don't I cannot go directly

468
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,320
to step three that's what I've actually

469
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
spent time in figuring out how to do it

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
at first I was using some indicators

471
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,220
um

472
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,220
uh and then I ditched them as I started

473
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,960
to understand more price action and

474
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,820
focusing more on price action the

475
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,039
indicators you know disappeared from my

476
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,260
charts and now I just trade with uh

477
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,000
rectangles

478
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
lines

479
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,299
not trend lines

480
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,580
uh and the bear chart and that's it I

481
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,039
only focus on what happens right now in

482
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,120
front of me

483
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,460
and how many steps in your step-by-step

484
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,919
plan

485
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,640
uh

486
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,520
if I were to count the parts that takes

487
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,679
less than 30 seconds to identify what is

488
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,620
the actual the overall Market bias

489
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,299
whether we're bullish or bearish if I

490
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,000
were to include that one also so I'd

491
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
have the bias I'd have the point of

492
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,919
interest on the word time frame uh and

493
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,840
then for the actual entry setup

494
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
candidate

495
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,980
imbalance

496
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,160
uh three steps only three okay three

497
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,740
steps three steps is like a two

498
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,380
Candlestick uh model let's say yeah but

499
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,840
yes just that okay cool word so yeah

500
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
three is easy to remember I think it was

501
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,360
I was picturing 30. so no

502
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,780
um yeah it was five previously but then

503
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,020
you know understanding the markets has

504
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,660
levels

505
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,299
so when you understand another level you

506
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,940
just simplify it even more okay and what

507
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,980
when you say it has levels what do you

508
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,360
mean by that

509
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,580
I mean that

510
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,679
um my strategy was not perfect

511
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,080
three months ago but now I feel like it

512
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,860
is

513
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,260
uh and um

514
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,360
even though I've used my strategy for

515
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,340
like the past two years two years and a

516
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,340
half in the form in which it was two

517
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,200
three months ago

518
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,440
um it was not perfect and I've felt like

519
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
it needed some improvement

520
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,539
in regards to the risk reward ratio

521
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,460
because sometimes my stop loss was a bit

522
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,080
bigger uh than my actual first DP but

523
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,039
then

524
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,440
I've found a way to improve it after

525
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,000
I've

526
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,460
you know leveled up another layer of

527
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,679
understanding so it's it's levels to

528
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,480
understanding the markets you think you

529
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
understand something but then you

530
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,679
understand it even more and you have

531
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,780
another aha moment to your previously

532
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,280
aha moment

533
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,039
and uh and so how did that turn around

534
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,679
feel for you and what was sort of like

535
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,000
the The Experience can you explain that

536
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,080
uh that that made me go from the um

537
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,620
imperfect sort of yeah so basically we

538
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,960
transition from you know like losing

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,760
Trader to profitable Trader how did that

540
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,740
transition happen was it like a

541
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,659
instantaneous thing where you just you

542
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,400
know all of a suddenly you started you

543
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,140
know winning trades after trade and and

544
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,640
they're growing the account consistently

545
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,780
or was it you mean you mean back then

546
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,419
back then yeah back then

547
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,320
um no it was just a I I didn't notice

548
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,200
that I started to make actual profit I

549
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,940
was focusing not on making profits

550
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,740
anymore when I started focusing on the

551
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,140
process itself of me being disciplined

552
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,419
of me following a set of rules even

553
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,400
though the set of rules was was still

554
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,960
being built

555
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,520
um even though

556
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,480
um I I still didn't control my emotions

557
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,600
I didn't master myself I still don't

558
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,220
master myself the way that I would want

559
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,780
to master myself but

560
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,880
you know it's a continuous learning

561
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,260
process

562
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,840
um but it was actually a

563
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,320
a process oriented thing I was focusing

564
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,020
on what happens in the chart didn't care

565
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,120
about the Pips didn't care about the

566
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,700
money if I made money

567
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,799
um because then we you know

568
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,260
we were a little better financially

569
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,120
speaking so I didn't felt that pressure

570
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,640
anymore oh we need to make money I need

571
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,220
to make money because I'm at a job and I

572
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,080
need to bring money somehow into the

573
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,960
household uh things started to go a bit

574
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,720
better for us and uh that pressure

575
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,940
disappeared and uh

576
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,020
I I was again able to focus on the

577
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,020
process on me waiting for something

578
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,000
specific to happen

579
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,620
and then I

580
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,500
I just didn't care about the profit that

581
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,080
I made at the end of the week when I

582
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,480
looked at how much profit I made I said

583
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,120
oh I mean two percent that's good it's

584
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,400
good and two percent was nothing at that

585
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,659
time because my account balance was

586
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:46,620
small

587
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,120
and so if you had to like sort of break

588
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,980
down and you know you said you're doing

589
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
six hours at the charts and you know

590
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,880
you're trading multiple Pairs and that

591
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,360
sort of fell down uh what were you doing

592
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,539
when you were like two percent for the

593
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,940
week great what was it what was it what

594
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,220
was the change in time of the charts and

595
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,400
or markets trading a number of Trades

596
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
uh focusing only on Euro USD uh only

597
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
your USD because my my major losses

598
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,140
happened always on GBP USD even when I

599
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,679
was trading only those two pairs uh then

600
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,020
when I started to trade everything it

601
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,600
was a total catastrophe and then I

602
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
restarted focusing again only on Euro

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,520
USD so when I did that

604
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,039
um you know my focus became very sharp

605
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,120
only at one thing and um a normal

606
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,980
trading day would look like I would wake

607
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,280
up uh wait for about two hours after I

608
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,020
wake up for the London fuel Zone to

609
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,720
start uh I'm sure that the listeners

610
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
know what a Killzone is I think they

611
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,020
will nail because I think that the one

612
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,820
I'm releasing in a couple of hours is

613
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,919
all about the Cool Zone yeah the kill

614
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,100
zones yeah okay so um uh wait for the

615
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
Killzone to start and then just focus

616
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,880
two three hours from the London Kill

617
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Zone and then if I have time

618
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,559
two three hours again on the New York

619
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,260
Kill Zone but not necessarily placing

620
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,020
trades because previously this is this

621
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,000
was what I was doing I felt like if the

622
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
market moved 12 Pips

623
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,179
to the downside I I I I I needed to be

624
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,200
in that

625
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,500
a move you know uh and then if there's a

626
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,659
pullback of eight eight Pips I need to

627
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,580
benefit from that so that's

628
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,640
how my mentality was previous to that

629
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,480
but now I wanted to focus only on having

630
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,480
one setup if I can have one good trade

631
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,020
in a session I don't need more and

632
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,640
that's actually the thing that changed

633
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,340
so focusing on only one pair back to one

634
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,740
pair and

635
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,039
two three hours per session but wait for

636
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,620
one single setup don't feel like if

637
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,260
markets it's dropping you need to be in

638
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,380
that trade no okay it's dropping I'll

639
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,880
wait for a pullback and then you know or

640
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I'll wait for a reversal yeah and so so

641
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,419
uh if you look at your stats now

642
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,340
um say for example the past month I mean

643
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,799
what would you

644
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,320
how's your win rate look and if you see

645
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,179
it risk to reward per trade how does

646
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,480
that look what are those two for the

647
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,340
best month my win rate someone was

648
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,400
asking me yesterday on Instagram for the

649
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,520
past month my win rate has been 93 I

650
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,640
didn't have that much traits

651
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,460
um only trading one single pair now I've

652
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,679
transitioned to trading all the gold and

653
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,380
I've been doing this for one year one

654
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,940
year and a half

655
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,980
been trading mode for quite some time

656
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,840
yeah

657
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,760
um and

658
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,760
not too many trades usually one maybe

659
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,860
two trades a day if I trade both

660
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,320
sessions London and New York usually I

661
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,020
don't trade both sessions because if I

662
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,620
if I take a setup on London I feel like

663
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,659
I've

664
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,279
I don't need to be in front of charts

665
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,679
anymore I want to enjoy more the other

666
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,380
things that become available to us you

667
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,640
know yeah

668
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,080
um when you start to know what you're

669
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,140
doing in the charts and

670
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,799
risk reward previously when my strategy

671
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,260
was imperfect it was

672
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,820
um I would risk more than I would

673
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,520
actually aim to take profit so my risk

674
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,100
reward was negative but my win rate was

675
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,340
also good however right now I don't aim

676
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,200
for something less than one to one if I

677
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,820
have one to one doesn't matter if it's

678
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,380
going to be 10 tips doesn't matter if

679
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,679
it's going to be 15 or 20 or 30 if it's

680
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,600
30 Pips for example

681
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,299
um dirty bib stop loss I would aim for a

682
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,020
30 bips TP but I've made like a golden

683
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,779
rule for myself and this has been the

684
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,000
best decision that I've ever taken I

685
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,440
think is to take most of my position off

686
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,159
at 20 Pips so I still do that yeah yeah

687
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,520
so even though my stop loss is 30 my TP

688
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,980
is going to be 30 at least 30. I don't

689
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,380
use TP usually I just might manually

690
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,140
close partial but I would still take

691
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,740
most of my um trade off at 20 Pips okay

692
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,940
so it's like something that I've been

693
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,100
doing yeah any you like moving a stop at

694
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,500
that point or I believe the stop loss at

695
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
break-even yeah I move the stop loss to

696
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,919
break even after that and then if it

697
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,600
takes me out I don't care because I made

698
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,580
money if it doesn't take me out and it

699
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,440
continues to go higher I'm not going to

700
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,419
feel mad previously I would feel mad oh

701
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,340
my God so stupid why did I close the

702
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,600
trade because I could have made so much

703
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,360
more money but now I just realized that

704
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,880
I don't have to do that because when you

705
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,740
find consistency you're going to make

706
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,179
money from

707
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,120
um you know trading more uh you know

708
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,740
more of your trades are going to be

709
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,720
quality trades so it doesn't matter

710
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,200
because now I don't feel like oh

711
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,960
um I took three losing trades so I need

712
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,240
to catch one big trade to recover

713
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,100
everything and being a profit and I

714
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,140
don't feel like that anymore

715
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,659
so now I don't care if the runner goes

716
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,419
200 Pips and in Gold it can happen right

717
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,600
because I've already made my my share

718
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,799
like you're where you're going to get

734
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,559
out of your Runner

735
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,059
uh I look at money I look at money as in

736
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,880
usually I leave a 10 Runner so if that

737
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,399
10 is going to make I don't know 200

738
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,559
let's say or a hundred dollars I would

739
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,080
take something off at Double to a 40

740
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,059
bips so TP

741
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,000
um one in case my risk reward ratio it's

742
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,799
bigger than 20 Pips

743
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,539
um I'm gonna take something at 20 Pips

744
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,580
then I'm gonna take something at tp1

745
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,000
let's say uh uh the normal the the equal

746
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,980
size of the stop loss I'm going to take

747
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,220
half of the runner off and then 40 Pips

748
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,440
60 Pips and

749
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,020
um this I have this approach when um

750
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,720
higher above price if I'm in a bullish

751
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,520
position or in a bearish one lower below

752
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,919
price if I don't have like important

753
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,440
Market structures like uh Killzone highs

754
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,020
and lows I like session highs and lows

755
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,840
um daily highs and lows weekly highs and

756
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,520
lows if I have something like this and

757
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,980
price already reached there I'm going to

758
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,559
close most of the runner and I usually

759
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,659
leave a zero zero one

760
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,080
which just needs to feed my ego yeah

761
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
that's it it's just like leave it alone

762
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,460
it's like a symbolic yeah

763
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,980
yeah it's a symbolic thing that's a good

764
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,080
idea actually yeah that's a good idea

765
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,360
zero zero one how do you I suppose are

766
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,580
you using metatrader for you I'm using

767
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,020
that a Trader yeah so I suppose you can

768
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,260
just close everything bar 0.001 so

769
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,100
whatever yeah

770
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,299
um oh that's interesting yeah and it's

771
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,980
probably a little good tip there I think

772
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,020
people should take away from this is I

773
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,340
think it's something that I always

774
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,760
recommend how did you come up with that

775
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,080
every time I so so this Golden Rule of

776
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,440
um taking uh uh of closing my position

777
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,659
at 20 Pips most of it I've actually got

778
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,760
it from ICT because uh back in the days

779
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,740
when he was trading Euro USD he wouldn't

780
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,799
leave his entire trade to go for more

781
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,779
than 10 11 Pips and he would always say

782
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,700
you don't need more than 10 bips per

783
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,279
trade to make a living out of trading

784
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,039
and then when I started uh looking into

785
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,559
gold gold is a lot more volatile so I

786
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,419
felt like it's natural to have like a

787
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:01,559
double uh you know golden number 10 Pips

788
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,899
for Euro USD or four experience 20 Pips

789
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,000
for gold felt like natural for me but

790
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,919
then when I closed my entire position at

791
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,059
20 Pips

792
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,640
um I felt like and it would continue to

793
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,039
go in my favor

794
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,299
um I I always felt like

795
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,919
and little by little when you start to

796
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,080
pay attention at this these things that

797
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,620
you feel you want to look for uh you

798
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,140
know a way to resolve them uh it's it's

799
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,080
not a good way to uh you know make

800
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,940
yourself not feel those things anymore

801
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,159
it's a good way to feel them but it's a

802
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,659
good way to address them in a way that

803
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,779
you can satisfy that need that you have

804
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,520
for you know I want to be in the trade

805
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,740
for more Pips yeah uh so I then um

806
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,860
realized that in every Trader's head

807
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,140
there are two personalities that leave

808
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,659
and one of them is the trader who is

809
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,059
actually interested in paying his bills

810
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,919
making money and all of that stuff and

811
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,020
becoming consistent with trading so it's

812
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,720
all about the money for this guy and for

813
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,360
the other personality that's technical

814
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,100
analyst who doesn't really care about

815
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,919
the money uh it's the I.T guy if you

816
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,539
want you know the geek that spends a lot

817
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,980
of time in front of the computer and he

818
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,380
makes an analysis and he wants to ride

819
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,720
the entire move or at least as much as

820
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,779
possible from it so I couldn't get rid

821
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,179
of that personality from my own hand so

822
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,279
I said okay I need to make peace with

823
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,519
this girl girl you know inside my head

824
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,220
and that's how I came up with the with

825
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,820
this thing you know take money so the

826
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,620
trader in me is the one that I will

827
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,559
always prioritize because she helps me

828
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,279
to pay my bills she helps me to fund my

829
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,820
lifestyle and all that and I also need

830
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,500
to

831
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,659
um the other girl you know the technical

832
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,419
analyst in me I need to keep her

833
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,279
satisfied because otherwise she's going

834
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,380
to start sabotaging me she will not

835
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,140
allow me to take my money put it in my

836
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,840
pocket and she'll just say you know just

837
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,720
put a break even and if price goes 20

838
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,639
Pips in my favor and I don't take profit

839
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,500
and it takes me out a break even I'm

840
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,179
gonna feel

841
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,359
um more pain you know mentally than I

842
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,339
would if I just take most of the

843
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,080
position off at 20 Pips at least I paid

844
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,418
myself and then just leave something to

845
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,000
satisfy the technical analyst yeah this

846
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,739
is brilliant it's absolutely real I've

847
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,179
never heard anything like this and like

848
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,918
300 odd episodes have done yes so this

849
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,599
is fantastic it's interesting because I

850
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,520
I challenge you out there to anyone

851
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,280
who's listening uh how many of you

852
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,359
thought that she was gonna say that the

853
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,000
second person the technical analyst was

854
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,239
the one that you wanted to be I I

855
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,619
thought that for a second there I was

856
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,719
like are you gonna say that that's the

857
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,918
one that sounds like the right one

858
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,780
doesn't it not the one that's going to

859
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,660
just take the money and run but yeah

860
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,000
that's that's a that's a complete and

861
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,380
utter

862
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,900
um mindset shift that I think you know

863
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,420
it's great for people to hear that uh

864
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,700
fantastic stuff now um

865
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,220
what about like prop firms they sort of

866
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,320
came on the scene whilst you were you

867
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,300
know doing well by the sounds of it I

868
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,980
mean have you ever considered it did you

869
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,900
ever sort of think this was something I

870
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,020
need to look into or you know trade in a

871
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,260
on a firm no not at all okay no I never

872
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,900
and and what was the reason for that was

873
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,940
there something in that you sort of

874
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,500
decided like nah I'm not going to do it

875
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,720
because of XYZ or was it

876
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,900
[Music]

877
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,400
uh it's something that I decided I'm not

878
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,040
gonna do because

879
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,640
um back in my job when I used to work

880
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,920
um we had a lot of trainings about time

881
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,599
management and about how to make the

882
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,220
people be more productive and all of

883
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,339
that state all of that stuff and uh

884
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,560
something from one of those trainings uh

885
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,200
actually uh helped me a lot in my

886
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,220
trading uh and that was whenever you

887
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,520
have a time limit set by someone else to

888
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,660
accomplish a Target you will always

889
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,839
stumble uh you will always not be there

890
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,300
in time uh

891
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,660
and the main thing that prop firms do

892
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,920
they give you a time limit by which you

893
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,079
need to make a certain amount so it's

894
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,200
basically you are being imposed some

895
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
rules the purpose of trading the purpose

896
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,740
of me becoming successful is to not have

897
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,839
anyone else impose me their own rules

898
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,380
and I know that for a lot of people uh

899
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,400
prop firms have been a blessing uh it it

900
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,000
just I couldn't find a good reason for

901
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,480
me to start looking into a proverb you

902
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,160
know starting with a big Capital because

903
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,339
I thought well I deposited 500 and I

904
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,500
blew the account what on Earth makes me

905
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,140
think that I can pay a prop firm a

906
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,240
thousand dollars to give me a hundred

907
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
thousand dollar account what makes me

908
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,700
think that I'm gonna do better with them

909
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,800
okay if it's my own money and I can

910
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,500
afford to lose it and it's the less it's

911
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,260
500 and I can't do good with it what

912
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,960
makes me think that I can actually you

913
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,579
know take care of someone else's money

914
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,079
and even though at the beginning with

915
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,420
prop forms you start with a demo account

916
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,240
you still pay the challenge yeah you

917
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,339
know so I thought instead of paying for

918
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,200
the challenge let me start my own

919
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,280
account

920
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,680
start being consistent and then I'll see

921
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,220
if I need a a bigger fund you know more

922
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,560
money and then I will see but at least

923
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,079
let me get consistent with my own

924
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,200
trading method yeah and uh little by

925
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,720
little I just didn't need it yeah

926
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,480
because I started doing good yeah it

927
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,180
makes sense yeah but the rule-based or

928
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,700
the imposed rules and I know now there

929
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,920
are preference because that's a very bad

930
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,440
rule that they have it's very

931
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,780
um traumatizing I would say for a Trader

932
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,380
yeah the these guys here I'll tell you

933
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,020
what though they've just released an uh

934
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,240
an unlimited so this is blue Guardian I

935
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,220
know unlimited time yeah so they've yeah

936
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,760
I think I know yeah I know they have

937
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,220
this because now you know when they're

938
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,560
the first prop first that started to pop

939
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,859
up you know uh like ftmo or mff maybe I

940
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,480
don't know if mff now has like an

941
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,859
unlimited time period to pass the

942
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,079
challenge but whatever but at first all

943
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,180
the platforms that appeared

944
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,940
um they'd have this 30 days to pass the

945
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,880
challenge now when they're like other uh

946
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,859
prop fronts that are emerging they know

947
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,339
how to do better because it's pretty

948
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,820
obvious that that imposed 30 days to

949
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,839
make 10 or 8 or 12 12

950
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:54,380
people will rush things they will not

951
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,839
see that okay I have one month I have 30

952
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,060
days to pass the challenge if they take

953
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,800
one or two losses or maybe even three

954
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,320
losses in a row there they will feel the

955
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,180
urge to recover that fast because they

956
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,859
will feel like they are running out of

957
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,680
time so now prop firms that start to

958
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,520
emerge now or that appeared after ftmo

959
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,740
because you know fdmo and everyone's

960
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,520
head is like the first proper you know

961
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,800
um now they start to do better with uh

962
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,099
less rules less strict rules and all of

963
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,260
that so this is good but now I don't

964
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,380
have any reason to go for a profit but

965
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,740
it's good that they they start to uh you

966
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,079
know have

967
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,180
more uh to be more Trader oriented

968
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,859
because if you're oriented towards the

969
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,440
trader that's going to trade your funds

970
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,940
um then you're also oriented towards

971
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,160
yourself you know yeah yeah and like I

972
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,320
mean you invest in the trader make him

973
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,740
feel safe make him feel not rushed and

974
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,079
uh she's gonna do a lot better yeah than

975
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,700
if you rush him yeah you need to do this

976
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,980
in 30 days otherwise you're out yeah

977
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,800
yeah which and I I suppose it does like

978
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,980
really you know get rid of the traders

979
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,359
that can trade because they are going to

980
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,099
you know blow the account at 30 days and

981
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,619
the ones that are very exceptional like

982
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,680
you know for yourself for example I

983
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
don't even you know they're not you're

984
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
not enticed by the the proper model

985
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,960
because you don't need it

986
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,720
um so it's it's a it's a fine line uh

987
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,300
right let's move on it is yeah so so uh

988
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,560
what do you think made you different

989
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,380
from other you know folks following like

990
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,260
you on Instagram or or people you've

991
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,760
like either I don't know if you Mentor

992
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,960
people but like if you're mentored

993
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,280
people what do you think made you

994
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,740
different at the start yeah

995
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,720
I think it's the same thing that makes

996
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,320
me different at the moment which is

997
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,339
my availability to help everyone

998
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:49,980
regardless if they are part of my paid

999
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,980
mentorship or not I've always

1000
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,800
spent a lot of time in answering all the

1001
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,599
questions that I've received and not

1002
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,480
just give like a blunt answer yes or no

1003
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,760
or yeah you need to go check that or you

1004
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,099
need to go look at that uh no I've

1005
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,980
always spent a lot of time every day to

1006
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,540
answer questions

1007
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,520
in the same way in which I would have

1008
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
wanted someone to answer me so I think

1009
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,359
that the fact that I've always been

1010
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,119
helpful friendly

1011
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,000
um you know answering questions even

1012
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,740
when they were about my paid mentorship

1013
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,020
like if someone asked me a question that

1014
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,820
would be something that I would only

1015
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,320
teach in the paid mentorship or

1016
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
something like that I wouldn't say oh

1017
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,440
you know well I covered that only in the

1018
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,359
paid mentorship no I just give him what

1019
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,359
he asked for me from me and I think that

1020
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,859
this little by little started to add up

1021
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:44,280
more people were coming to me asking me

1022
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,680
stuff I kept replying I kept being

1023
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,300
friendly and I still do that I have I do

1024
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,940
not have a single comment

1025
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,220
in my entire YouTube channel that has

1026
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,960
remained unanswered not till this date

1027
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,760
and it's a thing that I do three times a

1028
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,760
day I go to YouTube studio and I go to

1029
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,560
my Instagram and I go to my Telegram and

1030
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,780
every day three times a day I make sure

1031
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,520
okay what new comments do I have when

1032
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,200
your questions that I receive I need to

1033
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,940
answer them all I cannot leave people

1034
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,859
like that without answering them without

1035
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,859
making them feel like I pay attention to

1036
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:20,160
them so I think that this is what

1037
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,500
um you know made me be different and it

1038
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,440
still is something that

1039
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,140
um makes me be a bit different from the

1040
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,579
others yeah you're making me feel like a

1041
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,560
bad YouTuber I I was really struggling

1042
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,720
to talk it to the comments no because

1043
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,400
I'm sure the comments that you receive

1044
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,960
are not necessarily questions about

1045
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,820
technical analysis and all that stuff

1046
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,000
that's me yeah so what I was really

1047
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
after was like from from a trading point

1048
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,839
of view versus a mentorship and I think

1049
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,000
I probably screwed up the question there

1050
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,119
um yeah what do you think made you

1051
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,760
different as a Trader like you know why

1052
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,500
did why were you able to sort of come

1053
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,140
through it and become a profitable

1054
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,119
Trader whereas so many come through and

1055
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,280
fail or give up or or just spend years

1056
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,680
and can never really make it happen

1057
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,319
okay it's um

1058
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,319
my

1059
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,960
my needs to simplify things I don't like

1060
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,900
complicated things I don't like uh

1061
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,000
complicated designs complicated clothes

1062
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,520
complicated jewelry complicated makeup I

1063
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,980
don't like any of that stuff uh and this

1064
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,319
also transposed into trading when I

1065
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,240
first started to learn ICT everything

1066
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,619
was complex I at that time I would say

1067
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,359
it's complicated now I know it's only

1068
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,359
complex not complicated anymore

1069
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,400
um but um

1070
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,920
trying to do good in a very complex

1071
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,920
environment with very complex methods

1072
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,319
it's going to make you

1073
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,260
be successful a lot harder and a lot

1074
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,140
later so I think that when I realized

1075
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,619
that I need to simplify things I need to

1076
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,980
exclude more than 90 of the things that

1077
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,540
I've understood that I've learned about

1078
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,420
and I need to understand that if I'm in

1079
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,579
a candy store and I will want to eat all

1080
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,619
the candies I'll get cavities very soon

1081
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,619
so it's not in my benefit so I then

1082
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,680
spent some time realizing only just

1083
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,180
staring at charts and trying to

1084
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,900
understand myself what is that thing in

1085
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,940
the charts that makes me look at it

1086
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,880
right at the first moment when I open

1087
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,460
the charts and for me those were highs

1088
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,700
and lows and big candles and balances so

1089
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,859
then I said okay if this is these are

1090
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,400
the two things that I feel like my eyes

1091
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,520
and my bracer instantly attracted to I

1092
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,400
have two brains my eyes and my brains my

1093
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,020
eyes and my brain are instantly

1094
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,940
attracted to

1095
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,540
um I said okay maybe it's time to

1096
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,060
learn more about these things focus more

1097
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,240
on these and then if I feel like I need

1098
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,400
to add something I will look into a

1099
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,020
third concept or something like that but

1100
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,260
I think my need to simplify things and

1101
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,480
to have everything simple around me is

1102
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,119
what made me simplify ICP Concepts

1103
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,060
explain them in a simple way not you

1104
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,579
know put a lot of lipstick on the charts

1105
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:15,060
like ICT says himself and uh just keep

1106
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,700
it simple this this is yeah so

1107
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,740
simplistic so keep simplifying things

1108
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,140
down which is which in a way is kind of

1109
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,900
hard for like it's hard it's hard for

1110
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,339
everything right I mean Apple do it very

1111
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:27,839
well in terms of they simplified all

1112
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,420
their products down and but it I don't

1113
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,099
even remember a speech from an Apple

1114
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,079
employee who was saying it is actually

1115
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,160
one of the hardest things of the world

1116
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,839
to do is to simplify something that's

1117
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,420
quite complex yes exactly so it's a

1118
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,040
special talent there

1119
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,319
um in terms of I mean the other thing

1120
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,180
you did I suppose with the regard to the

1121
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,280
stop loss and take profit and and exits

1122
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,319
is that's kind of simple right it's like

1123
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,480
it's almost old school I've even heard

1124
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,599
people talk about a 30 pip stop loss and

1125
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,480
a 20 pip take profit and Donkey tears

1126
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,760
nobody talks about it now so the fact

1127
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,980
that you know with that you get a 93 win

1128
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,380
rate last month then there's something

1129
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,579
to be said about that because you're

1130
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,980
always making money right and exactly

1131
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,839
that's the game

1132
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,579
um I'm loving this interview by the way

1133
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,980
it's really really good uh right what

1134
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,099
about a mindset sort of technique or

1135
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,200
something you do like on the day to try

1136
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,960
and get you on the in the right right

1137
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,880
frame of mind

1138
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,819
do you have anything oh I see I do I

1139
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,920
think uh it's not necessarily something

1140
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,040
that I do but it's something that that I

1141
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,200
pay attention to I think that starting

1142
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,640
your day

1143
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,040
um in front of charts if you open a

1144
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,140
chart but you know that you didn't get a

1145
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,260
proper rest during the night or you had

1146
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,079
a fight with your partner or there's

1147
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,480
something else you know working in the

1148
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,460
back of your head that you're thinking

1149
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,319
about and you can't really focus if

1150
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,640
there's something that needs to be

1151
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,619
solved right now and it's not trading

1152
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,160
related I try not to engage that much in

1153
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,859
trading I first try to fix that thing

1154
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:03,300
and then

1155
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,520
um you know

1156
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,140
refocus on trading another thing that I

1157
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,359
started doing is

1158
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,079
um I bought a whiteboard and I write on

1159
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,960
it uh thanks

1160
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,240
for all the good trades that I take and

1161
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
for all the batteries that I take and

1162
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,040
for the bad ones when I don't follow my

1163
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,800
rules when I jump ahead of myself and

1164
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,440
all of that stuff I write there thank

1165
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,119
you for the lesson that cost me this

1166
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,540
much and I don't erase those from the

1167
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,420
Whiteboard uh because I want them to be

1168
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,380
like a a statement of what happens when

1169
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,640
I

1170
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,619
don't do what I'm supposed to do but I

1171
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,240
don't do what I teach other to do other

1172
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,400
people to do and that really helps me

1173
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,500
keep myself accountable

1174
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,300
and how many how many though sorry

1175
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,920
what's the oldest one of those that

1176
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,960
you've written on the how long ago was

1177
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,040
it

1178
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,599
uh oldest one is like an entire account

1179
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,720
not a trade I haven't had a like a trade

1180
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,400
that I lost because I didn't follow the

1181
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,319
rules so those are the kind of things I

1182
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,119
saw you I mean um I mean on the

1183
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,260
Whiteboard if you're writing these

1184
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,000
things on the Whiteboard yeah how long

1185
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,220
ago was the last the the first one you

1186
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,540
put on

1187
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,560
first one oh it was uh I think five

1188
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,280
months ago because I didn't

1189
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,160
how many of you go on there now

1190
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,740
yeah

1191
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,040
let me check

1192
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,599
14 but one of them 14 but one of them is

1193
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,819
an entire account right I'll tell you

1194
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,440
the story if you want yeah go for it

1195
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,000
because it's already public you know

1196
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,619
yeah yeah okay so uh four months ago I

1197
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,900
said that you know there are a lot of

1198
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,780
people who want to learn more but they

1199
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,579
don't necessarily

1200
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,040
um have the money to pay for a

1201
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,319
mentorship and for some whatever reason

1202
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,020
even though I'm always available to

1203
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,000
answer questions they don't ask

1204
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,819
so I said okay maybe my YouTube content

1205
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,619
doesn't help I don't even have that much

1206
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,140
time to produce YouTube content so I

1207
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,960
said there has to be a way in which I

1208
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,319
could um make other people benefit from

1209
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:21,420
my trading and I opened a copy effect

1210
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,880
service and that happens about four

1211
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,680
months ago I think maybe three months

1212
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
ago uh it was uh in uh at the beginning

1213
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,300
of

1214
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,359
March or middle of March so I'm going to

1215
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,040
copy FX service I deposited three

1216
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,980
thousand dollars people started to

1217
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,200
um you know copy my trades it went good

1218
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,560
for the first two weeks and then

1219
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,800
I I don't know everything like all my

1220
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,180
mindset was doubt absolutely I started

1221
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,160
to do everything that I did in my

1222
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,720
beginning stages of trading everything

1223
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,420
that I was not supposed to do Buy sell

1224
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,400
Buy sell if I see a good girl a big

1225
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,040
candle just buy at an Impulse sell out

1226
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,200
an Impulse oh my god

1227
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,300
um don't post don't don't put stop bus

1228
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,760
remove the stop loss all of that thing

1229
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,460
and eventually I just blew the account

1230
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,120
it was such

1231
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,819
[Music]

1232
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:16,859
that was because that was the pressure

1233
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,200
the pressure of like having other people

1234
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,839
yes taking those trades a lot of people

1235
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,700
because like I said in the first two

1236
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,319
weeks everything was really good in the

1237
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,940
first two weeks I did

1238
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,240
20 I think or 17 I even had a day in

1239
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,859
which I did seven percent which I was

1240
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,339
wow that's good and then

1241
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:38,040
um people started writing me

1242
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,680
thanking me uh thank you for the

1243
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,579
opportunity I put my rent money and you

1244
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,040
uh made more of it and all of that stuff

1245
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
a guy wrote me

1246
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,300
um because I had like a minimum deposit

1247
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,280
of a hundred dollars you know it was you

1248
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,980
know the requirement from the broker

1249
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,960
um and

1250
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,900
a guy wrote to me and he told me could

1251
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,760
you please lower the minimum deposit

1252
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,559
requirement and make it 50 because I

1253
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,680
only have 50 it's my only money and I

1254
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,079
wanna you know put it there so I copy

1255
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,420
your trades and make it more uh and make

1256
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,300
more of it but I started receiving all

1257
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,640
these messages and I realized that most

1258
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,980
of the people that have

1259
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,800
signed for The Copy Service were people

1260
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,900
that didn't even afford to lose that

1261
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,780
money that they put in and I said I've

1262
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,280
opened

1263
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,980
a Pandora box something that I was not

1264
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,920
supposed to do because people who

1265
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,160
sign up for a copy service they don't

1266
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,500
trade or at least they don't have the

1267
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,700
results that they want so their mindset

1268
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,359
is like well she'll make money for me

1269
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,640
and I'm sure that she will so I'll put

1270
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,500
all the money that I have so they are

1271
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,960
not aware of the fact that they can lose

1272
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,780
that money and when I realized that that

1273
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,000
you know I cannot control the kind of

1274
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,680
people that are going to copy my service

1275
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,700
and when I say the kind of people I say

1276
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,280
aware people people that have the

1277
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,099
awareness that stuff bad stuff can

1278
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,559
happen and the money can be lost

1279
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,200
and I couldn't control that so then I

1280
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,420
started feeling really responsible oh my

1281
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,220
God what if I'm going to lose someone's

1282
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,839
rent money what if I'm going to lose

1283
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,240
someone's entire life savings what am I

1284
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,319
going to do then because I'll feel

1285
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:28,380
responsive and I will be responsible for

1286
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,140
ruining the lives of people how can I go

1287
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,740
about that so I felt at the time you

1288
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,700
know I was already losing it I felt that

1289
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,599
the best thing to do was to trade more

1290
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,420
you know to make more money faster which

1291
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,700
is a rookie mistake

1292
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,079
I just completely

1293
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,780
you know rug to pull myself yeah yeah

1294
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,900
that's what I did what what kind of risk

1295
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,760
were you what kind of risk were you

1296
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,500
putting on that account versus what are

1297
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,000
you what are you put on your like normal

1298
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,280
account what counts on that account I

1299
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,380
was putting like five maybe ten percent

1300
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,559
risk per trade on my normal account I

1301
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,859
use a fixed slot size on my own

1302
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,500
personal account yeah I put a fixed lot

1303
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,460
size

1304
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,920
doesn't matter how big my stop loss is

1305
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,960
going to be but the thing is that with

1306
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,420
when I was doing The Copy Service I was

1307
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,240
still trading the let's say old rbv

1308
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,220
strategy

1309
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,000
um and that incident

1310
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,420
with the copy effects account made me

1311
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,660
realize that there is something that I

1312
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,640
need to fix with my strategy so that was

1313
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,099
because remember I I told you earlier

1314
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:46,559
that my strategy was not perfect but now

1315
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,599
I feel that I don't need to modify

1316
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,480
anything related to it but back then I

1317
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,099
always felt like for the past three

1318
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,200
years I felt like there's something

1319
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,480
missing but yeah it works it makes money

1320
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,339
so you know what and it was a big stop

1321
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,800
loss that I had and it was

1322
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,040
um some entry confirmations that I had

1323
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,559
and the copy effects incident

1324
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,900
gave me no other choice no other

1325
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,599
alternative but to face

1326
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,359
the problem that I felt the strategy had

1327
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,119
and find a way to fix it

1328
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,180
and then I started taking all my

1329
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:21,839
um

1330
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,319
uh Instagram reels because I would post

1331
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:28,020
my trades on Instagram reels I took them

1332
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,359
all one by one and all the pictures that

1333
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,520
I documented I ever documented my trades

1334
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,099
with because I keep for every year for

1335
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:37,920
every month I keep a like a uh you know

1336
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,040
I uh screenshot my screen when I take a

1337
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,980
trade uh and I keep those as a journal

1338
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,260
of my trade and I started looking at all

1339
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,900
of those trades all of them taken within

1340
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,460
the past two years

1341
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,520
and I realized how to improve my

1342
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,980
strategy because I've just filtered out

1343
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,460
the traits that didn't do good but that

1344
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,020
I you know I said oh it's just part of

1345
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,940
the game losing smart again it is part

1346
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,760
of the game but it's only part of the

1347
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,700
game when you when you when you don't

1348
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,380
feel like there is something else that

1349
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,819
needs to be improved if you feel like

1350
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:13,440
there's something else being to be

1351
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,119
improved but you don't work to improve

1352
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,220
it then the loss is not part of the game

1353
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,040
it's the kind of loss that it it it it

1354
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,920
you left the room for an error there and

1355
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,599
you're not doing anything to address it

1356
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,240
if you find the error and you do

1357
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,500
something to address it and you address

1358
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,599
it and you still get a loss and you just

1359
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,480
literally feel like there's nothing else

1360
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,599
that you need to improve or that okay I

1361
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,579
don't know what other things to improve

1362
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,220
honestly if that's the case then yes

1363
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,140
that's a loss that is part of the game

1364
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,420
it is what it is accept it because you

1365
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,559
know no system is 100 bulletproof but if

1366
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,880
you take a loss

1367
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,520
and you treat it as if it's a part of

1368
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,660
the game but deep down you have a doubt

1369
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,000
what if there could have been something

1370
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,980
that I could have done

1371
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,160
to you know improve my entry to improve

1372
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,319
my stop-loss placement to have like a

1373
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:10,440
better uh price level at which I need to

1374
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,180
wait for price to be informed of my

1375
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,520
specific setup when you feel that but

1376
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,440
you just ignore it

1377
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,300
eventually is gonna

1378
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,760
come against you yeah yeah I'll sort of

1379
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,140
I'll sort of get what you say in there

1380
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,000
I'll sort of get what you're saying

1381
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,079
um yeah now what about uh uh we're gonna

1382
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,460
jump into the quick far round in a

1383
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,380
second but before we do I just want to

1384
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,119
see if there's any one thing you would

1385
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,920
recommend a retail Trader spend the next

1386
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,940
month mastering

1387
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,500
themselves

1388
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,559
themselves your

1389
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,619
um

1390
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,800
pay attention to what you feel when you

1391
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,839
open the chart pay attention to the urge

1392
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,940
that you feel of being in a move that is

1393
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,480
happening right now pay attention to

1394
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,720
[Music]

1395
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,720
um

1396
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,480
you know

1397
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,940
if I were to to relate only at a

1398
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,460
technical analyst from a technical

1399
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,460
analyst standpoint I would say focus on

1400
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,680
understanding Market structures if you

1401
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,020
understand Market structures and if you

1402
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,079
can find a way in which to blend price

1403
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:21,420
structures with time structures and

1404
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,400
understand that there has to be a price

1405
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,559
level that it is

1406
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,020
a Time structure and a market structure

1407
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,520
like price structure at the same time

1408
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,020
and that's the one that you should focus

1409
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,300
on then yes spend time on that so

1410
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,040
understanding Market structures and

1411
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,839
understanding

1412
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,280
um

1413
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,440
you know time and price not just price

1414
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,260
from a technical analysis standpoint

1415
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,960
this is what I would focus on

1416
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,220
understanding Market structures from a

1417
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,660
time and price perspective

1418
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,520
psychologically speaking Master yourself

1419
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,160
try to pay attention at all those urges

1420
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,680
that push you you know push the button

1421
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,200
when you know you're not supposed to pay

1422
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,359
attention to how your heart is racing

1423
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,640
when you push the button

1424
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,460
because the heart is racing I mean your

1425
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,960
heart wouldn't be racing when you open a

1426
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,500
trade if you if you have a rule-based

1427
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,819
strategy that you know you followed

1428
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,520
you're gonna feel like okay well I have

1429
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,680
a plan I'm following it so why is my

1430
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,200
heart racing but if the heart races it

1431
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,180
means that you're not taking the

1432
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,460
decision to open a trade based on a rule

1433
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,040
or a set of rules that you've you know

1434
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,200
decided to follow and if that's the case

1435
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,300
you know whoever doesn't have rules

1436
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,119
they're not gonna

1437
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,400
evolve and it's also yeah having the

1438
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,020
rules that you that you've tested so

1439
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,520
you've got confidence in it so that

1440
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,380
absolutely absolutely otherwise you can

1441
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,940
have rules but you've still got you

1442
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,319
don't you still don't know whether or

1443
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,079
not it's going to work or

1444
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,920
right we're going to jump into the quick

1445
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,299
fire around here so

1446
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,040
um a few quick questions so how long did

1447
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,780
it take you to go from newbie to

1448
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,940
consistently profitable

1449
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,920
uh about two years

1450
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,619
what's your favorite favorite entry

1451
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,299
setup

1452
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:06,720
entry setup is price has to be below 12

1453
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,839
minute open for me to buy and it has to

1454
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,480
create an imbalance to the upside and

1455
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,960
then like a ICT sphere value Gap

1456
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,720
um and this uh pattern has to form

1457
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,440
between uh let's say nine not not my

1458
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,339
hour

1459
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:26,339
um 2 a.m till 5 a.m New York time zone

1460
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:29,099
for the London session and then I want

1461
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,500
to sell only prices above the 12

1462
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,500
midnight open uh price and it gives me

1463
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,599
that imbalance to the downside and then

1464
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,940
it comes back rebalances and then starts

1465
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,299
to move down so that's my favorite entry

1466
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:45,059
pattern sell above 12 minute open

1467
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:48,299
buy below 12 minute open

1468
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,460
