00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,019
hello and welcome to this model

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,500
my name is Gene and today we are going

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,700
to go for

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,160
what model would I trade for life if I

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,380
was the only trade one model

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,540
now every successor Trader launches

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,520
their Journey

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,279
to consistency

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,140
usually with the model

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,779
I also started out trading one model

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,580
and then I started to Branch out to

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,460
different models and I'm at a point

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,320
where I have multiple models that I

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,620
utilize for execution in management

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,860
and the fitness models over time you

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,739
start to build experience with them and

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,480
the more insight and the more experience

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,700
the game with them the more you start to

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,520
develop other models and usually it

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
takes just one model for you to find

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,300
breakthrough in trading

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
understanding the in and out of that

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,699
model can give you all the success

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,160
everything you need in trading but now

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,719
the problem is a lot of you guys want to

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,480
Branch out and learn multiple models and

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,700
this one and that one and that one and

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,159
then you complicate it and the problem

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,619
for the most or the majority of you guys

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,960
watching this video right now is that

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,580
you are complicating your journey

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,840
because you're trying to do everything

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,080
at once so what I'm saying is

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
all the different things you're trying

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,400
to pick up at once and learn at once

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,700
drop all of them focus on one which one

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,040
resonates with you which one resonates

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
with your own personality choose that

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,580
one

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,759
get data get back data you can back test

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,860
it or you can forward test the model

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,200
with data and see the performance what's

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
the risk reward what's the average

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Reserve word it Nets you what is the

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,439
average return in that's your weekly

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,479
whatsoever returning entry per month

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
what's the longest winning streak what's

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,140
the longest losing streak you need to

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,020
know that statistics of your model so

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,979
you can learn to trust the model so this

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,439
is my favorite model this is my go to

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,220
model

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,560
and Eva also only trade one model for

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Life what model would that be

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,538
that's this one here the New York

56
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,120
optimal trade entry model

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,379
is what we're going to be discussing

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,400
today

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,260
so welcome to today's video and we're

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,720
going to go into Del Bean to the New

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,459
York optimal trade entry model

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,260
all right before we go into the

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,060
breakdown of what the model is let us

64
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,300
first Define what an OTE which stands

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,099
for ultimate trade entry let's define

66
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,500
what that is so we're gonna go from the

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,540
basics then go to the advanced or

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,860
complicated

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,420
I'm by the end of this video you already

70
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,340
have an insight into what this model is

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,319
all about

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,080
an ultimate trade entry simply is a

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,060
measure of discount or premium of price

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,620
now in every range we have premium we

75
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,200
have discount and we have our

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,879
beam Fellowship which is what we call

77
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,080
equilibrium

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,920
price is always valuated based off of a

79
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,860
range okay price is valid either inside

80
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,959
a range or external turretch and that's

81
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,340
why you have a Fibonacci extension

82
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,680
levels

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,260
at every given moment or every price

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,300
price would either be

85
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,700
overbought or oversold now we're not

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,560
talking about supply and demand we're

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,260
we're trying to measure the value of an

88
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,840
asset relative to its range

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
now

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,260
inside the range

91
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,120
anything above

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
the middle point of a range is what we

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,180
call Premium

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,819
anything below the middle part of the

95
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,159
range what we call Discount now let us

96
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,440
Define What premium is and what discount

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,580
is

98
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,220
premium is the measure of the

99
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,599
expensiveness

100
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,400
of an asset

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
or a commodity

102
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,540
discount is a measure of the cheapness

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,840
of an asset or a commodity if we're

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,780
looking to buy we do not want to buy

105
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
when the price is expensive now I'm

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,120
using layman terms to Define Premium

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,500
versus discount

108
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,299
you wouldn't want to go and buy the

109
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,500
iPhone

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,080
when it is worth two thousand dollars if

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,459
you know next week is going to be worth

112
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,260
a thousand dollars does it make sense

113
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,298
for you to go and buy it now it's a

114
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,738
thousand dollars when you know next is

115
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,478
going to be worth a thousand dollars of

116
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,040
course not because you know

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
by next week you're already losing a

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,580
thousand dollars are you losing half the

119
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,919
net worth the iPhone so you're gonna

120
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,919
have to wait until it is discounted from

121
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,780
its two thousand dollar price which is

122
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,860
expensive to then buy your iPhone

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,199
and that's what the term or that's where

124
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,419
the term discount comes from so discount

125
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,919
essentially if you're looking to be a

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
buyer always want to buy a discount if

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,460
you're looking to be a seller you always

128
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,040
want to sell a premium

129
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,220
now if we are buying we are aiming for

130
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,100
the most premium price available to us

131
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,040
on offer and that's always going to come

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,699
in form of the high of a range which is

133
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,800
the most premium price inside that range

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,440
and that's what we call it buys a

135
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,259
liquidable for every buy the market will

136
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,100
look to pair long entries with bicycle

137
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,320
because that is the most premier price

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
inside the training range same way in a

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,300
cell

140
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,960
Marco will look to pair cells at premium

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,900
against cell sound Equitable because

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,180
that is the most discount price inside

143
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,520
the range so this is the basic

144
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,620
understanding of what an ultimate trade
entry is an ultimate trade engine simply
is buying below discount and it builds Auto flow
and aiming for a bicycle equatorial pool
which is those premium price available
to us to exit our bodies or selling
above the mean of a range AKA premium
and aiming for the most discounted price
offered to us are available to us on the
sell side identified as our sell side
liquidatable and this is a big basic
understanding of what ultimate trade
entry is also my trailer entry simply is
buying order flow at discount or premium
and targeted counterparter liquidable

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,620
sounds easy right and here's the key

161
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,800
every successful model

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,199
always finds

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,620
itself thriving in its simplicity

164
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,479
okay and the problem is a lot of you

165
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
guys feel you need to complicate your

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
model for you to make money

167
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,259
you honestly don't and if you access

168
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,539
this model you're gonna see the return

169
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,120
will be literally insane

170
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,819
the accuracy is absolutely insane so I

171
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,020
don't want to do it myself I don't want

172
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,060
you to be a social whereby I'm the one

173
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,560
giving you these stats and seeing Oh

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,840
this is the stats for the model I want

175
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,580
you after you're done watching this

176
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,400
video so either go back test this over a

177
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,199
period of a month and give me your

178
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,120
feedback on Twitter or you can forward

179
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,860
test this over the next two or three

180
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,479
weeks and then give me your feedback on

181
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,699
Twitter and see the performance of the

182
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,759
model itself for your Trading now

183
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,740
obviously if you're going to apply this

184
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,780
model for your trading you need to be

185
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,660
free between a periods of 7am Eastern

186
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,240
titanium Eastern every Monday so

187
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,979
Thursdays because that's the window of

188
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,960
opportunity your trainer model you're

189
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,639
not with this model you're not sitting

190
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,759
in front of your charts every day you

191
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,400
have a very specific time you show up to

192
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
what I call work okay so when you're

193
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,419
showing up to work you're going to work

194
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,800
you couldn't go sit in front of your

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
charts to identify this model if your

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,940
model does not present you're not traded

197
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,400
to model presents you're taking a trick

198
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,160
there's no room for emotions

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
there is no room for excitement when

200
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,660
when you hit take profits there's no

201
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,940
room for sadness when you have a losing

202
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,699
trade our job is to identify our model

203
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,960
and trade if it is present if our risk

204
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,340
is not elevated which we're going to

205
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,220
talk about on video two now let's go

206
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,740
more into the model

207
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,419
let's go into the overview of what this

208
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,979
model is now we already understand that

209
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,380
our model is the New York ultimate trade

210
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,740
entry that's we're looking for but let's

211
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,039
flesh out the model and let's build up

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,500
into what the model looks like with our

213
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,660
model overview now even though we're

214
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,840
Trading day trades or intra session

215
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,580
trades

216
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,780
our sentiment stems from daily autoflow

217
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,659
without the daily autoflow

218
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,599
our model is useless

219
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,958
our model has no value if we don't

220
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,719
understand where the daily candle is

221
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,480
supposed to expand up or down into

222
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,519
so one of you

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
your daily analysis just like the fuel

224
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
or the gas to your car if there is no

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
gas in your car you cannot drive

226
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,800
so the car itself is your model

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
checklist and everything you need to do

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
with your model the gas which is what

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,279
allows the cat to actually function

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,820
is the daily autoflow or the daily

231
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,560
program if you don't have an

232
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,540
understanding of your daily program your

233
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,399
model is useless now why is this the

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
case why is this key because your lower

235
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
time from narrative stem from a daily

236
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,420
autoflow or a daily deliver

237
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,459
everything the lower time frame does is

238
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,860
always going to be in sync with the data

239
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,899
candles if the daily is supposed to

240
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,540
expand higher lower time frame would see

241
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,940
bullish expansion if the date is

242
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,680
supposed to expand lower

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,140
time frame would see the Irish expansion

244
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,120
if the daily spoils are consolidate

245
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,459
that's where I see a lot of back and

246
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,680
forth on the lower time frame and by

247
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,620
understanding the data program and also

248
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,140
the data profile you can select

249
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,019
favorable conditions to employee model

250
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,260
in now this is the condition we're

251
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,839
looking for to execute our model on

252
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,399
before I go into the breakdown of what

253
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,560
you're seeing in front of me we need to

254
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,880
understand what conditions actually suit

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,140
our model

256
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,820
okay and we're only looking to trade

257
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,580
inside these conditions

258
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,160
we are waiting for when the daily candle

259
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,320
or the daily time frame is poised to

260
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,080
expand higher lower into arterial

261
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,540
liquidity and that's where we go in and

262
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,459
we execute on our model

263
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,740
we don't want to go and trade our model

264
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,740
if the daily time frame is in a range or

265
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,200
if it's range bound or if it's shown on

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,620
the willingness to want to displace

267
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,120
what we're looking for is we're looking

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,899
for a data program that is a pause to

269
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,100
this place

270
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,620
to our Target objective on the dated

271
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,060
time frame or B already displacing

272
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,060
to our Target objective on The Daily or

273
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,680
weekly design frame

274
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,779
so usually this is the way the the daily

275
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,519
candle would expand

276
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
so you have the market expanding if it's

277
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,140
a bullish data program the market would

278
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,480
expand from a daily discount it could be

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
a daily Bush auto block or a daily

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,060
bullisher valid or breaker block

281
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,100
the market will start the expansion

282
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,320
higher and the market usually would seek

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,180
a premium Now the same one I just saw

284
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,700
you about discount versus premium you

285
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,920
don't necessarily need to aim for

286
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,740
a swing high on the daily time frame as

287
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,860
your terminals you can aim for a premium

288
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,660
range so you can look for a bear shadow

289
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,000
block or a breaker block or repair Gap

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,519
as a short-term level where the market

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,899
should displays up or down into

292
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,240
the problem with trading is when a lot

293
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,740
of you guys go and you're approach

294
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,660
trading you feel like there's so many

295
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,820
things you need to take into factor to

296
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,519
make money and I'm singing on this video

297
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,019
you don't

298
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,300
there's only two things the markets all

299
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,760
restored Market is always either seeking

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,079
to replace the level of liquidity

301
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
pressing it to repressive level of

302
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,079
inefficiency

303
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,760
everything you see on your chart

304
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,399
everything revolves around the instant

305
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,440
key Concepts both on the daily program

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
or time frame weekly time per monthly

307
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,339
time frame lower time frame it never

308
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,040
goes past this so this information alone

309
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,160
is already empowering because you know

310
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,320
if the market is doing something it's

311
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,720
either going to level of inefficiency or

312
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,940
it's going to level up liquidity those

313
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,060
two so your job on the daily time frames

314
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,000
identify daily conditions which are

315
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,519
poised to expand to an hour time frame

316
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,820
level of inefficient delivery or

317
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,160
counterparty liquidity that's all you're

318
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
looking for

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
once you validate conditions like this

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
you're good to go on your execution

321
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,339
in the process of the daily time from

322
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,560
expanding to our terminal so we're going

323
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,959
to call that premium array Terminals and

324
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,399
that could be in form of a weekly

325
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,399
premium like weekly version block weekly

326
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,980
proportion or weekly high or with the

327
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,779
rejection block or a daily rejection

328
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,700
block okay but it's going to be a daily

329
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,579
or a weekly level as our Terminals and

330
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,019
the process of the market expanding up

331
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,260
into the terminals it will offer

332
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,639
multiple opportunities to get in sync

333
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,839
with the daily buy program via the 4r or

334
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,300
1R discount

335
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
now here's the key

336
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,940
in a daily buy program there are only

337
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,279
two methods of delivering price now

338
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,220
remember I mentioned before

339
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,620
there's only two things a market does in

340
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,639
terms of

341
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,620
reprise into a level of liquidity or

342
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,779
across the level of inefficiency the

343
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,839
market will do so in two ways the market

344
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,700
would either seek counterpart the

345
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,060
liquidity via stops or your Market will

346
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,459
seek to reaccumulate in a buy program

347
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,180
via inefficiencies and Order blocks

348
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,760
that's all the market is doing

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
once you define the program AKA it's a

350
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,540
buy program around your key for or when

351
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,300
our discount array the market will

352
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,240
either retrace in an alternate trade

353
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,500
entry to a farewell Gap AKA inefficiency

354
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,200
or the market will have a run on Cell

355
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,779
stock and then reverse in the version of

356
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,880
daily autoflow

357
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,940
and these this is the only this is the

358
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,820
only model in which the market delivers

359
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,320
liquidity

360
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,579
their inefficiencies or fair value gaps

361
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,320
and you're you're probably seeing like

362
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,940
that does not make sense it's so simple

363
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,160
and that's the problem you've been

364
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,839
taught that for your model to actually

365
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,660
be successful it has to be complicated

366
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,540
which it really does not need to

367
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,399
all he needs to do is it needs to

368
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,980
identify the Baseline in terms of price

369
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,800
delivery and get in sync with that so

370
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,660
again we're looking for daily conditions

371
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,579
our posts will expand in the direction

372
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:51,060
of our Target on liquidity or is already

373
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,620
expanding in the direction of retired

374
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,180
drone liquidity and those are the

375
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,480
conditions that we trade in or

376
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,760
we don't trade at all if the market is

377
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
for a sustain a range or the market

378
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,839
that's just met a night time from a

379
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,180
projective these are the two times

380
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,940
whereby you don't trade when the market

381
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,000
is fringe round or when the market has

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
met and higher time frame objective and

383
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,779
we don't know what's going to happen

384
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,760
next this is where we'll stay aside or

385
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,339
step aside and we do nothing but in the

386
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,860
process of delivering to a daily

387
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,320
terminals the premium array the market

388
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,480
would do so trades are not to form

389
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,740
around

390
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,779
far time frame or one hour time from

391
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,060
discount what you're looking for our

392
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,399
model is identifying

393
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,240
15-minute time from executions inside

394
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
this for our o1r discount array it's

395
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
going to sync with other flow again we

396
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,019
don't necessarily need to aim for the

397
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,639
daily terminals

398
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,860
to take profits all we need to do is we

399
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,959
need to aim for a lower time frame by

400
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,579
solicitable

401
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,800
like I showed you here

402
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,959
and that's a model this is the entire

403
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,540
premise of a model be it buys for a

404
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,180
model or sells with a model

405
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,860
that's the entire premise so we're

406
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,360
looking for expansion and direction of

407
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,160
daily buy program and we're looking for

408
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,320
Bears expansion version of the cell

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
program the only time this model is

410
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,620
going to fill you or

411
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,360
the most types of others are actually

412
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,100
going to fill you is when you get your

413
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,440
daily Direction buyers from or if you

414
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,820
trade during conditions which I'm going

415
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,860
to list on video two which is going to

416
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,019
be another video to this one if you

417
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,120
trade in those conditions that's when

418
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,920
you're more likely to spell

419
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,199
as long as you're deity

420
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,540
program is correct

421
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,000
you are good to go you will find

422
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
consistency with this model you'll make

423
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,959
tons of money with this model

424
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,120
okay so now for

425
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,639
a daily cell program or daily bearish

426
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,620
order flow in which you're aiming for a

427
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,380
daily discount as our terminals we look

428
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,459
for 4r or 1R bearish Revival gaps or buy

429
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,680
Subs to sell firm

430
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,380
so we're selling inside 15 minute time

431
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,639
frame

432
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,480
um

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,919
uh Premium app for r1r biceps or fair

434
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,619
value Gap until the market gets to our

435
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,599
terminals

436
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,040
and this is

437
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,079
it looks so simplistic which is that's

438
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,260
the key right and again somebody has to

439
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,579
go not looking at this and you're like

440
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,000
oh well this is easy yeah it was but now

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,819
the problem is going to be how long can

442
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,679
you see discipline with the model this

443
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,939
is where a lot of you guys actually feel

444
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,100
because people would get models like

445
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,020
this and they'll go mess it up trying to

446
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,000
tweak and add different things right I'm

447
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,280
going to show you how you can go a

448
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,780
little bit more advanced with the model

449
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,640
but going a little bit more advanced

450
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,720
with the model does not necessarily

451
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,480
equate to more profits

452
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
okay the guys were making profits or the

453
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
guys who were doing the repetitive

454
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,460
simplistic things day in day out and

455
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,440
this is the truth with profitable

456
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,059
trading profitable trading is boring

457
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,460
profit option is not exciting

458
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,020
that's where a lot of guys don't really

459
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,940
understand when you're trading

460
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,760
profitably and consistently it is a very

461
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
boring things you're going through

462
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,020
periods of making profits sometimes

463
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,940
you're going through periods of drawdown

464
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,320
sometimes you're going through winning

465
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,299
streaks at the end of the day you

466
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,299
understand that your model has

467
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,179
statistics back in the model and you're

468
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,000
only trading in favor of that stat and

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,980
that's what makes you your money you

470
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,080
know when the odds are high for you to

471
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
go in and leverage or take risk you know

472
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
when the odds are low for you to step

473
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,860
aside and do nothing

474
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,200
and majority of profitable trading

475
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,120
involves stepping aside and doing

476
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,520
nothing that is what perhaps of training

477
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,200
tells or consistent training tools

478
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,940
consistent trading until is doing

479
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,200
nothing

480
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,700
in the periods where you're not doing

481
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,160
anything that's only preserve capital in

482
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,179
prayers where you're doing something

483
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,460
that's when you increase capital and

484
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,559
this is the mindset I want to go in to

485
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,299
with this model when you're going in and

486
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,799
you're doing your back testing and

487
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,900
you're coming back to watch this video I

488
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,360
want you to have this mindset okay for

489
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
you to do this successfully you have to

490
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,780
get comfortable with doing nothing

491
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,340
because there's going to be periods in

492
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,780
time especially when the day time frame

493
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,340
is consolidation there's going to be

494
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,720
tons of perit inside where you're going

495
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,520
to have to do nothing you're going to

496
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,660
have to get comfortable doing nothing

497
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,299
and maybe developing a new model which

498
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,700
you can trade for consolidations which I

499
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,740
I actually have one for but again it's

500
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,380
not this is not what this video is for

501
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,799
okay either you're doing that one or you

502
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,720
do nothing which is the best way to go

503
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,059
about trade you're not rushing anything

504
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,520
you're patient you're waiting for the

505
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,320
conditions to align and then you strike

506
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,660
and then you step aside and repeat the

507
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,900
same thing day in day out week in

508
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,220
weekend and then the difference with

509
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,020
this is that's why this being boring

510
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,720
eventually over a period of time the

511
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,059
action compounds and that's the action

512
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,100
compounds you start to realize oh

513
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,140
actually I have over seven figures worth

514
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,020
in terms of funding and I can make more

515
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,120
money and that's when life starts to get

516
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,679
exciting

517
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,539
but now the problem is no one is ready

518
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,220
to play the long game

519
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,679
obviously prop frames are made it easy

520
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,440
for you to leverage Capital they might

521
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,419
be demo Capital but they've still made

522
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,940
it easily they reduce sums of capital to

523
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,000
then increase your income or gains the

524
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,980
problem is everyone wants to go for a

525
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,440
Max I ever platform at once quickly they

526
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,940
don't want to do it in the process of a

527
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,220
week or two weeks or a month

528
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,200
whereas in reality actually takes a very

529
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
long time to do so you have to

530
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
consistently build and build and be

531
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,500
comfortable building and build it in

532
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,299
Beauty until it gets open whereby all

533
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,220
your actions have all compounded and

534
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,480
you're starting to rip the fear of your

535
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,360
labor and that is what I'm going to

536
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,700
teach you for the next two or three

537
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,140
videos

538
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,240
all right so now it's going to

539
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,820
our set of progression for a model

540
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,039
and what we're looking for is I'm gonna

541
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,260
use a bullish

542
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,500
trend for this example and you can just

543
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,940
reverse

544
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,160
what I'm teaching for the very side so I

545
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,600
don't have to go through for both the

546
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
blue side and the bear side because

547
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,600
they're essentially the same thing

548
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,460
they're both the same thing or just

549
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
after you just have to flip what I'm

550
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,700
saying for the bare side and then it

551
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,780
will make sense

552
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,220
so we're gonna go for our cell

553
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,320
progression for our model before we go

554
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,039
into the panel uh slide which is for the

555
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,620
model checklist AKA what you need to go

556
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,299
for every single time you're prepping

557
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,160
for your model uh the checklist you

558
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,260
actually need to visit now the set of

559
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,120
progression for a model is

560
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,919
we need to identify that the daily

561
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,140
program is a buy program and we need to

562
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,360
identify a discount a daily discount

563
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
where we're expecting the market to

564
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,799
expand from on The Daily time frame the

565
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,020
market will always expand from a daily

566
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,240
discount or the market will always start

567
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,760
a buyer program from daily discount what

568
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,020
you're looking for is you're looking for

569
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,760
that program you're look you're trying

570
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,100
to get in sync with to originate from a

571
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,799
daily or high time from discount if it

572
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,539
does not originate from Nighttime from

573
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,179
discount then most likely you're nearing

574
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,360
the end of that program

575
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,580
or you're going to see the market start

576
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,340
to retrace into a discount to then

577
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,280
continue the program or start the new

578
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,600
program

579
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,460
so what you're looking for is you're

580
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,100
looking for the daily time frame to

581
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,380
either retrace into a discount to start

582
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,539
the program or the dating program or

583
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,539
data time frame is just recently

584
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,520
expanding from a discount array and then

585
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,919
you can get in sync with that so

586
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,539
what you're identifying is you're

587
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,820
identifying the daily program

588
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,740
in a buy program you're looking for a

589
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,380
daily program to to be a buy or bullish

590
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,140
and they can transpose this to it for

591
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,179
our program and we're looking for if

592
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,320
you're looking for the far program to

593
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,780
also be a buy program now here's what I

594
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,700
mean with the transpose in the daily

595
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,299
program to a four hour program if

596
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,000
the daily is

597
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
poised to expand in direction of the

598
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,460
autoflow and it's bullish

599
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,659
what you don't want to do is you don't

600
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,539
want to go in and buy

601
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,700
a 15 minute time for execution because I

602
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,159
said or because I said your time for

603
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,440
execution is the 5 or 15 minute discount

604
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,200
or premium array you don't want to go in

605
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,679
and just buy any 5 or 15 minute discount

606
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
every New York session

607
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,720
not every session will see expansion in

608
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,299
Direction autoflow how do you select the

609
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,640
session because our job of the model let

610
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,860
me rephrase this and if you're taking

611
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,320
notes I want you to write this down your

612
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,059
notepad because it really is important

613
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,159
to the model and to the success of the

614
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,659
model

615
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,120
it's not just enough to identify

616
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,159
the data program

617
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,679
and that the daily program is willing to

618
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,700
see expansion to the terminals we also

619
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,620
need to identify that the lower time

620
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,640
frame is in sync with the daily profile

621
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,880
or program so what do I mean by that if

622
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,299
the daily is seen expansion higher we

623
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,080
want to see the 4r trade into a far

624
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,539
discount and continue the expansion

625
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,679
higher

626
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,400
don't want to buy if the 4r time frame

627
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,220
is retracing into a discount at a far

628
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,539
time Furniture trades into a discount

629
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,000
then the one hour time frame and the 15

630
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,799
minute time frame they're going to be

631
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,140
bearish and if you try to buy if their

632
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,419
Bearer should go on to lose money

633
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,340
and by the time the market retracing so

634
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,419
far uh discount for the for our program

635
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,860
to resume in the direction of daily

636
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,960
program you've already lost Equity by

637
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,760
then and when it's time for you to pick

638
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,200
your trade there's probably no

639
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,460
ammunition left for you to pick your

640
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,200
trades because maybe you've met your

641
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
risk limit for the week or for the day

642
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,460
and now you're pissed off and this is

643
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,419
where a lot of you guys are going to

644
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:43,559
struggle you're going to struggle with

645
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,039
the patient aspect of this model

646
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,340
the model involves patients every week

647
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,140
you're going to get two to three

648
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,720
opportunities to trade in direction of

649
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,760
the data program or weekly autoflow

650
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,380
essentially the weekly order flow is

651
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,000
going to be the data program

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
and your job is to wait for the four

653
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,580
hour time frame to align with the

654
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,740
thought with the data profile because

655
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,419
the far-time is aligning with big

656
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,419
profile then the 1R programs also go

657
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,640
into align with the for our program so

658
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,679
here's what I mean with this so we're

659
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,360
going to go into a blank chart I'm going

660
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,000
to describe exactly what this should

661
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,520
look like for a trading okay this part

662
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,659
of the model

663
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,760
which is the set of progression I'm

664
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,679
going to describe how it should look

665
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,840
like for your model

666
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,240
so now let's go and break the sound on a

667
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,919
daily time frame and I'm gonna do some

668
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,320
very quick drawings here and hopefully

669
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,059
this makes sense

670
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,419
if we have a let's assume that this is a

671
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,700
daily range okay

672
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,260
and

673
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,059
I'm gonna use this

674
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,460
and we're seeing lower prices on daily

675
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,740
time frame and we of course to believe

676
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,480
that the dating time frame should be

677
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
bullish

678
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,059
and we see

679
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,039
daily time frame actually start to

680
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,140
resume bullishness and we see a shift in

681
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,480
structure or the market break in a

682
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,580
previous high that is a shifting

683
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,779
structure when we're anticipating

684
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,779
bullshits that what we're looking for is

685
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,700
we don't want to buy

686
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,880
until the daily time retraces down into

687
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,679
a daily discount

688
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,380
because the market has to again remember

689
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,580
what I talked about with

690
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,500
Premium versus discount

691
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,140
don't want to buy while the price is

692
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,840
expensive want to buy when it is cheap

693
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,500
this goes for the daily time frame

694
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,299
for our time frame

695
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,120
one hour time frame and then ultimately

696
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,179
the 15 minute time frame so meaning if

697
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,100
we're looking to be a buyer in direction

698
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,679
of daily autoflow again the daily time

699
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,799
frame creates the entire framework

700
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,960
creates our sentiment

701
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,720
so if our conclusion from the daily time

702
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,159
frame is we're looking for bullishness

703
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,919
and we have an objective from liquidity

704
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,779
then we want to make sure that if we

705
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,380
want to be a buyer we're not buying at a

706
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,380
15 minute discount that is inside a 4r

707
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,679
premium I'm sure what it looks like

708
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,039
now inside this daily time frame let's

709
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,779
assume this leg is not actually formed

710
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,720
and this is a discount here we're

711
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,340
anticipating some kind of bullishness on

712
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,460
the daily time frame all right now as

713
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,200
the market retraces down into that

714
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,640
discount

715
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,860
on the far time frame on our time frame

716
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,380
you're going to see more Down Candles or

717
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,659
bearishness in bars as Market retraces

718
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,700
down there

719
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,039
while the markets are tracing lower like

720
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,659
this

721
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,960
now let's zoom in on this one here I

722
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,539
want to zoom in on this this retracement

723
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,520
lowering price

724
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,340
okay so inside this data type remember

725
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,620
this is a data time frame as the market

726
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,440
is retracing down into a daily high or

727
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,360
higher time from discount we're looking

728
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,880
at a daily uh some form of inefficiency

729
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,279
right as the markets are tracing down

730
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,179
there

731
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,659
on a for a time from a wisdom enclosure

732
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,460
what you're going to see is you're going

733
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,740
to see that the far time frame is

734
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,200
retracing like this or it's bearish

735
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,700
you're going to see bearishness on the

736
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,799
forest however now what you don't want

737
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,539
to do here is you don't want to go in

738
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,340
and try to buy

739
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,740
okay you don't want to buy any shift and

740
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,120
structure

741
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,620
because any shift and structure before

742
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,419
our time frame is just only going to set

743
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,600
the stage for a lower run because the

744
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,779
daily has to get done here for the

745
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,580
program to resume

746
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
now even though the daily program is

747
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,700
bullish

748
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,779
okay the 4r program is not bullish

749
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,120
because we're not yet at a dated

750
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,480
discount for bullishness so ensue on the

751
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
lower timer now this is what I mean when

752
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,140
I say the daily time frame is the

753
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,520
framework for a lower time from

754
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,679
understanding because what a lot of you

755
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,299
guys will do in terms of using this

756
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,880
model is you're not going to wait for

757
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,039
the daily to get down to a level where

758
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,140
we should see expansion higher and then

759
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,000
you're going to go in and look at every

760
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,740
shift and structure on the lower time

761
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,900
frame as a buying opportunity

762
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,840
whereas in fact it's not again remember

763
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,179
the lower time frame is simply to get in

764
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,039
sync with the daily program

765
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,659
go and look at your lower time frame

766
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,520
look at all the asset classes every

767
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,980
asset classes across all-time prayers

768
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,720
since the beginning of trading this is

769
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,760
how it's always been

770
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,980
lower time frame always out to subject

771
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,220
to so to the RSI from Price delivery

772
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,919
so if the data is supposed to expand

773
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,200
higher and there is a daily discount

774
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,419
that we should see price trade down into

775
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,600
for a bullish expansion we don't go in

776
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,240
and go and try to buy any shifting

777
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,559
structure or any uh for our inefficiency

778
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,120
 inefficient so we don't try to

779
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,740
buy there now you can obviously go in

780
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,659
and say you want to sell this but that's

781
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,640
not what this model is teaching you the

782
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,740
model is teaching you to trading sync

783
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,740
with the daily program so if your daily

784
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,020
program is a buy program you want to

785
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,059
Traders Inc with that daily program and

786
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,740
how do you do this

787
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,899
by waiting for

788
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,120
the four programs online with the daily

789
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,100
program and the one hour programs along

790
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,779
with the daily program and then you can

791
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,520
go in on your 15-minute time frame

792
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,700
you're looking at a very specific time

793
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,600
window to trade in One Direction you're

794
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,820
not second guessing directions you're

795
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,200
not second guessing where the market

796
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,299
should up or down into you already know

797
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,700
what you're looking for your job is to

798
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,940
go within a certain time of the day and

799
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,100
look for one thing that's that's what

800
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,720
you're doing

801
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,880
that is all you're doing once you've

802
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,179
validated that the 1R and thorough

803
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,799
programmer aligns with the data program

804
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,399
AKA if the daily is trading down or

805
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,860
going down into a discount what you've

806
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,320
done here is you've identified a 4r

807
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,340
discount inside that daily discount and

808
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,159
then you don't take any action until the

809
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,740
daily time frame gets done there

810
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,720
and as soon as it gets down there guess

811
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,059
what you're going to see a lower time

812
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,159
frame shift and structure and that's all

813
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,000
called institutional sponsorship

814
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,120
the market will always give you Clues of

815
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,740
delivery

816
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,120
and that's what we'll call institution

817
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,039
sponsorship once you get that initial

818
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,720
pop higher

819
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,980
it's not going to be on the daily time

820
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,659
frame again on daily time frame Market

821
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,700
has to get all the way up here for you

822
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,559
to identify shifting structure and

823
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,299
continue other flow we don't need that

824
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,980
we don't need daily time frame expansion

825
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,080
press against it with other flow all we

826
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,279
need to see is we need to see the market

827
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,860
get down there into that high time from

828
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,140
discount and see willingness on a

829
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,260
displace on either the far time frame or

830
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,700
the one hour time frame and that's

831
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,340
enough once you see that then our job is

832
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,740
to then go in and identify

833
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,899
15 minute discount arrays inside that

834
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:02,700
one r or for our discount to buy in sync

835
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,580
with and once we buy from there and we

836
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,740
start to see the market the spacing the

837
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,080
version of autoflow we can repeat the

838
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,360
same process every single time we trade

839
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,159
out into a four hour one hour discount

840
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,860
we buy or every single time will run

841
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,039
below if for our o1r discount we'll look

842
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,679
for a lower time frame again 15 minute

843
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,899
shifting structure and then we buy

844
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:29,419
during that time window

845
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,659
it is

846
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,620
all right I think it's a easy peasy

847
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,779
Japanese or something I was just in the

848
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,720
uh Netflix movie I can't remember the

849
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,020
movie it was like easy peasy Japanese

850
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,360
and that's what this is all right it is

851
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,940
a straightforward model it is easy all

852
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,760
you got to do is just you have to wait

853
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,860
I'm gonna do more mindset calls on this

854
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,320
but let's go into the program so the

855
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
daily version of bias and Target

856
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,620
liquidity sets the stage for our model

857
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,320
it is the backbone of our model being

858
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,899
possible and once we've identified our

859
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,539
data program and the draw again it's not

860
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,039
just enough to identify the program we

861
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,080
also need to know where the daily time

862
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,720
frame is reaching for and that is what

863
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,419
creates what I call displacement or one

864
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,640
titlemeness again without displacement

865
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,539
you cannot make money without the market

866
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,860
expanding you're not going to make money

867
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,600
so you want to identify market

868
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,960
conditions that are poised to expand and

869
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,760
that's how you make money and they're

870
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,860
poised to expand into level of your

871
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,019
objective

872
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,080
we seek the H4 program to align with

873
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,659
database and we want to see the far

874
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,980
candles retracing to a4r discount for

875
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,480
our setup anticipation just like I

876
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,700
talked about here right so if you're

877
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,220
looking for daily bushness then you

878
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,260
don't want to go and buy Wayne the far

879
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,059
time frames are tracing to a daily

880
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,000
discount you want to wait for the far

881
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,039
time from also the one hour time going

882
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,320
to trace into that daily discount and

883
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
then you go and hunt your setup you

884
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,119
don't hunt your setup until the market

885
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,239
gets into your anticipated level of

886
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,719
expansion or unless the market has

887
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,460
started the expansion from that discount

888
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,980
then you can go and hunt your setup on

889
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,918
the lower time frame your M15 setups

890
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,560
will form inside each one Auto blocks

891
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,119
bullish Auto blocks so we're talking

892
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,399
about buy programming again uh for cell

893
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,960
programs you just want to reverse what

894
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,239
I'm saying and it'll work your soul side

895
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,000
or assault programs

896
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,800
all right so for buy programs we're

897
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,339
looking for a 15-minute setup which will

898
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,760
form inside a 1R either bullshitter

899
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,520
block forever Gap or cells now let me

900
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,260
talk about this a little bit more

901
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,300
there are only three periods we use for

902
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,219
a model again I'm not going to specify

903
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,139
what PD array on the model because we're

904
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,720
using three and it depends again on what

905
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
is present

906
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,599
during that time window where we're

907
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,940
hunting our setup we're only looking for

908
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,859
three

909
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:08,700
premium or discount per race either an

910
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,880
autoblock if you're about a gap or a

911
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,380
breaker block

912
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,500
this is the only three PD errors we're

913
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,599
looking for over hunting

914
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,460
nothing else

915
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,079
we're not looking for anything else just

916
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,700
no new terminology new complex theme or

917
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,040
any sort of thing where only idle

918
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,740
looking for an autoblock

919
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,560
breaker block

920
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,540
or inefficiency that's what we're

921
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,339
looking for

922
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,339
and we buy from there or we sell from

923
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,040
there depending on the data program

924
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,560
we want to trade our model when the 1R

925
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,260
and 4r program aligns with the data

926
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,119
program yeah we don't want to trade I'm

927
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,339
reiterating this multiple times because

928
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,920
it really is important to our model we

929
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,079
only want to execute on our model when

930
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,060
it is in alignment with the daily

931
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,320
program

932
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,460
don't want to trade our model when the

933
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,560
one hour time frame and for our time

934
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,960
frame does not align with our program

935
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,280
AKA if the data is retracing

936
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,859
and we see a one hour time frame shift

937
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,619
and structure on the buy side we don't

938
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,300
go and buy

939
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
any discount on the one hour time frame

940
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,400
because we understand that any shift

941
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,099
instructor hire only sets the stage for

942
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,380
a run lower into that high time from

943
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,599
discount and that's how you can frame

944
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,500
shift and structure versus random

945
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,200
liquidity or runs and stops using the

946
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,560
daily program or the daily levels that's

947
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,320
how your data levels are very key on

948
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,599
your intraday charts we want to Trader

949
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,220
model when the one hour program for our

950
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,480
program aligns with the daily program

951
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,760
and we do not need to Target data

952
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,800
liquidity to make money we simply need

953
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,079
to aim for a lower timeframe Target in

954
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,520
the direction of

955
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,040
of our daily buys to make consistent

956
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,660
income

957
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,599
our go with the model is not sniper

958
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,240
intros or Instagram entries or Twitter

959
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,820
enters I'll go with the model is to make

960
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,000
money and to get wealthy and enrich if

961
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,680
you prioritize this Opera looking for

962
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,480
Sniper interest and looking for entries

963
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
are good for social media you're going

964
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,680
to do extremely well

965
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,780
extremely well with this model I'm

966
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,220
promising you this and the reason I

967
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,540
promising this because I want to go and

968
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,579
back test this yourself and you'll be

969
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,579
mindful you're like I knew a lot of you

970
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:33,839
guys are listening to this right now you

971
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,579
already know this model you already knew

972
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,660
this model

973
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,040
all I'm doing is I'm giving you a

974
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,380
framework to operate with the model you

975
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,099
already know this model

976
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,660
but you're still shocked like this is so

977
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,820
simple yes it is that's what a model is

978
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,460
supposed to look like every model that

979
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,160
is successful Finds Its success in its

980
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,420
Simplicity that's all

981
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,720
let's go into the third progression um I

982
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,000
believe we've covered this on this slide

983
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,099
but we're gonna you know flesh this out

984
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,079
a little bit more on this slot here and

985
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,280
let's talk about the set of progression

986
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,560
what it looks like conceptually

987
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,839
all right so what you can see here is

988
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,060
the market starts delivery from a daily

989
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,040
discount and that the discount could

990
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
also be an item from discount like a

991
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
weekly discount

992
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
some time very rarely it could be a

993
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,720
monthly discount but we are more focused

994
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
on a daily discount because this is

995
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,820
where majority of your of the framework

996
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,800
of your setup will form

997
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,680
so we see a lower time frame again all

998
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,500
of this is all lower time from expansion

999
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,240
from a daily discount once you see this

1000
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
lower time from expansion we already

1001
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,280
know that we are now in a daily buy

1002
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,540
program

1003
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,859
what we're looking for is we're looking

1004
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,320
to execute when the lower time frame

1005
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,940
program aligns with the dated program

1006
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,280
meaning we don't want to go and buy 15

1007
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,220
times from here or here or here or here

1008
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,920
because they are in a short-term sale

1009
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,480
program even though they do a program

1010
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,000
Supply program again if you're trading

1011
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,820
you want your daily program to align

1012
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,640
with your 1R and for our program so you

1013
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,740
don't want to be buying in a one RSL

1014
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,180
program when the daily program is

1015
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,980
published since I don't want to be

1016
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,560
selling in a one hour buy program when

1017
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,720
the program is bearish you want them all

1018
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,940
to align and this is how you get in sync

1019
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,859
with your model so if the data program

1020
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,380
is bullish you want your lower time from

1021
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,060
program to align with the daily program

1022
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,579
AKA you're not buying the lower time

1023
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,380
frame when it is at premium you're

1024
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,480
buying them where they are when they are

1025
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,000
at discount relative to their own

1026
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
trading range

1027
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,780
now as a market retraces down into a

1028
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,640
discount usually there's going to be a

1029
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,280
one hour discount or far discount what

1030
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,820
we see or what we seek is we seek a 15

1031
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,079
minute shift in structure okay so as we

1032
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,300
trade down into stock 4r or one hour

1033
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,980
discount we're looking for is we're

1034
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,320
looking for displacement on the lower

1035
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,119
time frame that's going to be a five

1036
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,560
minute time frame sorry that's gonna be

1037
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,240
a fifth sermon time frame or a one hour

1038
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,300
time from usually and our goal is to buy

1039
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,060
a fair value gap on the 15 minute time

1040
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,380
frame or a five minute time frame

1041
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,280
between 7 A.M to 10 a.m Eastern Standard

1042
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,260
Time and this is what I call the

1043
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,760
standard rear condition protocol so

1044
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,500
there are two protocols you're going to

1045
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,839
use for this model again the model is

1046
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,700
the New York Autumn Trail entry model

1047
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,920
but for the New York option trade engine

1048
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,180
model there are two protocols to employ

1049
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,000
for the exact setup

1050
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,640
you have your standard reaccumulation

1051
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,160
protocol for bullish program if you're

1052
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,480
looking for bearish programs you call

1053
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,420
this your standard

1054
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,859
redistribution protocol

1055
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,339
and number two is your offset

1056
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:49,020
reaccumulation protocol for buy programs

1057
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,619
or offset redistribution protocol for

1058
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,900
cell programs now let's differentiate

1059
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,099
these two

1060
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,960
a standard recognition protocol

1061
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,760
essentially is this

1062
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,079
the marker retraces down into a fair

1063
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,820
ball Gap or other block inside this

1064
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,220
range and sees expansion

1065
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,500
usually is going to go below the main

1066
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,960
threshold of the range or equilibrium of

1067
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,240
the range tracing to a discount is going

1068
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,280
to be some kind of inefficiency or

1069
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,740
pollution block a discount then the

1070
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,839
market says expansion this is your

1071
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,240
standard for accumulation protocol

1072
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,220
now for offset recognition protocol

1073
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,500
which is a little more tricky but really

1074
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,180
it's just straightforward the market

1075
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,500
actually runs the range now with the

1076
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,420
standard recognition protocol the market

1077
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,000
maintains the range with the offset

1078
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,520
recognition protocol the Marquette runs

1079
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,160
the range okay and usually what you get

1080
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,859
there is you get a flashing smt

1081
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,380
Divergence oh I just showed you

1082
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,820
something here

1083
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,380
cool right

1084
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,839
you learn more now what you can do here

1085
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,180
and the problem is a lot because for the

1086
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,040
standard break animation protocol

1087
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,140
it's really straightforward right you

1088
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,940
already know this you know you see

1089
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,880
expansion with retracement you buy aim

1090
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,280
for Journal quality shift forward that

1091
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,980
you're looking for now with the officer

1092
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,140
recognition protocol

1093
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,480
the mark actually runs lower the range

1094
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,460
and what a lot of Traders fall is sharp

1095
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,220
into is they go in expecting this kind

1096
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,220
of delivery here and the market just

1097
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,260
falls short of that and then you think

1098
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,359
you know maybe they're wrong in your

1099
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,520
bias all along the market was just

1100
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,800
straight down into a 4r or one hour

1101
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,560
discount to see expansion from again

1102
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,020
what gives context into this as a

1103
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,359
manipulation is your daily directional

1104
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,640
premise and what you can use as a

1105
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,560
confirmation that this was simply a run

1106
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,400
and stop it's comparing the Run lower to

1107
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
a correlated asset so if this is euro

1108
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,020
dollar and Euro dollar is running lower

1109
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,320
into a 4r01r discount

1110
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,099
is GBP US dollar running lower or is

1111
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,260
dollar running higher because you're all

1112
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,900
correlated assets right so if you're

1113
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,240
always running lower we preferably want

1114
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,700
to see dollar running higher which will

1115
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,000
mean that probably to run lower euro

1116
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,220
dollar is the shift in structure and not

1117
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,380
even on stops

1118
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,780
but if euro is running lower into a 4r

1119
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,200
01r discount and dollar is failing to

1120
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,680
run higher then this is simply a play on

1121
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,960
salsa liquidity aka the market is just

1122
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,619
running stops into a level of discount

1123
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,480
where it would allow for reaccumulation

1124
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,520
and then continue version of autoflow

1125
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,740
now you have three options with this

1126
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,680
entry you could either buy once you

1127
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
confirm that Divergence you could have a

1128
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,060
buy under the solo here which I believe

1129
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,440
is a little bit scary for a lot of you

1130
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,819
guys and obviously you're going to have

1131
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,660
to grow into this or you could wait for

1132
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,180
usually I wait for a five minute

1133
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,220
displacement so you can wait for a five

1134
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,780
minute displacement to create an

1135
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,140
inefficiency or bullish on the Block and

1136
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,760
then you buy the retracement into that

1137
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,980
inefficiency or book on either

1138
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,440
a five minute time frame or a 15 minute

1139
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,000
time frame again nothing lower than a

1140
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,800
five minute timer and either a five

1141
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,540
minute time frame or 15 minute time

1142
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,380
frame with stock below this log here and

1143
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,260
you in for your usual Target or you

1144
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,420
could still wait for the market to get

1145
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,160
into the breaker block and once you see

1146
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,440
the market displace through the breaker

1147
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,200
block with a fair bottle Gap you buy the

1148
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,420
retracement into the breaker block with

1149
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,540
your stops below the breaker block

1150
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,280
and that's how you have three inches

1151
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,440
with your offset recognition model so

1152
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,819
with your standard recognition model

1153
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,520
you're buying your standard retracing

1154
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,720
down into your

1155
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,700
618 to 786 Fibonacci level again the

1156
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,140
reason why I have this level on my

1157
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,000
Fibonacci you can use this for your

1158
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,859
Fibonacci when you're looking to be a

1159
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,140
buyer or seller usually anything above

1160
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,660
the mean of a range is what we call

1161
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,579
Premium anything below is what we call

1162
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,920
Discount but if you want to refine the

1163
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,520
range even more you can use your 786 to

1164
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,839
618

1165
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,300
Fibonacci retracement level and then

1166
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,380
what you're looking for is you're

1167
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,440
looking for pdres inside the range so if

1168
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,060
you're looking to be a seller you're

1169
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,560
looking for premium arrays inside your

1170
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,060
786618 Fibonacci level if you're looking

1171
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,460
to be a buyer looking for Discount

1172
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,300
already inside your 786 to 618 Fibonacci

1173
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,339
level and that's where you buy from now

1174
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:33,839
again I don't need them because I

1175
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,079
already know how to eyeball premium or

1176
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,420
disciplinary so again in my opinion is

1177
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,859
not really necessary I don't really use

1178
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:43,260
FIB natural levels like that

1179
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,480
um and more of user the extension levels

1180
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,440
but you can use this as a guy until you

1181
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,660
start to trust your eyes with your model

1182
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,540
you can use this short term

1183
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,400
all right so I'm just get a sip of

1184
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,359
coffee because I'm already

1185
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,660
and uh we're almost getting into an R

1186
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,579
with the model I was thinking it was

1187
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,280
gonna be like 10 20 minutes and it's

1188
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,020
almost an hour with the model that's

1189
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,440
insane

1190
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,579
so

1191
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,680
listen to from where I left off and the

1192
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,599
process of delivering to our daily

1193
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,880
terminals AKA our premium the market

1194
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,339
would do so for a standard

1195
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,140
reaccumulation where just for tracing

1196
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,300
down into a level of inefficiency in

1197
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,940
form of a auto block or fair value Gap

1198
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,300
and continue the program or

1199
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,060
DeMarco actually run old lows in a

1200
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,460
bullish program and then continue to run

1201
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,700
higher now here's the key if you trust

1202
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,180
your daily program whenever we run a

1203
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,460
short-term load you don't view that as a

1204
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,500
breaking structure you look for the

1205
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,400
market to shift and here's the key here

1206
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,760
the market will see the most explosive

1207
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,160
displacement

1208
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,740
in the version of bullishness after

1209
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,920
running Soul stops

1210
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,720
I saw one more time so you'll fully

1211
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,040
grasp what I'm seeing

1212
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,160
price would see the most explosive

1213
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,480
displacement

1214
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
bullish

1215
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,500
in the version of a daily bullishness

1216
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,339
after a run on Cell stops at discount

1217
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:24,900
this has to happen at discount again the

1218
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,420
key thing here for either of the

1219
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,099
protocol

1220
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,400
is a lower time from program meaning

1221
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,720
once you've identified your daily

1222
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,640
program in this example it is bullish

1223
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,560
you're not doing anything onto your

1224
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,480
lower timeframe program aligns with your

1225
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,760
daily program AKA you want your lower

1226
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,480
time frame on both the 4r and 1R to be

1227
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,240
at the discount once your four hour one

1228
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,940
hour time frame are both at discount

1229
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,880
then you can go and hunt your setups on

1230
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,339
your 15 minute time frame within your

1231
00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:00,560
time window which is 7 A.M to 10 a.m

1232
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,319
Eastern Standard Time

1233
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,480
and you're looking for either these two

1234
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,579
protocols I'm going to show you on a

1235
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,960
live setting or I'm going to use the

1236
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,819
charts actually to show you and then

1237
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,260
this week we're going to do more live

1238
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,300
setting executions with the model

1239
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,440
and this is what you're looking for this

1240
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
essentially is your model

1241
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,700
this is your this is your model and you

1242
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,800
can see the time under here 7 A.M to 10

1243
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,599
a.m Eastern that's the window of

1244
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,160
opportunity for your model and nothing

1245
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,940
outside that

1246
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,839
this is when you're looking to trick

1247
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,040
your model

1248
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,240
are you looking to trade this in

1249
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,440
direction of data autoflow

1250
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,140
now let's go into the final part of the

1251
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,720
video and painfully we're coming towards

1252
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,160
the end of the video because I really

1253
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,440
did enjoy this video I did enjoy this

1254
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,880
video

1255
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,319
um so we're going to talk about our

1256
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,599
checklist what are the checklists that

1257
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,300
we require for our model every single

1258
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,880
time we stop on the charts before the

1259
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,280
window of opportunity starts for us what

1260
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,780
are we looking to go for to remind

1261
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,640
ourselves the four ways to kit on our

1262
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,920
model number what we need to define the

1263
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,079
daily buy or sell program and identify

1264
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,359
the journal liquidity we only Scout

1265
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,640
setups when the daily Sports in the

1266
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,220
space remember we make money when we see

1267
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,020
the spaceman if there's a lack of

1268
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,359
displacement we don't make money we

1269
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,680
don't make money in ranges or

1270
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,800
consolidations we make money when

1271
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,000
both the daily 4r and 1R program is

1272
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,240
poised to see expansion

1273
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,060
number two we transpose key daily or

1274
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,819
week levels to lower time frame charts

1275
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,160
okay so we want to make sure that our

1276
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,800
key data levels are on our intraday

1277
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,480
chart so when you identify your daily

1278
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,140
viewers I identify the key levels on

1279
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,700
your daily time frame you don't remove

1280
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,859
them from your charts

1281
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,319
a lot of times when I say a lot of times

1282
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,440
I mean 80 of the time intraday expansion

1283
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,260
will form from those levels and that's

1284
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,359
why it release kids of your daily levels

1285
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,240
on your intraday chart

1286
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,400
number three you want to identify your

1287
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,940
H4 and H1 so when I say H4 I mean your

1288
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,859
4r I'm going to say each one I mean

1289
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,480
you're one R so you want to identify

1290
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,560
your H4 and each one discount and

1291
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,220
premium arrays around key daily or

1292
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,619
weekly levels so once you've identified

1293
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,480
your daily level that does not mean

1294
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,099
you've removed that level from your

1295
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,079
chart you keep them on your chart and

1296
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,440
then go and look for lower time frame

1297
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,380
discount or premium around those key

1298
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,400
levels to even refine

1299
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,220
your levels more for your intraday

1300
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,540
training

1301
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,220
okay the way you want to do after that

1302
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,140
is number four you want to confirm that

1303
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,240
your 4r and one hour program aligns with

1304
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,619
the data program now this is really key

1305
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,960
this is the base for execution you don't

1306
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,000
execute until your for our program and

1307
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,040
when our program aligns with your data

1308
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,380
program and after you've done that then

1309
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,960
number five you identify a lower time

1310
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,059
frame buy side liquidity and the daily

1311
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,160
buy program and a one hour time from

1312
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,079
cell solid liquidity in a data cell

1313
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,940
program so what you're looking for is

1314
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,680
you're looking for a one now this is

1315
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,300
supposed to be corrected here you're

1316
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,099
looking for a 1R

1317
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,099
buy solid liquidity or 15 minute Buy

1318
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:28,200
sell liquidity predated by program and

1319
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,720
then you just flip this for a you know a

1320
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,859
data solve program once your 4r and 1R

1321
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:38,760
program aligns okay

1322
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,000
you want the low or high of the day to

1323
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,020
form around a daily or weekly level

1324
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,380
again 80 of the time the low or high

1325
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,740
intraday will form around key higher

1326
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,260
time from levels and that's why every

1327
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,619
single time you go into your chart

1328
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:01,020
always leave your hard time from levels

1329
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,540
on your lower time frame charts they

1330
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,059
will influence the delivery on the lower

1331
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:08,040
time frame charts

1332
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,140
number seven the daily buy program

1333
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,599
you're looking for price to trade below

1334
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,420
12 a.m Eastern Standard Time

1335
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,740
and so I'll call the bullish

1336
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,960
accumulation phase and in the daily cell

1337
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,280
program you're looking for price to

1338
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,980
trade above 12 a.m Eastern Standard Time

1339
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,720
now I've taught about the daily candle

1340
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,160
so let me just quickly do a reaction

1341
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,240
this and I'll go into the next slide

1342
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,040
this is what a daily bullish candle

1343
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,180
looks like

1344
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,599
you have your opening price

1345
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,420
and then you have the low of that candle

1346
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,160
the market will open from the opening

1347
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,319
price from lower

1348
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:45,720
and then go back up above the open price

1349
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,380
and that point where it went lower

1350
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,960
becomes the weak of the daily Bush

1351
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,339
candle

1352
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,500
and then from there it starts to expand

1353
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,500
above the open price and goes up into a

1354
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,140
short-term premium where when it gets up

1355
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,619
into that it starts to pull back

1356
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,540
and that point where I started to pull

1357
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,599
back is what creates the high of your

1358
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,280
daily bullish candle and this is all the

1359
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,660
daily candle looks like

1360
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,760
you have your open

1361
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,420
low high close

1362
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,280
no

1363
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,220
in a daily bullish candle

1364
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,099
we expect this for a daily buy program

1365
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,619
and then for a daily cell program we're

1366
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,440
expecting a daily bearish candle

1367
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,920
all right now in a daily bullish candle

1368
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,520
price will accumulate below true day

1369
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,020
open now we don't use midnight GMT time

1370
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,839
for our opening price we're using

1371
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,240
midnight New York time for open products

1372
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,099
so the same way it did the bullish

1373
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,020
candle would see

1374
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,540
initial run lower below the opening

1375
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,460
price that open price is what we use as

1376
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,420
Sofia

1377
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,160
Eastern Standard Time

1378
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,960
so if we're looking for bullshness we

1379
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,359
want to see

1380
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,859
price

1381
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,500
on that day run below

1382
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,260
tough air midnight time if we have not

1383
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,720
seen price run below that time by New

1384
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,720
York then we expect New York to do so if

1385
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,920
we don't get that then we don't take any

1386
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,119
trades

1387
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,220
irregardless if the market expands guess

1388
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,260
our Target objective this is the

1389
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,359
protocol this is the checklist that's

1390
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,059
what you have to follow

1391
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,700
all right so for a daily Bush program we

1392
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,559
want to see the market trade below 12

1393
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,960
a.m in New York your daily self program

1394
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,760
I want to see the market trade above 12

1395
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,819
a.m New York because that is what sets

1396
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,940
the initial accumulation phase for that

1397
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,920
daily range

1398
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,839
all right so going into the next part of

1399
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,940
the checklist which number eight we like

1400
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,700
to see the high of the day which stands

1401
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,220
for hod or low of the day which stands

1402
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,280
for LOD form around daily or weekly

1403
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,760
levels and we aim to and we aim for the

1404
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,819
previous day's low or high I'm sorry the

1405
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,800
query drops now this is basic profit

1406
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,599
taking

1407
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,760
majority of the time the market would

1408
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,400
trade above the purposes high in the

1409
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,079
daily bullish program

1410
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,300
or the previous stage low in a daily

1411
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,760
bearish program and this is

1412
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,160
quote unquote this is what we can use as

1413
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,400
you know take profit areas as atrocity

1414
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,099
profit areas right this is like basic

1415
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,680
price understanding is markets expanded

1416
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,300
lower obviously we need a short term low

1417
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,520
to six cells on liquidity

1418
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,040
I already showed you that here all right

1419
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,200
so we have a bicycle to pull or lower

1420
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,839
time from salsa liquid to pull if we are

1421
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,460
buying a discount they want to see the

1422
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,260
market seek the most premium price which

1423
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,020
is a short-term high if we're buying or

1424
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,119
if we're selling a premium you want to

1425
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,400
see the market sick the most discounted

1426
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,920
price which is self-sal equitable

1427
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,319
and that is what the previously is high

1428
00:55:55,319 --> 00:56:00,000
or low offers for our intraday Traders

1429
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,280
we identify standard rear accumulation

1430
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,760
protocol or offset recognition protocol

1431
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,160
based on proximity to key daily or for

1432
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,980
our levels so if we have not carried out

1433
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,780
into a key for our 1R daily level and we

1434
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,460
see the market just making sure to know

1435
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,700
just before that then we expect New York

1436
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,359
to be a offset recognition protocol in

1437
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:25,920
which

1438
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,920
retail will look too long inside this

1439
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,160
old range while we aim for the market to

1440
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,740
run cell side and trade down into that

1441
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,160
key level to buy from either we buy as

1442
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,660
soon as we're touching that level or

1443
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,000
we'll wait for a lower time frame

1444
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,460
displacement so what lower type are we

1445
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,780
looking at we're looking at a five

1446
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,940
minute time frame or a 15-minute time

1447
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,819
frame we seek a display spanning form of

1448
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:52,800
a fair value gap or identify a bush of

1449
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,500
the block and we buy from that expecting

1450
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,380
immediate displacement when we trade

1451
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,540
with this kind of protocol not the

1452
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,579
standard recognition phase which is the

1453
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,040
standard protocol for New York I'm

1454
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,240
talking about the offset recognition

1455
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,559
protocol

1456
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,660
when we're using this protocol for our

1457
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,599
trade entries we seek speed and delivery

1458
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,440
the delivery after on a stop is usually

1459
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,540
faster than the delivery with the

1460
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,400
standard recognition because the market

1461
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,020
has already run to see counterparty

1462
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,200
liquidity and what price will do a lot

1463
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,119
of times this price will sink to quickly

1464
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,940
put all the chairs were selling the Run

1465
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,740
lower here because there's going to be a

1466
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,000
lot of shares who are selling short

1467
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,240
they'll run below the the range as the

1468
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,859
market runs lower there

1469
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,980
retail is induced short and anyone who

1470
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,480
was buying inside this range you're

1471
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,280
stopped out and then Demarco is an

1472
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,220
aggressive run in Russian autoflow

1473
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,380
so the speed of delivery with offset

1474
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,940
recognition is usually faster than that

1475
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,180
of your standard recumulation right and

1476
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,619
then um

1477
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,780
number 10 your pair selection let's talk

1478
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,520
about pair selection real quick if

1479
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,900
you're going to trade an asset you want

1480
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,160
to trade the pair that's shown a

1481
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,680
willingness on a displace individual

1482
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,079
digital autoflow against a reference

1483
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,020
meaning you're looking to trade in

1484
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,520
leadership

1485
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,160
a lot of times you guys will have the

1486
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,079
right bias for dollar less used all for

1487
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,119
example so let's say your anticipating

1488
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,880
in dollars to trade higher without the

1489
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,500
right buyers for dollar trading high but

1490
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,480
then you go and select a pair that's not

1491
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,280
showing any winners want to trade

1492
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,200
higher with dollar

1493
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,059
and this is what messenger analysis are

1494
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,619
because you have you have the right buys

1495
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,180
you have the right sentiment but you're

1496
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,099
just selecting the wrong pair because

1497
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,500
the player selecting is what I call the

1498
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,440
sympathetic pair or the seek pair you

1499
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,660
don't want to select the sick pair the

1500
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,059
sick pair is always the pair that has

1501
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,099
shown a lack of willingness to want to

1502
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,260
displace right so the parachute on the

1503
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,940
lockableness want to displace

1504
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,799
you're not training that this adds a

1505
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,020
sick pair or the sympathetic pair you're

1506
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,940
always looking for leadership meaning if

1507
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,859
dollar is expanding higher

1508
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,380
the payer trading if it's positively

1509
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,420
correlated with dollar should be

1510
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,599
expanded higher or if it is negative the

1511
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,859
character with dollar should be

1512
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,579
expanding lower

1513
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,480
number 11 you want to identify Market

1514
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,819
protraction at New York now the same way

1515
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,579
I just taught you with your daily candle

1516
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,760
where from the open price or microc and

1517
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,520
initial false quote-unquote false front

1518
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,299
lower which induces early results so

1519
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:30,180
short and then incisions go and then buy

1520
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,180
against veto sentiment you want to see

1521
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,059
the same thing for New York so meaning

1522
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:37,740
when I see you're looking for

1523
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,920
marketraction and New York open

1524
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,040
once New York starts which is 7 A.M and

1525
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,680
ends which is 10 a.m if you're looking

1526
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,119
for bullishness

1527
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,240
you're looking for the market to do this

1528
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,240
the price at which that session opened

1529
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,920
is what we'll call the opening price for

1530
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,559
New York if you want to be a buyer you

1531
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,260
want to be buying anywhere below the

1532
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,760
open price

1533
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,920
or you want to see the market trade

1534
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,380
below the open price for New York

1535
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,900
again you don't necessarily need to buy

1536
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,579
below.com prices you just need to see

1537
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,319
that the market has traded below the

1538
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,180
open price if you can buy below the open

1539
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,579
price that is preferable preferable

1540
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,319
that's what we prefer that's what we

1541
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,900
want now sometimes you might not get the

1542
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,859
Bible below the open price

1543
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,819
but you want to see the market has done

1544
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,260
that same way you want to see the market

1545
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,859
trade below 12 a.m midnight New York in

1546
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,440
a daily push overflow or daily bullish

1547
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,700
program

1548
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,020
you want to see the same thing happen

1549
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,760
for New York so you want to see the

1550
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,059
market tree below 7 A.M Eastern Standard

1551
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,460
Time so there are two times in the daily

1552
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,660
program running through the market trade

1553
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,200
below onto the market trade below 12 a.m

1554
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,040
Eastern Standard Time and 7 A.M it's

1555
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,299
your Center time

1556
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:57,720
and these are your checklist criteria

1557
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,900
for your model

1558
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,960
number 12 you're identifying a 15-minute

1559
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,859
or one hour high or low for take profit

1560
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:09,119
objective I already talked about this

1561
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,119
before and number 13 which is the last

1562
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,059
one you want to place your stop two PD

1563
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,660
arrays above or below your 5 minute or

1564
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,119
15 minute PD array selected so if you're

1565
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,720
buying at a five minute farewell Gap if

1566
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,040
there's a bullshitter block below the

1567
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,839
farewell Gap they want to place your

1568
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,359
stops not just below the farewell Gap

1569
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:31,920
you're buying from but also below the

1570
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,780
both shutter block because the market

1571
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,460
could trade Through the Fair ball Gap

1572
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,140
and trade into your auto block and still

1573
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,400
be valid

1574
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,599
or let's say if you're buying a five

1575
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,720
minute CB or busy not not civi if you're

1576
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,880
buying a five minute busy

1577
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,740
and then you have the fair value Gap

1578
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,720
below the busy that you want to place

1579
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,780
your stops below the fair Volga okay

1580
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,400
because marketing trade for the busy

1581
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,140
trading to the fair value Gap and still

1582
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,420
be valid so a general rule of thumb now

1583
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,380
stops is not a fixed protocol okay there

1584
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,780
it's something that you

1585
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,799
depending on that current market profile

1586
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,960
you utilize it and I'll do more videos

1587
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,119
and stops and I think on the next one

1588
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,160
right but a general rule of thumb is you

1589
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,440
want to please if you stop to pierce

1590
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,500
above or below the pdre selected for

1591
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,020
your executions

1592
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,079
and uh we are almost done with the model

1593
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,960
and now let's go and look at some actual

1594
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,880
examples and price

1595
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,859
now I'm sure you guys are probably

1596
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,900
thinking yourself well this model is

1597
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,059
complicated it's too much there's so

1598
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,260
many checklists I need to go through

1599
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,720
there's this science student that means

1600
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,579
you're stabbing to do

1601
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:47,220
it's not I'm gonna show you how quickly

1602
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,140
you can get all of this now obviously

1603
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,460
it's easy for me because I've been doing

1604
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,500
this for years and the Finish you just

1605
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,299
need a few months to get acclimatized

1606
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:56,520
with this model and you're good to go so

1607
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,599
once you get that console with the model

1608
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,119
you don't necessarily need to go through

1609
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,460
long checklist you just know the key

1610
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,440
things you're looking for and once you

1611
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,299
open the charts either they're there or

1612
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,160
they're not and you're good to go all

1613
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,079
right so now we're gonna use

1614
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,780
gbps dollar from last week's price

1615
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,079
action to show examples with our model

1616
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,880
all right so we're going to go and look

1617
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,040
for cable

1618
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,359
by the way jpu is always called cable

1619
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,980
sometimes I write on my tweet I'll write

1620
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,599
like cable should do this and people

1621
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:28,859
still ask some questions like what's

1622
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:32,940
Cable cable is pound dollar this is what

1623
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,099
we call Cable your dollar is all called

1624
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,119
fiber you as a cat is all called Looney

1625
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,460
okay I want to call them those names by

1626
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,079
those additional that's the name to call

1627
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,319
them

1628
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:48,119
all right so what we're gonna do here

1629
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,859
with a pound

1630
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,680
let me actually remove Tuesday's data

1631
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,299
range we're going to use a replay tool

1632
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:56,880
to simulate like uh if it's not

1633
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,160
simulating real time trading because

1634
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,079
there's no money involved we're gonna

1635
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,400
use the replay so it's kind of like

1636
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,339
Pretend We're trading live settings all

1637
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,440
right so now listen to the analysis here

1638
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,780
let's identify our key higher time frame

1639
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,940
levels and then Define our program

1640
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:23,640
all right so let me go to a forex.com

1641
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,799
and see if I can identify that there

1642
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:46,740
so I'm gonna again I'm gonna go back and

1643
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,660
use the replay tool here

1644
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,839
foreign

1645
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:54,240
I'm going all the way out to a weekly

1646
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,260
time frame

1647
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,640
if you look to your left you can see

1648
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,339
very closely that we have a weekly

1649
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:02,099
volume and balance here so if you look

1650
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,200
at this gap between these two candles

1651
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,720
that's an actual Market Gap there

1652
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,640
all right be I'll go remember that in

1653
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,020
the future if that that's a long time

1654
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,760
this formed around

1655
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,940
April 22nd over a year ago the algo

1656
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,940
still will remember these levels

1657
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,220
so we have this weekly inefficiency here

1658
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:24,240
and the primary of that Weekly

1659
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,900
Gap starts at the close of this candle

1660
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,940
which is 1.3 1.29 so we're going to use

1661
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,940
1.31129

1662
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,900
as the primary of our inefficiency and

1663
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,339
usually what I like is I like to make

1664
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:44,280
with levels red a very deep dark red

1665
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,319
weekly monthly levels like to make them

1666
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,540
that color scheme and then the discount

1667
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,420
low of our weekly and efficiency

1668
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,520
starts at the open price of this candle

1669
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,299
which is

1670
01:05:56,299 --> 01:06:00,420
1.30950 okay so 1.3 is there

1671
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,299
five zero that's a discount load there

1672
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:05,760
and that's our premium and if we trade

1673
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,099
through this level here then we have to

1674
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:10,079
contend with the

1675
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,720
projection block and then this small

1676
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,220
loot of fair value so you look at the

1677
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,020
slower Scandal high of the Scandal I

1678
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,700
know we have a wrong balance here we

1679
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,960
have a small wheelchair value Gap there

1680
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,760
that we still have to contend with so

1681
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,960
we're not really going to concern

1682
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,299
ourselves with these levels here because

1683
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:26,099
you're so far away from this level until

1684
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,900
we trade for this level

1685
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,579
we're really going to need to have all

1686
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:31,920
these levels in our charts all right so

1687
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,140
we're done with that on the weekly time

1688
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,079
frame now let's go into can we identify

1689
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,299
anything else on with the time frame uh

1690
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:40,980
the only thing we can see is this weekly

1691
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,200
 work here so

1692
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,000
we're gonna outline

1693
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,819
the suitable shot block as our discount

1694
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:50,460
so we have Wikipedia shutter block as

1695
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,400
our discount and then we go to our daily

1696
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,260
time frame and this is what we'll call

1697
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,240
the top down analysis right so we're

1698
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,220
going from a weaker time frame down to a

1699
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,359
daily time frame

1700
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:02,579
and what we can identify here

1701
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:04,980
again let's use the money syringe you

1702
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,859
can see here we have a daily

1703
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:09,420
discount

1704
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,299
okay and the daily discount is this

1705
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:14,819
daily bullish per Volga

1706
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:17,579
I like to use purple for my daily levels

1707
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,240
to just a different shape both

1708
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,119
now what we have with this DB discount

1709
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,520
is

1710
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,220
we have the discount load the

1711
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,599
inefficiency the primary begin

1712
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:32,760
efficiency and then if we use our

1713
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,740
Fibonacci for mods low here

1714
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,099
we have the 50 which is the constant

1715
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,859
encroachment of our inefficiency

1716
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,380
or discount array

1717
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,720
and we're done

1718
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,760
now the questions let's identify what

1719
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,480
the program is

1720
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,319
we have traded up we've seen serious

1721
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,640
expansion up into a weekly premium

1722
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,319
it makes sense to express a kind of

1723
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,440
logical distribution lower now if we're

1724
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,140
going to distribute from here

1725
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:15,380
where is a discount that we can aim for

1726
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,000
we can aim for a distribal gap here we

1727
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,560
can also infer the cerebellum up here so

1728
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,080
we have two inefficiencies lower to aim

1729
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,899
for now I don't want to add those levels

1730
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:27,000
here because it'll just clutter the

1731
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,979
charts so I'm going to leave them until

1732
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,620
we trade below this discount

1733
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,219
and our key here is if we're looking for

1734
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:36,839
weakness AKA we're looking for

1735
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:38,640
distribution after all of this expansion

1736
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,140
we don't want to see the market trade

1737
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,979
above this as a premium now why because

1738
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:46,080
if we trade Above This weak level as a

1739
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,660
premium the next premium for us to trade

1740
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,060
up into and see any bearish retracement

1741
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,880
from is all the way up here if we go

1742
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,859
back to a weaker time frame

1743
01:08:55,859 --> 01:09:00,140
you can see the next premium is here

1744
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:04,439
and that is how many pictures is that

1745
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,520
from here

1746
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,259
that's around

1747
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:10,400
if we measure the post

1748
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:15,359
that's around 100 plus fips 100 plus

1749
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,920
supposed to get to Next Level premium

1750
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,040
and C bearish distribution from so we

1751
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,799
know that if the market loses this level

1752
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,439
on a daily time frame the lower time

1753
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,939
frame is going to be in the buy program

1754
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,500
because it has to get all the way up

1755
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,339
here for its then retrace or see a

1756
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,799
little bit of a consolidation so

1757
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,899
we've created protocols for our daily

1758
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,479
buys right so our daily device is a

1759
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,580
bearish retracement until getting to a

1760
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,520
discount and that discount can be either

1761
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,580
this one this one or this weekly

1762
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,859
discount before we see a resumption in

1763
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:51,960
the buyer program now let's go on the

1764
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,859
lower time frame we've already

1765
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,900
identified our key date levels and what

1766
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,460
you can see here is I'm leaving the key

1767
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,679
weekly and daily levels here not doing

1768
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:00,480
anything to it all right so the lower

1769
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,800
time frame we're going to the one hour

1770
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,420
time frame and I'm not going to go

1771
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,600
through and look at the uh checklist one

1772
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,040
by one because I already know them right

1773
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,300
so I'm just going to run through each

1774
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:13,340
and every one of them Okay so

1775
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,120
and what I'm looking for is I'm looking

1776
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,760
for the time window which is 7 AM to 10

1777
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,460
a.m Eastern for my trade

1778
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,679
so I'm not concerned really

1779
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:26,640
with what price is doing until

1780
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,060
a time without opportunity which is here

1781
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,739
and also what the market wants to do so

1782
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:33,719
so far in bearish as long as we don't

1783
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:36,360
lose this level all right so now this is

1784
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,739
what the market does living up into

1785
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:44,120
our time frame

1786
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:49,140
K and server time frame now the daily

1787
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,360
program which we're anticipating is a

1788
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,860
bearish program that's where

1789
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,219
anticipating we are at a key weekly

1790
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:58,980
level here but the lower time frame

1791
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:02,100
program is a buy program

1792
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,860
okay the lower time for program is not a

1793
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,480
self-program yet because we're not

1794
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,360
seeing bearish delivering price we're

1795
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,179
still seeing consolidation and then a

1796
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:13,800
run higher

1797
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,420
now I could go a little bit more and say

1798
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,159
well this is the one this consolidation

1799
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:18,900
and this is your Judo swing and which is

1800
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,820
he bearishness and price but I'm not

1801
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,159
really interested in this so again we're

1802
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,960
not really going to execute on this

1803
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,260
because we're not confirmed yet that the

1804
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,300
data program is bearish okay what we're

1805
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,620
looking for is we're anticipating data

1806
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,239
programs and bearish I want to see the

1807
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:34,679
lower time frame aligned with that

1808
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,320
program so far it's not aligned with

1809
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,699
that program yet because I've not seen

1810
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:41,159
the market show any Wellness on the

1811
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,540
display slower so we're not really

1812
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,420
interested until we spot a Wilderness

1813
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,640
and price I want to split slower but

1814
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,620
again remember where I saw the key

1815
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,460
weekly premium

1816
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,860
and our single Market shook willingness

1817
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,540
I want to display slower

1818
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,540
inside our time window from that key

1819
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:08,120
with the level and what can we identify

1820
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,820
on the one hour time frame what's the 1R

1821
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,320
timeframe program

1822
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,920
here

1823
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,860
it's a cell program now because we've

1824
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,260
taken out a short-term low

1825
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,900
a hard time from inefficiency

1826
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,480
after running out buy stop so what we

1827
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,800
wanted to see here which is why we're

1828
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,560
not buying here now if the market was

1829
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,140
already bearish on the lower time frame

1830
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,659
as we're running up here we're selling

1831
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:39,000
into that run higher

1832
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,460
but because we're anticipating reversal

1833
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,800
and we're not sure that the lower time

1834
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,620
frame autoflow is in alignment with r

1835
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,719
again it's not confirmed yet it's just

1836
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,060
anticipated with our anticipated Bears

1837
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,400
delivery we're not selling up here we're

1838
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,679
waiting for confirm nature displacement

1839
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:57,420
That's What I Call institutional

1840
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,679
sponsorship when you say lower time

1841
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,659
frame displays like this from our time

1842
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:02,400
from levels that's what causes Your

1843
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,040
sponsorship now on the

1844
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,380
one hour time per we can see that we've

1845
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,179
seen bearishness in price and obviously

1846
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:11,100
in the far time we can see there's very

1847
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,080
system products now we go into a 15

1848
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,760
minute timer and we're looking for

1849
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,699
levels where we can identify areas to

1850
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:19,080
sell from

1851
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,560
now here you can see inside this as soon

1852
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,600
as we shift structure lower

1853
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,340
below this look here

1854
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,739
we have a premium that's a fair value

1855
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,600
Gap remember what I talked about

1856
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,760
the only thing you should ever need is

1857
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,820
either fair value Gap Auto Block Breaker

1858
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,260
block that's all you don't need anything

1859
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,699
else

1860
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:40,620
okay so now if we have a favorite Gap

1861
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,780
here does it come over at the premium we

1862
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,120
have this week here that runs liquidity

1863
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,820
because this week runs liquidity we

1864
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,920
don't use this to measure our range

1865
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,620
inside our range measurements that start

1866
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,140
starts from this level here

1867
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,420
so our range measurement starts from

1868
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,239
here to here not from this one because

1869
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,820
this is a run unstop this is more like a

1870
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,640
gap on liquidity right so if we measure

1871
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,080
our range

1872
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,960
from all the way from the high all the

1873
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,420
way down to the low

1874
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:17,179
you can see it goes above our

1875
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,159
equilibrium which is premium again

1876
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,080
anything above equilibrium that's

1877
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,420
premium so we have a 15 minute

1878
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,300
inefficiency now watch it's not just

1879
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,300
only a 15 minute inefficiency

1880
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,540
also that's the discount low of that

1881
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,420
Weekly level there

1882
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,699
so we can sell short

1883
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:43,140
that inefficiency

1884
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,120
because it's our premium

1885
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,719
aiming for again what I talk about

1886
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:51,540
previously slow it's easy run on

1887
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,400
liquidity at the same time we can also

1888
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,980
see we have a short terminal here

1889
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,480
excuse me which clear the market could

1890
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,800
reach for

1891
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,420
so we could aim for below the slow here

1892
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,820
and then it previously is low

1893
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,500
and where do we place our stops in this

1894
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,520
example

1895
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,400
we've recently had a run on buy stops

1896
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,920
and this one here and on this shorts am

1897
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,500
I here so because we had a run on bicep

1898
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,380
here anyone who was buying here their an

1899
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,880
hour chart so we don't see the market

1900
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,860
run above the eye of this range first

1901
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,040
stop goes above here so we can use this

1902
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,800
again our stop is above the farewell Gap

1903
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,420
and also above the bearish auto block

1904
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,940
and also above the short-term high so

1905
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,460
that is two period areas above this one

1906
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,620
here what are the period areas other

1907
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,360
block and

1908
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,699
a rejection block right again a

1909
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:41,460
rejection box also a pediary two so

1910
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,380
autoblock rejection block ourselves goes

1911
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,300
above that and

1912
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,540
we're aiming for previously slow

1913
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,659
okay we're in it for appears this low

1914
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:53,520
and the market offers us that the moment

1915
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,840
we see the split again I want to talk

1916
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,940
about trade Management on the next video

1917
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,880
because this model or this video is just

1918
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,739
part one which discusses the model

1919
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,560
itself part two talks about management

1920
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,080
and everything like the other burning

1921
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,460
part of trading

1922
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,380
they can tell the market delivers and

1923
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,140
eventually I think around on the close

1924
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,480
it gets down into

1925
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,840
uh let's see

1926
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,960
gets down to our Target objective

1927
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,640
now let's get rid of this and let's see

1928
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,040
what happens on

1929
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,540
day two

1930
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,760
all right so that this is usually by the

1931
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,760
way last week Tuesday on pound that's

1932
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,040
what we saw

1933
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,560
and

1934
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,960
now going into Wednesday we've seen the

1935
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,900
market close below 50 of the

1936
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,640
inefficiency

1937
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,860
now that means that there's a very

1938
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,780
strong possibility that we trade into

1939
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,060
this as a Target internal liquidity

1940
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,159
there

1941
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,739
okay so now you can see how it's not one

1942
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:58,080
Java buys and data time frame it's just

1943
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,520
end there and that's just it that's just

1944
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,600
your bonus

1945
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,580
every single day you have to constantly

1946
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,440
confirm that the market is showing a

1947
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,060
willingness want to get down there the

1948
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,199
rock is not showing that Williams want

1949
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,300
to change with your daily program or

1950
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,159
your anticipated in the program then

1951
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,840
again I've mentioned before I thought

1952
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,120
the market is setting up manipulation or

1953
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,760
the market your bias is just wrong just

1954
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,679
wrong with price

1955
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,980
deliver program for uh Tuesday which is

1956
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,980
this one here this entry here

1957
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,100
is our standard reaccumulation program

1958
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,320
okay standard Recreation program here

1959
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,500
whereby we're trading a fair ball Gap

1960
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,140
Center recognition at premium or seven

1961
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,280
short there

1962
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,860
now again with the next day's trading

1963
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,440
we're not really concerned with what

1964
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,659
prices do it we have our key levels here

1965
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:48,840
which is this daily inefficiency then we

1966
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,540
have this daily inefficiency also here

1967
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,640
and we have the premise of that daily

1968
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,679
inefficiency

1969
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,679
discount low and consequent

1970
01:17:58,679 --> 01:17:59,880
encroachments we're going to identify

1971
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,960
Consular cultural here

1972
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,120
they will do the same thing again we're

1973
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,260
not really interested in what the market

1974
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,540
does until our time without opportunity

1975
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,699
and now our time Windows opportunity

1976
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:16,440
starts here

1977
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,040
here until here is what we're concerned

1978
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,880
with looking for or hunting our model

1979
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:29,060
so I'm gonna go back start from the time

1980
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,760
all right so you can see here

1981
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,280
heading into our

1982
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,380
session start we've already seen the

1983
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,880
spaceman lower

1984
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,500
um one thing I also failed to confirm

1985
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,840
here and which again I did not really

1986
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,140
bother with is the Run above the B9 open

1987
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,900
price and session open price I'm not

1988
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,940
going to do them in the examples here

1989
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,820
because this video is already

1990
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:02,940
1R 18 minute long 18 minutes long all

1991
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,320
right so I don't want this video to be

1992
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,760
too long

1993
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,380
um so I wanted to go and do this

1994
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,360
yourself just go on your chart look for

1995
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,280
a 12 family night New York 7 A.M

1996
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,280
midnight uh morning New York and draw

1997
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,920
them out and see how the market runs

1998
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,560
against those levels for expanding

1999
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,480
version of autofill

2000
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,420
and here really I'm not going to trade a

2001
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,920
day like this I'll talk about this on

2002
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,100
video too so when London is overextended

2003
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,659
so when I mean over extend I mean when

2004
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,120
London has expanding integration of our

2005
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,659
buys by hundreds of tips usually it's

2006
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,760
done it's daily range for the day and

2007
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,500
New York sessions low probability so

2008
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,140
I'll teach you when to filter out

2009
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,300
trading sessions like this okay there

2010
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,580
are very specific conditions for when

2011
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,920
not to trade during New York even though

2012
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,400
your daily bias is correct like maybe

2013
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,000
um

2014
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,500
if we see a lack of symmetry during

2015
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:59,400
London session or during like fomc NFP

2016
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,739
or when London sessions over extended

2017
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,260
during peers like this we don't trade

2018
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,360
New York sessions because that lowers

2019
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,219
the probability of continuation but now

2020
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:09,659
let's just see our price delivers for

2021
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:12,000
New York session all right so we see

2022
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,480
bear snazz and we see more bears instant

2023
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,820
primes but again does it really offer

2024
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,980
anything significant

2025
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,480
let's look at the range from the open

2026
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,440
price

2027
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,080
to the end of New York session about 26

2028
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,179
Pips and this is why I don't trade New

2029
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:29,699
York after I see over extension

2030
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,500
during London session I'm going to show

2031
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,900
you more examples on video too but this

2032
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,780
is already a long one or it is a long

2033
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,100
video

2034
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,600
all right so I'm gonna remove all of

2035
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,880
this and let's see how Wednesday this is

2036
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,080
what is available let's say our

2037
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,440
Wednesday's uh Kendall closed and

2038
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,800
continue to confirm that

2039
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,659
all right so now you can see on the

2040
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:55,080
Wednesday we traded for this level here

2041
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,360
we have this smaller differential Gap

2042
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,159
let's identify the small overall Gap

2043
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,080
here now it's very clear that the market

2044
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,260
streams with our buys right and the bias

2045
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,060
is looking for a bearish short-term

2046
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,340
retracement from this high extension

2047
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,080
level now what I wanted your attention

2048
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,620
to is look at how the market forms

2049
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,020
expansion around these key higher time

2050
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:19,500
from levels that's why they are key in

2051
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,980
terms of your price delivery now we have

2052
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,920
a smaller farewell Gap year

2053
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,260
look at how the low obviously candle

2054
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,960
forms inside our typing level and then

2055
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,820
we have a final Target objective here

2056
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:36,120
which is that Weekly block

2057
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,040
and now we can go into lower time frame

2058
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,739
and continue the scene profile

2059
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,120
and this is Thursday as far as action by

2060
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,219
the way I will identify our winner of

2061
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:51,000
opportunity which is this sign

2062
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,340
and

2063
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,540
this sign and we fast forward to those

2064
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:02,480
times oh no let's go back actually

2065
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,260
all right so now we're fast forwarding

2066
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,940
to those slimes and what you can see is

2067
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,179
obviously daily program is bearish for

2068
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,699
our program is bearish one hour program

2069
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:13,739
is fairs this is what we like to see all

2070
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:16,380
right now here we have to wait we're

2071
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,880
anticipating in the programs to bearish

2072
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,460
but in a situation like this and this is

2073
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,140
what usually happens when the market is

2074
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,179
about to make the high or low for the

2075
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:25,440
week and this is really important I want

2076
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,880
you to write Zion you know when the

2077
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,840
market is about to make the all your

2078
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,340
load for the week the market is will see

2079
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,980
a very extreme run against your intended

2080
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,060
buys into a higher time frame premium or

2081
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,020
a discount

2082
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,120
I like to see things like this because

2083
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,840
that sets the stage for the week we've

2084
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,540
seen a run lower and now getting into

2085
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,640
Thursday's price action

2086
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,920
we have everything all aligned we have

2087
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,380
the previous look here we have our

2088
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,420
weekly objective down here

2089
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,239
we have Source liquidity and what I like

2090
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:59,760
even more is you can see the high for

2091
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,140
the day which actually comes during

2092
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,920
Asian session forms around this old

2093
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,920
daily bullet Chevalier which now becomes

2094
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,360
an inversion level look at the

2095
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,100
consequent encryption of that level that

2096
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,080
has become an inversion level and that

2097
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,120
sourcing the I4 now if you go back to

2098
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,620
the checklist

2099
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,719
we want to see the higher love that they

2100
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,420
form around key daily or weekly levels

2101
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,659
that's what you see here

2102
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:29,340
Tuesday

2103
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,560
that's what I see here

2104
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,880
on Monday

2105
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,100
that's what we see here on the last two

2106
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,540
weeks Friday

2107
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,760
these Avatar repeating every single time

2108
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,620
it's repetitive

2109
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,719
that's why of this checklist you know

2110
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,179
that you have to follow through anyways

2111
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,460
let us continue with uh what we're

2112
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,880
seeing all right so now we have a 1R

2113
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,340
bearish autoblock

2114
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,320
there's a trade up into this parachute

2115
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,540
book here

2116
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,340
Okay so

2117
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:02,640
we actually have a 1R propulsion candle

2118
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,980
all right so we're very sure the block

2119
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,380
trades up there propulsion block we

2120
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:08,580
don't necessarily need to see the market

2121
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,900
straight up into this

2122
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,540
and then we have an old inefficiency so

2123
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,480
I have a smaller inefficiency within I

2124
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,699
know my choice are to get me a little

2125
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:18,600
bit

2126
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,480
so inside Let's uh

2127
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,900
this a little bit duh like this so

2128
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,400
inside this daily level we have a

2129
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,100
smelling inefficiency

2130
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,659
and I always go down to a lower time

2131
01:24:30,659 --> 01:24:34,320
frame on the 15 20 frame so we have a 1R

2132
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,780
inefficiency like this and we have what

2133
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,580
when our proportion was so we don't

2134
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,900
necessarily need to see the market trade

2135
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:43,140
up into the proportion block when do you

2136
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,060
not want to see the market trade up into

2137
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,320
a

2138
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,199
auto block so this is a form of a

2139
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,000
bearish of the block which is what we

2140
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,280
call propulsion block which forms after

2141
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,960
the market creates an autoblock And

2142
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,540
Trades up into that that's when you get

2143
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,580
a proportion candle usually with

2144
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:02,520
proportion candles the market sees very

2145
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,179
extreme displacement because it's in the

2146
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:08,040
name propulsion

2147
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,340
fast delivery now we don't necessarily

2148
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,080
need to see the market trade up into the

2149
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,179
propulsion candle because we have a

2150
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:17,760
balanced price range here so the balance

2151
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,320
fraction should act as a stiff

2152
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,420
resistance in price and not necessarily

2153
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,460
shared up into this

2154
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,920
now we'll go on a lower time frame

2155
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,440
um the same time frame unless all the

2156
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,560
market forms there we have a

2157
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,020
lower time frame bearish other block and

2158
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,020
a fair value Gap here now let's see the

2159
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,659
opening price for the session

2160
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:42,659
this is the session opening price what

2161
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:44,340
we like to see is we'll access the

2162
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,900
market Trader above the session opening

2163
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,739
price

2164
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:49,260
for our trade

2165
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,719
all right so you can go into lower time

2166
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:53,520
from here like a five minute time frame

2167
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,060
again our executions form around a five

2168
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:01,580
or 15 minute time frame

2169
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,139
and what you can see here is you can see

2170
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:07,139
the market is consolidating around that

2171
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:08,580
opening price

2172
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,800
and then

2173
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,020
you have a hot here

2174
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,460
we have a look actually this is open

2175
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:18,000
price you have uh here low here take

2176
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,400
your range from from the high all the

2177
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,659
way down to the low

2178
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,219
concentrate above

2179
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,860
50 yes it does

2180
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,320
again because this is going to act as a

2181
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,360
stiff resistance in price you don't want

2182
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,820
to see the market lose that bounce price

2183
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,020
range

2184
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,760
and guess what

2185
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,980
that balance project on the one hour

2186
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,159
time frame aligns with

2187
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,739
a five minute sell selling balance bison

2188
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:45,960
efficiency now what have I taught you

2189
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,500
with protocols using this is and CVS

2190
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,139
until the market runs an immediate your

2191
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,540
own liquidity which would be the

2192
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,480
previously is low here you do not want

2193
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,000
to see the market close above the

2194
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,560
consequent encroachment of that

2195
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,900
efficiency

2196
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,060
again cities and business are different

2197
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,219
from fair value gaps they are a former

2198
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:09,780
Fair volatile but they're different from

2199
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,159
regular free Valentines they have

2200
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,080
different cell protocols same way a

2201
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,460
bounce fraction has a different set of

2202
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,400
protocols with a fair Volga now with a

2203
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,739
classic fair bow Gap we can anticipate

2204
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:21,659
the entire range of that inefficiency

2205
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:23,639
getting filled and still seeing

2206
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,940
displacement but with CBS and buses and

2207
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,520
balanced price ranges the protocols are

2208
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,500
similar we don't like to see the market

2209
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,199
trade completely through the

2210
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:36,540
inefficiency until we run a level of

2211
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,880
immediate liquidity which is sales sell

2212
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,719
liquidity down here so we can trade

2213
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:44,580
this level here because it is at a

2214
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,860
premium with our stop

2215
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,659
again where do you want to stop to be

2216
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:50,520
above that

2217
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,860
we have a city number one rather

2218
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,659
farewell number so we have an auto block

2219
01:27:54,659 --> 01:27:56,940
number three so one two PD areas above

2220
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,920
our period area of execution that's our

2221
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,480
stock goes above

2222
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,679
and we're aiming foreign

2223
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,880
all the way down there to make money we

2224
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,860
can take some partials off here but we

2225
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,260
can leave a portion on for this target

2226
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,120
objective and look at what

2227
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,300
let's see what the market does and we

2228
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,340
get the expansion and here supporters

2229
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,380
come off here the old sick parts I'll

2230
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,719
talk about partials on video so there's

2231
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,820
actually supposed to be two videos

2232
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:35,280
and then finally I don't know what

2233
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,159
happens next uh but again consider more

2234
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,560
the first session and if you took all

2235
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,300
your profits

2236
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,820
excuse me blow that low down there

2237
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:49,139
that is an easy to almost three to one

2238
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:51,239
versus reward I think the market

2239
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:52,920
eventually drops out there during

2240
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,380
monitors which it does I'll teach this

2241
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,199
I'll teach profit taking using time and

2242
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,960
price on video two so I'm going to write

2243
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,880
this down my notes in terms of things to

2244
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,760
talk about on video two videos is going

2245
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,340
to be a lesson on modular thinking and

2246
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:12,239
psychology and on lesson two we're gonna

2247
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,060
talk about profit taking

2248
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,360
okay we're gonna talk about

2249
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,120
low probability conditions conditions

2250
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,159
that will reduce the probability of your

2251
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:26,460
trig and means you don't execute in

2252
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,900
those kind of conditions

2253
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,139
we're also going to talk about

2254
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:31,739
um

2255
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:33,840
stop placements

2256
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,639
all right so

2257
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:39,780
this this video took me four hours to

2258
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,420
prepare and around almost two hours to

2259
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,699
record it's one hour 30 minutes right

2260
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:47,760
now so far to prepare 1R 10 minutes

2261
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,500
record so I hope I really really hope

2262
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,199
this video changes everything for you in

2263
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:56,460
