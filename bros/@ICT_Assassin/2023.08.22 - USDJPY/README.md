=================================================================================  
what do we also notice ??? 

After closing above a old monthly FVG

Close above old PD arrays = Violation of the PD ARRAY

Meaning it violated it, after closing above it we should expect price to respect it on the opposite end.

=================================================================================  


=================================================================================  
After taking external range liquidity, we would need a market structure shift on the 4H timeframe.

We have not got a clear market structure shift with displacement & closes below.

So we have no confirmation it will tap into this weekly FVG yet.

=================================================================================  
After tapping into the weekly FVG (if we do)

I would wait on a market structure shift to the upside on the 4H timeframe.

Once that occurs, we would look for buys into the MONTHLY DOL

=================================================================================  
Until then we are patient, im not bearish, I will wait for all my timeframes to line up before even thinking about executing.

For the highest probable trades possible.

Have a great week trading ü´∂üèΩ
