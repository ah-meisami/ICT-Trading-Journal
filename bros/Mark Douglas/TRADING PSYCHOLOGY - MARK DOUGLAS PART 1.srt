00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,120
hello my name is Mark Douglas and I'm

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,799
the author of the discipline trader and

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,319
trading in the zone I've been a trading

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,620
coach since 1982 and over the years I've

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,880
worked with some of the industry's

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,009
biggest hedge fund and money managers as

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,289
well as some of the exchanges largest

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,869
floor traders I know that all of you

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,640
want to experience consistent results in

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,119
your trading

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,160
in other words you want to be able to

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,010
generate an income you can rely on

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,529
however one of the major obstacles and

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,570
trying to accomplish this objective is

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,480
the area of trade execution to produce a

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,070
consistent income a trader has to be

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,870
able to execute their trades without

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,510
making any errors or mistakes in other

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,910
words trading without hesitation

20
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,610
reservation or internal conflict

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,960
basically all of the errors we are

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,090
susceptible to a result of a lack of

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,149
confidence or more specifically trading

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,940
with fear well most people don't realize

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,739
is that trade without fear was actually

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,559
a learn a training skill a skill that

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,870
has to be cultivated and it's very

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,789
different it separates the professional

29
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,729
from the typical trader in this series

30
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,799
of DVDs I'm going to provide you with

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,780

specific mental techniques you'll need

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,820

like the professional you can move in

and ease that will allow you to take

the same time I want you guys to help me

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,729
a little bit okay it might take me a

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,110
little bit you know might take me a

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,879
little bit to get going because I'm not

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,620
used to doing presentations that you

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,870
know 6:30 in the morning my time or semi

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,780
for morning my time but anyway what

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,970
we're gonna do is we're gonna we're

57
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,239
gonna go through the process learning

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,090
how to think like a professional trainer

59
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,379
why would we want to learn how to think

60
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,720
like a professional anybody got any

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,239
ideas that make some money but you don't

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,799
have to think professional to make money

63
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,700
do you what does it even imply what does

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,889
it imply to to think like a professional

65
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,630
trader I mean let me ask you this how

66
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,549
many you guys have I don't know what

67
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:48,840
your what your trading experience have

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,310
been in terms of the number of years

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,500
you've been at it or you kind of give me

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,959
an idea of the demographics here of the

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,250
audience I mean how many people have

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,310
been trading for more two or three years

73
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,000
most everybody then then less than less

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,269
than two years kind of new people no

75
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,660
okay so we've got about half and half

76
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,900
what would it mean to guys to say well

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,370
let's think like a professional trainer

78
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,569
what's that

79
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,519
not thinking like an amateur ok that's

80
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,560
good but what are the implications of

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,430
the difference between a professional

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,959
and amatuer consistency there you go you

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,180
see you're at least a workshop right hey

84
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,419
consistency exactly in other words what

85
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,329
what that would imply is that is that if

86
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,980
I don't know if I'm a professional

87
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,989
trader and other words if I've aspired

88
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,700
to be a professional

89
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,849
it one of the implications would be that

90
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,950
that I can make consistent money because

91
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,470
if I'm trading in the mode of a

92
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,269
professional I could be a hedge fund

93
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,640
manager you know a professional edger

94
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,250
working for trading companies or just

95
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,069
having a full time job as a trader where

96
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,250
my income my sole income is derived as a

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,130
trader and be in that kind of a position

98
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,510
in order to be in a position where other

99
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,180
people are going to give you their money

100
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,470
or or give you their assets to be able

101
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,080
to you know make money for them it would

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,169
certainly imply that you can make

103
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,860
consistent money that there's a way for

104
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,320
you to let's say create an equity curve

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,030
that looks you know something like this

106
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,060
is that right

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,900
are you gonna give your money to

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,910
somebody with an equity curve that looks

109
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,270
like that I'm not saying that people

110
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,350
don't do it and I'm not saying that it

111
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,389
doesn't happen but I'm saying that if

112
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,110
I've aspired to be a professional trader

113
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,639
it means I must have learned something

114
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,200
that's different than the people who

115
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,820
can't do this there must be something

116
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,650
about about the way that I approach

117
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,490
training that allows me to do that and

118
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,270
believe me there is there's a lot but

119
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,919
that yeah basically and I don't know if

120
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,220
how many people in the room have have

121
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,080
either read trading on his own or the

122
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,930
disciplined trader got a few people so

123
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,660
so probably there so there's actually

124
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,740
most the people in the group by familiar

125
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,180
maybe even with me or my background at

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,330
all true or not yes or no see no right

127
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,289
okay so I'm gonna just give you a little

128
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,260
bit I'll give you more later on but I

129
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,020
started talking back 1978

130
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,670
and the first trade that I made I the

131
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,020
first trade I made was in potato

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,790
features at the Chicago Mercantile

133
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,620
Exchange which they don't even trade

134
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,750
potato futures anymore why pick potato

135
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,020
futures I have no idea I think that's

136
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,730
probably what my broker said I should be

137
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,310
trading maybe he said there was there

138
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,900
was an opportunity and potato futures in

139
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,150
any way I made money and of course you

140
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,580
know and just like most people who make

141
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,260
money there the first trade or the

142
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,050
second trade it's it's about as easy as

143
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,300
one could imagine and therefore you

144
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,850
think yourself oh my god why didn't I

145
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,690
learn about this a long time ago it

146
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,860
sounded I mean that sounds kind of

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,330
familiar right in terms of the thought

148
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,110
process and I went from trading potatoes

149
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,100
to trading gold to trading silver and my

150
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,680
I'd say my trading experience back then

151
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,110
was probably typical even to what it is

152
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,970
today with most people although you have

153
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,370
to keep in mind that the technology that

154
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,530
we had back then wasn't anything

155
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,790
anything like what you have available to

156
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,730
you right now today it still boggles my

157
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,330
mind when I think about the way we had

158
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,180
to trade 25 years ago almost 30 years

159
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,130
ago compared to what's available right

160
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,520
now I mean I've never I've always been

161
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,140
attracted more to trading commodities

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,640
than stocks as a matter of fact I've

163
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,020
never even traded stocks I'm always

164
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,390
traded commodities and options and and

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,430
it's just and I've never really never

166
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,680
really had the desire to Train on the

167
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,440
floor the exchange although I lived in

168
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,730
Chicago for 20 years it just it never

169
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,470
really appealed to me I don't know how

170
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,790
many people are familiar with the floor

171
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,680
or the or the or the trading pits but I

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,270
just thought it was an extremely harsh

173
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,520
environment and and not something that

174
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,260
you know not something that just like I

175
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,430
said it appealed to me but the kind of

176
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,560
trading platforms that you guys have

177
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,290
available to you today really truly

178
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,570
approximate what it would be like they

179
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,000
have a seat at the Chicago Board of

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,810
Trade or Chicago Mercantile Exchange and

181
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,370
and to trade at that level you have

182
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,780
instantaneous execution a

183
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,270
and it's like you can and you like you

184
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,860
can change your mind and not feel

185
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,440
humiliated or or or like you know

186
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,730
there's something wrong with you you put

187
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,130
in an order you can cancel it back you

188
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,170
know before before the advent of

189
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,270
electronic trading platforms we used to

190
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,890
have to call a broker now you think

191
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,630
about the time you made a decision to

192
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,370
put on a trade you think about the time

193
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,290
that it takes one to dial the phone for

194
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,480
someone to pick the phone up you know

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,309
how many times it has to ring and then

196
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,840
he gets on the other end of the line you

197
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,640
know you got your broker and then you

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
give your broker your order and then

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,219
you've got to deal with the fact that

200
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,840
does your book really approve of your

201
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,490
order in other words my good of anybody

202
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,080
proof is that we'll see I'm you know I

203
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
want to buy you know I want to buy three

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,190
gold contracts I said well you know some

205
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,600
of my biggest biggest customers are they

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,780
they just went short gold no not what

207
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,220
you gonna do with that information okay

208
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,440
or I've got you know X number of guys

209
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,610
that are that are on the other side of

210
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,110
that trade say well yeah if you want you

211
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,130
know what take the other side of their

212
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,420
trade I mean that's fine finally off

213
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,790
with the order in so it's like you know

214
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,580
so he could put the order in and then

215
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,900
you know you've got to wait for it you

216
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,270
got away for a fill I can't tell you how

217
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,830
many times that I put orders in the

218
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,900
market where they were limit orders

219
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,100
because they'd want to do a market order

220
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,750
as I didn't want to get the slippage of

221
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,640
a market order so you do a limit order

222
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
in and I'll limp it order market has to

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,020
change to guarantee guarantee to fill

224
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,339
the market has trade through your price

225
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,920
doesn't not how many times has the

226
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,620
market traded to your price okay just

227
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,589
write to your price if a buy order and

228
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,700
reversed and you didn't get built that's

229
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,650
very possible the problem when you're

230
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,200
doing it with a with a broker over the

231
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,750
phone is that is that that order goes

232
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,210
into the pit it goes to an executing

233
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,730
executing broker in the pit itself so

234
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,760
you've got a runner and and and and and

235
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
then the order got to go back to the

236
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
runner back to the farm bank back to the

237
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,660
broker and the broker calls you with a

238
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,790
fill you're talking several minutes now

239
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,440
what if you're in a situation in a fast

240
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
market where the market actually hit

241
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,550
your price you may have gotten filled

242
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,950
but you really don't know you don't want

243
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,540
to put a stop in the market because you

244
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,570
don't even know you're in or not and

245
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,770
Marcus screaming let's say even in your

246
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,750
favor and you'd like to take profits but

247
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,510
you still haven't got a fill back yet

248
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,910
you don't know if you're in the market

249
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,080
this is the kind of stuff we had to deal

250
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,430
with all the time

251
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,860
all the time it was a completely

252
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,810
different world not only that the only

253
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,490
information that we had available to us

254
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,670
was open high low and close that was it

255
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,330
open high low and close bars and we used

256
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,950
to have to get those unless we talk to

257
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,690
our broker and pestered them you know X

258
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,339
number of times a day you know if you

259
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,399
get it through the wall street journal'

260
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,060
used to have to keep our own daily

261
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,580
charts intraday stuff was just like

262
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,010
non-existent so so anyway I you know

263
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,680
that's I I started trading like that I

264
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,040
went through well I don't even remember

265
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
what my first trading account was I

266
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,149
think I was around $20,000 you know I

267
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,220
lost all of that and then you know saved

268
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,750
up some money and opened up another one

269
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,390
for around 15 you know lost all of that

270
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,730
and then we went to another broker and

271
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,810
I'm thinking this guy doesn't know what

272
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,130
he's doing and I'll find somebody who

273
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,430
does

274
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,290
and and then this is this is what really

275
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,690
really this is probably the reason I

276
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,029
mean standing here today was this

277
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,920
particular trade because because this

278
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
particular trade just it had a profound

279
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,060
impact on me in terms of in terms of how

280
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,010
it changed my life and what I was

281
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,080
willing to do to find out what this was

282
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,839
all about to find out really what does

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,400
it take to be a consistently successful

284
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,130
trader what does it take to really be

285
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,589
able to earn an income as a trader I was

286
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:58,240
I was long silver this would have been

287
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,380
back in right around 1980 or 1981 1980 I

288
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,700
think I was long silver at around 975 an

289
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,690
ounce and there was to 5,000 ounce

290
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,270
contracts at the Comex in other words I

291
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,400
was long ten thousand ounces of silver

292
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,570
at 975 an ounce and right after I got

293
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,670
into the market the market dropped about

294
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,860
20 cents on me to about 955 so I was

295
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,220
down $2,000 and my broker said well okay

296
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,810
you know here's what we're gonna do

297
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,650
instead of getting out

298
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,420
well-well we'll put you into a spread

299
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,330
and so what we'll do is we'll you're

300
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,640
long ten thousand ounces of silver in

301
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,430
New York will go short ten thousand

302
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,110
ounces of silver in Chicago because you

303
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,370
could trade Chicago silver at the

304
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,350
Chicago Board of Trade everybody with me

305
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,760
on this does want to make sure that you

306
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,410
guys are all with you know even though I

307
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,510
know many of your stock traders it's the

308
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,380
concept is the same okay so I'm long

309
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,380
10,000 and 975 he puts me short 10,000

310
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,720
at 9:55 in Chicago so I've got this

311
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,940
spread going on and then he said well

312
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,380
when the market goes back in your favor

313
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,970
we'll just take the short leg of the

314
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,210
spread off now keep in mind back then

315
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,279
you guys are you guys are what do you

316
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,230
typically pay for commissions even in

317
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,060
commodities or even I don't know what

318
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,160
you pay for stocks but but typically the

319
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,510
average Commission is about four to five

320
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,180
dollars around turn right that's what we

321
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,339
would expect to pay no what are you

322
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:31,300
paying less more round turn wow really

323
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,350
well you're in the Dow mitt you're in

324
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,400
the Dow Minnie what do you pay for the

325
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:42,620
Dow domini a lemon okay well anyway then

326
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,880
eleven okay well back then back in the

327
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,589
80s we were how much you think we were

328
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,950
paying back then come on give me guess

329
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,150
come on yeah

330
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,560
what yeah 125 about house 125 around

331
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
turn per contract so in other words we

332
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,220
to put this trade on cost me 250 bucks

333
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,959
okay when he put this one on right here

334
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,660
it cost me another 250 bucks and then he

335
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,220
said of course that when the market goes

336
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,500
back into my favor he'll take the short

337
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,820
leg of the spread off and you know I

338
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,470
should be all right so that's exactly

339
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,970
what the market did the market went back

340
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,520
up to you know right around the 975 area

341
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,290
he took the short leg of the spread off

342
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,120
and then the market immediately dropped

343
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,709
back down another 20 cents and put the

344
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,000
shirt this is a short leg of the spread

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,339
back on again so that's another 250

346
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,070
bucks okay plus he just locked in when

347
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,320
he took this off first of all he locked

348
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,360
in a 2,000 dollar loss by putting this

349
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,310
trade on when the market went back up to

350
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,650
975 and he took this off he locked in

351
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,959
another $2,000 loss and then when I went

352
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,329
back down again he put it put it back on

353
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,220
and locked in another $2,000 loss

354
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,620
now I'm down six thousand seven hundred

355
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,010
and fifty dollars okay and then of

356
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,720
course it happened two or three more

357
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,390
times now from from from the markets

358
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,640
perspective all I'm in all the markets

359
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,960
the silver markets just in a trading

360
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,370
range that's all it is I say it's just

361
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,610
in a trading range but but I don't

362
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,110
really I didn't know how to read chart

363
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,610
math chart patterns at the time it

364
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,050
didn't really understand what was going

365
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,550
on I was just listening to him

366
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,580
and so what he was doing is just taking

367
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,900
advantage of the fact that his going

368
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,280
back and forth between support and

369
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,740
resistance and and generating

370
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,860
commissions for himself okay that's that

371
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,480
was it that's that's basically he was

372
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,360
just he was just turning my account but

373
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
that's that's not the story okay that's

374
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,600
that's happened to a lot of people of

375
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,340
course it happens less now because we're

376
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,710
all responsible for the trades that we

377
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,390
put on all we have to do is click the

378
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,070
mouse button and it's not that much

379
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,130
money but here's here's the story is

380
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,880
that as these losses are as these losses

381
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,340
are mounting okay and I can't I can't

382
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,710
sleep and and and getting real stressed

383
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,470
out you know I I wake up one morning I

384
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,970
thought you know what this is it I just

385
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,620
can't take this anymore I just I just

386
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,550
can't take it

387
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,230
and so you know when I got to work I

388
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,100
called them and I said you know what

389
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,630
just get out of the whole damn thing I

390
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,300
just can't do this so just liquidate the

391
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,600
position does anybody remember the hunt

392
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:18,620
brother silver debacle it didn't there's

393
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,750
any but if I say the word limit up does

394
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,280
anybody understand what I mean by that

395
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,020
okay the exchanges will impose

396
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,170
artificial price limits of how much a

397
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,300
commodity or even stock for that matter

398
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,430
can fluctuate in any given day before

399
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,310
they stop trading so we don't have the

400
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,720
cut we don't have these kinds of moves

401
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,600
too much anymore but back in the 80s

402
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,790
limit moves were really quite common

403
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,740
they really were in other words what

404
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,660
would happen is this is that is that if

405
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,610
the market if the market went up let's

406
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,140
say I think in silver was 50 cents I

407
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,430
don't remember exactly what it was but

408
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,070
if the market went up by 50 cents they

409
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,990
would actually stop trading meaning if

410
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,940
the market was bid up to let's say in

411
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,460
this case ten dollars and 25 cents

412
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,750
trading would stop

413
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,760
in essence what that what this means is

414
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,109
that is that is that at 10:25 there were

415
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,640
no people there wasn't anybody in the

416
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,000
world

417
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,859
it wasn't Mikey but this is important

418
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,959
for later on there wasn't one person in

419
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,400
the world who was willing to sell silver

420
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,089
at 10:25 if it was a limit move

421
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,550
not one person and so what happens is

422
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,579
that the market the price will go up

423
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,260
seeking to find who will actually sell

424
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,140
so what and but what they but what the

425
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,030
exchanges didn't want his exchanges

426
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,620
didn't want there to be this is huge

427
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,480
fluctuation all in one day there might

428
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,420
have been sellers at 10:26 or there

429
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,710
might have been seller is that 11

430
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,480
dollars but you don't know that because

431
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,710
the exchange says we're gonna stop

432
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,890
trading at 10:25 you guys with me on

433
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,340
this okay so what happened is that I

434
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
don't think it happened more than maybe

435
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,350
a half an hour 45 minutes after I got

436
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,180
out the mark was trading right around

437
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,750
975 an ounce where silver went limit up

438
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,920
and went limit up was 30 days in a row

439
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,030
249 dollars an ounce to 49 dollars an

440
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,300
ounce

441
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,020
I was looking now now kita now thinking

442
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,130
I'll think about this okay now think

443
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,570
about being in this kind of a winning

444
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,250
trade now when we're in a winning trade

445
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,200
the market almost never go straight up

446
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
and it never go straight down there are

447
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,770
rare occasions of course like in this

448
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,930
case and when it does so that we're when

449
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,550
we're in a winning trade we have to

450
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,410
constantly be making decisions about

451
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,960
where we're gonna take profits and how

452
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,850
much heat we can take with the market

453
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,590
coming back against our position to say

454
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,690
well is this the time to take profits or

455
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,740
am I going to let it come back a little

456
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,700
bit further we're gonna come back a

457
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,630
little bit further against me because

458
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,370
well this is the nor is this normal

459
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,470
retracement or is this more significant

460
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,240
okay is this a little bit of a profit

461
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,830
taking retrace or the more significant I

462
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,110
get out now do we have more or left are

463
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,090
we gonna make new highs you got to be

464
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,650
making all these kinds of decisions and

465
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,220
it's very difficult as we all know right

466
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,750
see in this case I didn't have to be

467
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,090
making any decisions because the market

468
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,720
went limit up 30 days in a row boom boom

469
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,000
it was like wait go in I was out I just

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,380
got out like a half an hour before it

471
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,120
happened only the problem is I couldn't

472
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,060
even get back in because there wasn't

473
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,410
anybody willing to take the other side

474
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,870
of the buy orders on a limit move you

475
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,330
can't get back in so I sat back and

476
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,040
watched in a complete agony I mean yeah

477
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,190
I mean intense intense agony I'm not a

478
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,930
nice throw up but do you know it's like

479
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,190
maybe I almost did I don't know go ahead

480
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,230
you said you had five contracts no to to

481
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,730
just let you just take one off the table

482
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,700
that the other one run for another day

483
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,780
first of all Jerry you're you're

484
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,160
assuming that I knew that this was gonna

485
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,740
happen no I'm assuming that getting out

486
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,900
all at once takes you off takes you out

487
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,000
of the play completely Jerry have you

488
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
ever been in a situation we really lost

489
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,360
a ton of money and you just can't deal

490
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,370
with it anymore yeah I know I have

491
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,960
situation where I've been down a lot of

492
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,790
money I didn't lose because that's on

493
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,210
paper

494
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,640
no well commodities no with stocks

495
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,260
you're right with stocks it's

496
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,450
technically on paper with when you're

497
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,220
when you're in commodity is the money is

498
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,200
out of your account it's gone it's gone

499
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,290
at the end of the day okay it's not this

500
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,560
is not paper money this is real money

501
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,460
are you with me on that I am

502
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,790
understanding you okay so so so I wasn't

503
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,120
looking at at I wasn't looking at at you

504
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,870
know and like I said paper losses the

505
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,560
money was out of my account so I had had

506
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,210
enough I couldn't I couldn't take it

507
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,370
anymore so when you when you think about

508
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,280
it in that context when you just made up

509
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,750
your mind that I just can't deal with

510
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,610
this anymore it doesn't even occur to

511
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,530
you to get out in stages why would I get

512
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,630
out in stages when I when I've already

513
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,280
gone through a week and a half of this

514
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,400
back and forth and you know and it's

515
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,400
virtually wiped out my account because

516
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,630
by then I probably would have had to put

517
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,280
more money even for me to take just one

518
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,110
contract I'll leave one on I probably

519
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,430
would have had to put more money in the

520
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,590
account and I'm not there's what any

521
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,960
point in doing that but are you with me

522
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,850
on this idea I don't trade commodities

523
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,340
that's right other things in but the

524
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,360
concepts of

525
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,430
except it doesn't come out of my it's as

526
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,960
you said it's a paper trail yeah you

527
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,610
already all is who you won't stock you

528
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,590
on an asset and if you want to hold on

529
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,210
to that asset until it goes down to zero

530
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,880
that's fine okay your money is not

531
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,280
flowing in a sense money's flowing out

532
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,290
of your account but not in the same way

533
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,120
it is whether it a commodity yeah okay I

534
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,490
have to pay that money right now you're

535
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,170
just losing the value of an asset I

536
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,080
actually have to pay that money and it

537
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,530
comes out every single day go ahead and

538
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,550
go in to hand the microphone back to

539
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,590
that gentleman

540
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,780
another thing that can be of interest

541
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,480
here is at least from way I gathered you

542
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
was talking a while ago you really

543
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,010
weren't controlling this your broker was

544
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,770
doing the correct so even if you had

545
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,810
wanted to get out in stages your broker

546
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,330
was doing it saying hey here's what I'm

547
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,600
doing to you yeah pretty much yeah it's

548
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,950
like I didn't really I wasn't really in

549
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,120
control of the situation because they

550
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,630
didn't know what I was doing all I know

551
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,490
is that I was within let's say a half an

552
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,250
hour 45 minutes of just a monster trade

553
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,020
a monster trade yeah and like I said I

554
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,210
sat back and watched an agony as a

555
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,770
market went up to 49 dollars an ounce

556
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,050
I'm thinking myself I was like that

557
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,660
close to $400,000 on just two contracts

558
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,180
four hundred thousand dollars it's so

559
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,890
like I said when I first started telling

560
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,300
you this this really had a profound

561
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,460
impact on me it really did and I thought

562
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,800
to myself and at the time I was managing

563
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,020
a commercial casualty insurance agency

564
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,480
in the suburbs of Detroit not really you

565
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,710
know I thought that's what I wanted to

566
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,000
do I didn't really know what I want her

567
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
to do but you know I aspired to to

568
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,130
management I was very successful and you

569
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,200
know for at the time you know even back

570
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,350
then in you know the late 70s early 80s

571
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,660
what was making a six-figure income and

572
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,810
I was only in my early 30s so you know

573
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,280
it was I really had a lot of things

574
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,190
going for me but in you know after this

575
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,540
experience I thought to myself you know

576
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,920
and I got to figure out what's going on

577
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,020
here and I certainly wasn't going to be

578
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,580
able to do it in Michigan so I thought

579
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,140
you know what I'm going to Chicago

580
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,750
and that's what I did I went to Chicago

581
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,490
the first thing just thought you know

582
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,680
well if I'm gonna get into the business

583
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,420
Who am I gonna get into the business

584
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,670
with well back then there was Merrill

585
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,770
Lynch there's Dean Witter Smith Barney

586
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,750
you know and I thought were you gonna

587
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,460
who you gonna pick you pick Merrill

588
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,590
Lynch right okay so I went over the

589
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,910
Chicago Board of Trade they have an

590
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,890
office right there and right on the

591
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,090
second floor of the Chicago Board of

592
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,390
Trade

593
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,720
and they just so happened they had three

594
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,320
openings for trainee brokers and they

595
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,810
had over a thousand people applying for

596
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,870
it so how am I gonna how am I going to

597
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,960
be one of those three people I thought

598
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,090
well you know what I went back you know

599
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,520
I went back home I went to you know one

600
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,780
of the one of the bigger Merrill Lynch

601
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,820
offices in the Detroit area and I went

602
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,020
through the whole employment plan

603
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,000
employment process to fill new your eyes

604
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,890
myself with what it is that they

605
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,980
acquired to get a job and and and this

606
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,110
is what I think got me that job at the

607
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,910
Board of Trade is that they had an

608
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,100
aptitude test and there's a multi-page

609
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,080
application but on the back of the

610
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,920
application they had a they had a square

611
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,900
like this on you know and and they

612
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,150
wanted spontaneously while you're in the

613
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,170
you know while you're filling this

614
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,510
application out spontaneously what they

615
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,640
wanted you to do was to write like a

616
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,620
little mini essay about some

617
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,810
philosophical question before I went to

618
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,340
the Board of Trade and actually filled

619
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,430
out that application I spent two weeks

620
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,960
agonizing over every word we just to

621
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,300
make sure every word of that two or

622
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,680
three paragraphs that I wrote down was

623
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,840
completely perfect so that when I took

624
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,820
the hat I wrote down exactly what I'd

625
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,980
worked on and and I can imagine why they

626
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,000
hired me because if he thought that I

627
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
wrote that spontaneously in the moment

628
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,440
but hey this guy we got to have this guy

629
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,630
here we got to have this guy okay so I

630
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,970
did I got the job now think about this

631
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,580
now when I was working for the agency

632
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,440
the casualty agents commercial casualty

633
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,900
insurance I was as a matter of fact I

634
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,420
just signed a contract not more than

635
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,560
like three or four months before I

636
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,390
actually went to the went to work in

637
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,840
Chicago over a three-year period for

638
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,190
$360,000 and what Merrill Lynch was

639
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,180
offering me was $20,000 on a draw okay

640
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,950
in other words it was it was a you know

641
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,720
they're going to give you 20,000 but

642
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,220
it's a draw me and I got to pay a back

643
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,549
pay

644
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,379
not commissions now though if you can

645
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:51,119
imagine there wasn't one person in my

646
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,369
life not one person who thought that I

647
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:56,369
wasn't absolutely stark raving out of my

648
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:59,970
mind to give that up to go to Chicago to

649
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,840
do this so you know wasn't like I had a

650
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,149
lot of support you know and I wasn't

651
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,769
like I wasn't catching a lot of grief

652
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,389
from everybody that I knew about what it

653
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:12,360
was that it that I was doing so you can

654
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,869
imagine my horror you might as a good

655
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:18,239
word for it I mean because when I got to

656
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,859
Chicago I'm thinking why am I even doing

657
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,690
this I'm doing this because I'm going to

658
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,580
Chicago because because that's where the

659
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,320
traders are that's that's where the

660
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,059
people are who know who know what

661
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,220
they're doing

662
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,619
correct and then to get there to find

663
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,499
out that that is not the case that is

664
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:39,330
not the case at all that the brother

665
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,489
were 40 almost 50 brokers in the office

666
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:45,960
and none of them knew how to trade not

667
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,279
only did they not know how to trade I

668
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,080
mean they'd Merrill Lynch made

669
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,909
absolutely no bones about the fact that

670
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,700
we were not traders they spent no money

671
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,600
no time and completely discouraged us

672
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,909
from even learning how to trade we were

673
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,659
salesmen we were taught how to talk

674
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,929
about training we were taught how to

675
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,809
talk about investments we were taught

676
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:12,090
how to you know it's called dialing for

677
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,649
dollars to get on the phone and get

678
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,109
people to open up accounts and and the

679
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:20,519
and even though this was unspoken I'd

680
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,649
say the the underlying philosophy behind

681
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,480
the business was especially in the

682
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,859
commodity business I'm not talking about

683
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,809
the equities I'm not saying that that on

684
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,129
the equity side of the business that

685
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,480
there was that it wasn't more reputable

686
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,759
but but this was about as your reputable

687
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,350
as it could be because the underlying

688
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,659
philosophy that we operated from was all

689
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:41,669
commodity traders are terminal meaning

690
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:43,259
like they have a terminal illness it's

691
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:44,850
only a matter of time before then when I

692
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,070
say all commodity traders are terminal

693
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,820
and it is our job as a broker to make

694
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,320
them as comfortable as possible until

695
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,889
they expire

696
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,720
in other words to extract as much money

697
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,850
out of their account as you could until

698
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,720
they're gone and and and and even to

699
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,110
this day even to this day it just blows

700
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,390
me away to think that when I went I went

701
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,730
to a 30-day training class in Manhattan

702
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,130
and there were brokers from all over the

703
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,350
world probably about in 80 or 90 of us

704
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,290
and and the guy and and the person that

705
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,160
was the head of Merrill Lynch

706
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,540
commodities at the time his name was

707
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,730
John con Heaney and when he came in to

708
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,880
address our class and to this day I

709
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,830
don't know why he did this but he like

710
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,390
you said hi he started out and he

711
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,890
started out with these words the average

712
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,450
Merrill Lynch customer loses all their

713
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,390
money in six months and that was the

714
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,010
truth and commodities not equities

715
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,320
commodities and that was the truth that

716
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,760
was about what it was that's it took

717
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,500
about six months for people to lose

718
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,410
their account and and and you just like

719
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,410
I say just go to the next one so here

720
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,590
I'm I left this six-figure income to go

721
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,650
to Chicago to learn about this business

722
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,510
in this industry and here I'm in a

723
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,590
situation and it's like it was I guess

724
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,290
it was appalling absolutely appalling so

725
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,200
I thought well okay I'll make friends

726
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,550
with people on the floor they must know

727
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,130
what they're doing the floor traders the

728
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,410
floor traders know what they're doing

729
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,910
well I found out that wasn't necessarily

730
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,830
the case either now it doesn't mean that

731
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,020
the floor traders didn't know how to

732
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,330
make money but what this is and I'm not

733
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,440
going to get into this because we don't

734
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,980
have time but even though what you do is

735
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,460
called trading and what they do they

736
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,020
call trading the way in the mindset that

737
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,450
you have to have to make money couldn't

738
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,650
be further apart

739
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,460
even though they're both called trading

740
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,070
the typical local what I mean the person

741
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,080
who traded for their own account in the

742
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,590
pit or in the floor of the exchange the

743
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,510
way they made money almost they didn't

744
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,620
they didn't weren't trying to make

745
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,110
Direction related decisions in other

746
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,340
words it wasn't the kind of trading

747
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,230
where they actually they would find

748
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,790
themselves in winning trades that were

749
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,200
going in their favor but that's not the

750
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,420
reason why they put the trade on and

751
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,560
like I said I'm not going to get into

752
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,420
the specifics of dynamics of

753
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,770
does it take me too long to explain it

754
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,870
just doesn't necessary for right now all

755
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,180
I'm saying is that is that it just it's

756
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,920
it's a completely as a matter of fact

757
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,610
before I left Chicago and moved to to

758
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,850
Arizona I the Chicago Mercantile

759
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,490
Exchange asked me and I and I worked out

760
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,380
for all for a while for about six months

761
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,330
before I left asked me to put together a

762
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,430
program to help floor traders make the

763
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,790
transition from the floor to screen base

764
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,920
trading because it's very it's it's a

765
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,690
huge psychological leap it really is

766
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,580
it's a huge transition that that that

767
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,280
has to be made so what I'm saying is

768
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,280
that not knowing that before I got to

769
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,990
Chicago it was like here I'm in a

770
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,870
situation where where I really didn't

771
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,950
know anybody who really knew how to

772
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,360
trade or at least knew how to trade in

773
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,820
the sense of creating that consistency

774
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,800
that we're looking for it doesn't mean

775
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,870
that people couldn't make money people

776
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,760
are making money all the time it's just

777
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,320
that you know what's the point of making

778
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,590
money if you're you're susceptible to

779
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,880
giving it all back and all those if this

780
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,590
is your equity curve and all of a sudden

781
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,930
you're you're you're experiencing these

782
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,380
huge losses and huge drawdowns

783
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,570
not only is this certainly damaging

784
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,450
financially but it's also damaging

785
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,300
emotionally and it can be very difficult

786
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,670
to recover from these are what I call

787
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,760
the boom and Buster's okay you basically

788
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,140
had traders that fall into three

789
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,750
categories as far as equity curve is

790
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,050
concerned you've got your consistent

791
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:43,800
winners the people who have the traders

792
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,840
you've got your consistent winners now

793
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,070
that doesn't know it doesn't mean that

794
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,980
there aren't draw downs here okay but

795
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,240
what do you think these draw downs would

796
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,549
be a reflection of for the consistent

797
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:02,980
winners consistent winners take losing

798
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,760
trades all the time but their draw downs

799
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,529
are a reflection of what anybody got any

800
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,110
ideas yeah money manage money management

801
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,620
skills capital preservation okay these

802
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,350
are okay these are two good answers but

803
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,059
not the answer I'm looking for their

804
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,779
draw downs are simply a reflection of

805
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,179
the normal losses that any trading

806
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:34,149
methodology will incur there are there

807
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:36,159
is such a thing as normal

808
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,140
losses you don't have to write this down

809
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,419
because I'm just we're just starting to

810
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,830
scratch a certain we are going to go

811
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,419
into this and far more detail later on

812
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,399
so I mean if you guys want to write it

813
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:46,750
down that's fine but it really isn't

814
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,600
necessary okay normal losses that any

815
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,789
trading methodology will incur then

816
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:00,250
you've got people who who have who

817
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,549
learned something about how to trade who

818
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,159
acquire a good methodology where it is

819
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,940
possible based on that methodology to

820
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,140
experience consistent a consistent

821
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,830
income but your equity curve might look

822
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,440
more like this

823
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,740
most people who are experienced the

824
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,720
boom-and-bust cycles use the bus cycles

825
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,760
would say that something happened in the

826
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,700
market to cause this

827
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,929
what you're going to find out today is

828
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,559
that it is not the case even though it

829
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,659
may seem like it it is not the case

830
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,539
these are virtually always the result of

831
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,820
trading errors what I call trading

832
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,830
errors which we're going to go into in

833
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:04,649
detail later on one of the Oh just just

834
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:07,710
a I just for the gentleman the people a

835
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,089
few people back here that don't have any

836
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,399
idea of my background I'm gonna go a

837
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,050
little bit further in it and and just

838
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,580
I'm just gonna jump ahead for a second I

839
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,219
ended up ended up being a trading coach

840
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,369
and and working with I was trading coach

841
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:22,109
from probably about 17 years I don't

842
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,080
really do it do it much anymore I just

843
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,418
pretty much focus on my own trading but

844
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:30,119
but while I was especially in the you

845
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,219
know throughout the the eighties and and

846
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,030
most of the 90s I worked with a lot of

847
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,050
floor traders and wonderful I would talk

848
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,960
about boom and bust there there was one

849
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,250
of the floor traders I work with was

850
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,980
probably one of the five biggest bond

851
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,290
traders at the Chicago Board of Trade

852
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,429
and when I met him was in like around

853
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:58,200
May of 1992 and from January of 92 until

854
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,390
the time that I met him in May of 1992

855
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,910
he had her on this is key this is a guy

856
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,349
that just traded for himself he didn't

857
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,150
trade for a firm he just traded his own

858
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,160
account on the floor of the Chicago

859
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,349
Board of Trade in the bond pit he had 12

860
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:11,820
million dollars rolled in and out of his

861
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,010
account he had a particularly bad day

862
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,950
and he ran into somebody who attended

863
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,240
one of my workshops and say hey you

864
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,190
should go see this guy he called me we

865
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,050
had a few appointments didn't really go

866
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,780
anywhere and the next thing about a

867
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,640
month later I get a frantic call from

868
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,099
his wife who I hadn't even met didn't

869
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,170
even know who she was got a frantic call

870
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,670
from his wife that said you know they're

871
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,490
gonna lose her house if you know if if I

872
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,230
don't do something with him okay

873
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,260
he had had a particularly had another

874
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,990
bad real bad day so anyway I started

875
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,470
working with him in July of 1992 and

876
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,990
from July of 1992 until the end of the

877
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,089
year he ended up the year with with

878
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,980
almost six thousand six million dollars

879
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,559
now that may not seem like a lot

880
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,839
considering he had these swings but he'd

881
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,819
never finished he'd never finished a

882
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:04,160
year with more than I think around 700

883
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,740
650 or 700 thousand dollars so he had

884
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,410
just under six million dollars and so

885
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,900
then he went on vacation he happened to

886
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,700
take a book with him called the coming

887
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,500
collapse of the bond market and this

888
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,809
would have been in like December over

889
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,690
late December of 1992 early January of

890
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,200
93 and came back now if anybody

891
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,970
remembers the bond market back then it

892
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,970
rallied to rally to spectacular Heights

893
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,010
but in the meantime he'd read this to

894
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,869
come and collapse of the bond market so

895
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,339
he was going into the market every day

896
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:37,700
short ok and and pissing away the six

897
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,079
million dollars until he got to the

898
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,349
point where he had about two of it left

899
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:44,260
and and took him about I don't know

900
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,650
until maybe mid-february and and he was

901
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,730
so exasperated that he said hey you know

902
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,680
what I'm willing to do anything

903
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,710
okay now keeping my I'm willing to do

904
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,619
anything and he wasn't it wasn't lip

905
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,589
service it was real it was genuine it

906
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,290
was sincere and I said if you're willing

907
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,059
to do anything then here's what you have

908
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,450
to do what I've been working with him

909
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,400
what I noticed is that he was able to

910
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,069
stay focused really for not more than

911
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,650
about an hour a day now this guy loved

912
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,599
trading I mean he just loved being in

913
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,849
the pit he just loved every part of it

914
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,559
he just he just had the hardest time

915
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,160
tearing himself away but if you really

916
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,369
wanted to make consistent money then I I

917
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,440
felt that an hour a day was about it

918
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,630
because after an hour a day he started

919
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,450
losing his focus would start to diminish

920
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,559
and then he'd also start to get reckless

921
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,809
he was the kind of guy in this in this

922
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,420
here again this even kind of this is

923
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,980
very difficult for people to comprehend

924
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,740
but it was the absolute truth he he was

925
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,390
the kind of guy where when I was working

926
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,119
with him during

927
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,700
period you know in in in second half of

928
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,589
1992 where he would have a he'd have a

929
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,049
1/2 million dollar day winnings he'd

930
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:03,869
make a half million dollars but when he

931
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,609
called after he was out of the pit to

932
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:08,220
have his consultation you know he'd be

933
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,099
real angry with himself because he up

934
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,480
till about five minutes before the

935
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,190
clothes he was up a half a million

936
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,079
dollars and then he then he pissed away

937
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,559
about 175 of it so we really end up with

938
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,210
$325,000 for the day now this is just

939
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,160
like a normal guy like like us here in

940
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,680
this room with three hundred and twenty

941
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,829
five thousand dollars and this was not

942
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:31,230
an abnormal day but he's real angry with

943
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,999
himself because he pissed away that

944
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,430
hundred seventy five and then the next

945
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,019
day you know he'd do about the same

946
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,269
thing he'd make four hundred and and and

947
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,430
piss away maybe two at the close and

948
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,009
then the next day he'd make you know 350

949
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:47,309
and then piss away another 150 he's got

950
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,710
spectacular winds up until Friday but

951
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,499
this accumulated angry anger that that

952
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,450
he was building up throughout the week

953
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,130
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday by

954
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,829
five time Friday rolled around you know

955
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,119
he'd lose a million and a half bucks and

956
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,140
then start to cycle all over again so

957
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,960
this so now it's like I'm saying you

958
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,999
know what especially as a floor trader

959
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,579
as a floor trader you really have to be

960
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,619
focused when you're trading at the level

961
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,269
that he traded at when you're trading

962
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:23,160
hundreds of sometimes thousands of

963
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,259
contracts if anybody knows anything

964
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:26,910
about the bond market we know that that

965
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,640
that one incremental price change in a

966
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,839
bond contract is thirty one dollars and

967
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:34,440
25 cents

968
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,019
okay you guys with me on this so this

969
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,789
would be a tick so in other words if the

970
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:41,430
bonds went went one one tick up and

971
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,190
you're long one contract you'd make

972
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,660
thirty one dollars and twenty five cents

973
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,819
if it went down one tick and you were

974
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:52,609
long one contract you just lost 30 $1.25

975
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:55,259
he would trade a thousand contracts at a

976
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,430
time that means one incremental tick

977
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,720
priced range was $31,000

978
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,839
31200 fifty bucks now if anybody's ever

979
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,599
watched the bonds move you know that it

980
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,230
can move 5 10 15 ticks like that not

981
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,790
only that there can be what's called

982
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,589
price of vacuums everybody are familiar

983
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:20,690
with a price vacuum you know what I mean

984
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,809
by price vacuum it means that if the

985
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:26,980
bond is if the bonds are at let's say

986
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,339
106 106 10 you guys are probably not

987
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,950
familiar with bond prices 106 10 that

988
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,339
was the last posted price that something

989
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:40,760
can happen and you're long something can

990
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,339
happen where there are there are no more

991
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:48,260
offers and the next posted price is 106

992
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,410
even that means the market went down 10

993
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,760
ticks without there being any trades

994
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,109
between 10 and even no trades at all

995
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:59,420
which means if you're long you just lost

996
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,790
in that instant 31,000 dollars and 25

997
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,250
cents on a thousand contracts this is

998
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:10,790
quite common so you really have to be

999
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,160
focused it would be like when you're

1000
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,559
trading at this level I would I would

1001
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,960
make an analogy it's almost like there's

1002
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,020
a couple of analogies one it's like if

1003
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,369
you're in an NBA playoff if the finals

1004
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,549
it's the last game seven games it's all

1005
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:33,140
it's seven game NBA Finals one minute

1006
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,500
left

1007
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,319
the score is tied the coach is going to

1008
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,230
send somebody in who's really focused if

1009
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,760
the coach thinks you're distracted and

1010
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,130
you're not on your game you think you're

1011
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,859
going to get in that game this is the

1012
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,720
way you to be in these kind of

1013
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,790
circumstances in the pit that's the kind

1014
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,440
of mindset that you had to maintain

1015
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,960
because even if you got you just even if

1016
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,819
you were if you were distracted and

1017
00:41:58,819 --> 00:41:59,690
turned away

1018
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,579
there could be bids and offers that

1019
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,140
would have gotten you out of your trade

1020
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,880
that all of a sudden dry up meaning when

1021
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,440
guys are bidding an offering in the pit

1022
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,270
they're using hand signals and there's

1023
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,680
and they're telling you they want a

1024
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,700
buyer they want to sell and how many and

1025
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,960
there's there's a hundreds of guys all

1026
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,600
around screaming now these bids are off

1027
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,980
can dry up because when you have make

1028
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,260
eye contact any point you say okay we've

1029
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,910
got a trade and then you write your

1030
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,530
trade down in a trading car turn Alison

1031
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,170
electronic handheld handheld device but

1032
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,510
otherwise you make a trade and then you

1033
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,620
could be out of your trade and take your

1034
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,410
profits when these kind of things happen

1035
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,080
these price vacuums you know your you

1036
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,190
could be in bad shape and just be a

1037
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,930
matter of just just a momentary you look

1038
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,240
away the guy that you were gonna use to

1039
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,040
get out of your trade is gone now he put

1040
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,660
his hands down oh I'm in I'm in trouble

1041
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,770
well what I found is that is that he

1042
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,760
could maintain his an ideal mindset for

1043
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,480
about an hour a day and so that's why I

1044
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,820
said if you're really sincere you if

1045
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,320
you're really you really want to do you

1046
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,270
can really do anything you can only

1047
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,000
train an hour a day and he agreed to it

1048
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,830
and he said what hour a day I said

1049
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,540
doesn't it really won't matter and it

1050
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,220
really didn't he was convinced initially

1051
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,020
that what hour he went in would make a

1052
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,310
big difference it really didn't make any

1053
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,030
difference at all

1054
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,310
he was so good as a matter of fact there

1055
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,810
were other bond traders that I work with

1056
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,240
that said that watching him trade would

1057
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,230
have been the equivalent of like

1058
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,420
watching Michael Jordan play basketball

1059
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,420
he was that good and so he did he went

1060
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,880
in just one hour a day and because he

1061
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,340
knew that he only had that one hour he

1062
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,770
was really focused and he was averaging

1063
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,410
a hundred and seventy-five thousand

1064
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,110
dollars for that one day or for that on

1065
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,030
an average for that one hour per day

1066
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,030
okay but that would be an example he

1067
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,770
would be an example of an extreme boom

1068
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,560
and Buster there kind of gonna kind of

1069
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,970
have that concept down the brain about

1070
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,890
boom and Buster's okay and then what you

1071
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,850
have is you have the consistent losers

1072
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,810
people whose equity curve looks like

1073
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:14,270
that now just to get back to my

1074
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,270
situation when I when I like I said when

1075
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,000
I went to Chicago I'm thinking okay you

1076
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,030
know I mean I've got quite a bit of

1077
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,360
money I sold my interest in the agency

1078
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,860
but at the same time I had a

1079
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,440
pretty expensive lifestyle as you can

1080
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,990
quite imagine I had a house in Michigan

1081
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,110
that I had a girlfriend a very

1082
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,850
high-maintenance girlfriend and and and

1083
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,220
who to her to her two daughters were

1084
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,680
living in and I had a very expensive

1085
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,660
apartment in Chicago and a portion the

1086
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,180
you know I just I had the life okay and

1087
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,280
and you know I was I was going back and

1088
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,790
forth every weekend to visit them so I'm

1089
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,850
really my situation was I really I

1090
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,250
couldn't maintain that kind of lifestyle

1091
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,710
with the money that I had without making

1092
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,040
without being successful as a trader and

1093
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,780
that was a whole IDN e way i thought you

1094
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,970
know okay I'll I'll make whatever

1095
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,900
shortfall that you know I end up with as

1096
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,420
a trader and interestingly enough I had

1097
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,490
to have my trading account with another

1098
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,330
brokerage firm secretly I couldn't train

1099
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,390
through Merrill Lynch and there wasn't

1100
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,430
anybody else in the office who traded

1101
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,500
their own money I was the only unless

1102
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,790
they were doing a secretly didn't tell

1103
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,290
me I was the only person in the office

1104
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,800
who was actually trading their own money

1105
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,630
who actually traded period other than

1106
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,250
putting on trades for their customers so

1107
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,300
what ended up happening is that and

1108
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,670
although part of this is that is that I

1109
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:55,250
also had this I just I don't know I

1110
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,070
can't really tell you why I knew this

1111
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,170
just that I did I just it just made

1112
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,090
sense to me it just never occurred to me

1113
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,890
that trading was anything other than

1114
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,820
about psychology I mean the first

1115
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,280
trading book I ever bought was was

1116
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,380
actually the very first book on trading

1117
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,390
the only the first book that was devoted

1118
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,050
it's a specifically trading psychology

1119
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,760
which was Jake Bernstein's investors

1120
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,780
quotient that came out in 1980 and there

1121
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,160
were that many trading books of a leavin

1122
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,050
available back then and that was the

1123
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,250
first trading book that I didn't buy a

1124
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,750
book on technical analysis I bought a

1125
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,990
book on trading psychology so I was I

1126
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,820
was not only

1127
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,700
immersed in the concepts of trading

1128
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,740
psychology virtually right from the very

1129
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,420
beginning I was also keeping very

1130
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,510
extensive journals of my thinking

1131
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,090
process what was going on what I was

1132
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,480
observing from other brokers in the you

1133
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,030
know in the Merrill Lynch office as well

1134
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,850
as what I was observing from interacting

1135
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,270
with my customers and I noticed we were

1136
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,220
all kind of all kind of you know

1137
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,670
conforming to the same patterns the same

1138
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:09,350
problems but just say that because I did

1139
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,150
have you know I did have this kind of

1140
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,270
foundation you know to understand that

1141
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,430
that it was basically psychological in

1142
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,660
nature because one of the things we're

1143
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,490
going to talk about you and I get into

1144
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,650
the skills section of this of the

1145
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,200
presentation is that when you look at

1146
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,560
trading skills it's like what kind of

1147
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,090
skills are we talking about we're

1148
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,140
talking about thinking like a

1149
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,600
professional we're applying that the

1150
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,400
skills are all mental in nature and they

1151
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,860
are because when you really get right

1152
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,120
down to it you really start to think

1153
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,010
about it what physical skills are

1154
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,090
necessary to trade but we're not talking

1155
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,880
about a golf swing or a tennis racket or

1156
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,530
any other kind of you know any other

1157
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,270
kind of physical endeavor that that

1158
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,210
we're that we're familiar with what kind

1159
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:54,770
of skills we what does it take

1160
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:00,050
physically to put on a trade the

1161
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,840
mouse-click that's it your ability to

1162
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,520
move the mouse and to click it on the

1163
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,730
buyer cell button it's that simple and

1164
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,380
as a result of it being that simple it's

1165
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,420
easy to think that oh my god trading is

1166
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,280
so easy it isn't as you will probably

1167
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,440
know whether you've been added a long

1168
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,900
time or even a little bit of time there

1169
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,360
are some very sophisticated

1170
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,790
psychological skills that you have to

1171
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,860
acquire to get this kind of an equity

1172
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,320
curve and and virtually all these skills

1173
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,920
are founded in learning how to trade

1174
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,440
without fear that's basically what this

1175
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,530
whole workshops about is learning how to

1176
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,090
trade without fear

1177
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,799
because that's what's gonna screw you up

1178
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,750
on virtually everything everything that

1179
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,819
you can do wrong as a traitor is going

1180
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,200
to be the result of what you're afraid

1181
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,500
of and the effects that fear has on your

1182
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:14,410
perception of market information so so

1183
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:20,079
with my situation it's like here I'm

1184
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,380
given all this up to go to Chicago to

1185
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,530
learn how to trade to find out that the

1186
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,359
only people who really knew how to trade

1187
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:31,809
back then were were people that I didn't

1188
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:34,299
have access to meaning there were there

1189
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:36,069
were you know there were some big names

1190
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:39,609
in the industry who never really took

1191
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,400
the time or expended the effort to find

1192
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,160
out exactly what it is that allowed them

1193
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,980
to create a consistently rousing equity

1194
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,549
curve what they would say is well yeah

1195
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:53,289
you got to go with the flow the trend is

1196
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,299
your friend cut your losses let your

1197
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:58,150
profits run you know as all these all

1198
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,890
these neat little phrases but it's like

1199
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,450
who and I hell knew what that meant and

1200
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,809
how to do it yeah it sounds great cut

1201
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:07,450
your losses let your profits run huh you

1202
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,450
know even cutting your losses it can be

1203
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,190
extremely difficult to learn letting

1204
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,900
your profits run can be 10 times more

1205
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,369
difficult than learning how to cut your

1206
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:21,190
profit cut cut your losses fact is one

1207
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,750
of the most difficult things to to

1208
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,160
acquire in terms of a skill is learning

1209
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,589
how to let your profits run so it was

1210
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:31,000
like all this was kind of building up

1211
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,779
and my lifestyle was was draining it was

1212
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:39,490
draining my money away and one of the

1213
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,619
things that one of the things that that

1214
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:45,240
I would say characterized me back then

1215
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,579
if I was probably obsessive about

1216
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,890
anything it was my credit it's like my

1217
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,720
credit was my as far as I was concerned

1218
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,700
it was like the most important thing in

1219
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,299
life is to have flawless flawless credit

1220
00:50:58,299 --> 00:51:02,529
not just I mean flawless and here I'm in

1221
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:05,440
a situation where I'm I am truly running

1222
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,710
out of money

1223
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,510
and my trading losses I didn't really it

1224
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,370
wasn't really like I was losing a lot of

1225
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,170
money trading because I'd really stopped

1226
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,760
the hemorrhaging I wasn't trading in a

1227
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,140
way where I was actually losing money

1228
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:22,300
but I wasn't making any money and it's

1229
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,710
like there was always this little voice

1230
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,990
in the back of my brain you know coming

1231
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,340
to the forefront of my consciousness and

1232
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,620
I would say you know mark this ain't

1233
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,590
adding up there's something wrong here

1234
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,040
there's something there's something

1235
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,730
wrong it's like it's not it's not adding

1236
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,070
up and then I kind of shove it back

1237
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,840
there and you know I'm like yeah it's

1238
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,550
gonna be all right I'll figure it out

1239
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:43,810
I'll figure it out it's gonna be all

1240
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,840
right

1241
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,460
eventually got to the point where I I

1242
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,000
was literally out of money and the only

1243
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,170
choice I had was to file bankruptcy

1244
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,940
fortunately I was in a situation where I

1245
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,570
had two residences one in Chicago in one

1246
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,820
in Michigan and so I had a choice of

1247
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,440
where I filed and of course I filed in

1248
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,630
Michigan because if Merrill Lynch would

1249
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,560
have found out they probably would have

1250
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,150
fired me

1251
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,620
it's a matter of fact nobody knew what

1252
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,390
had happened ie nobody knew in Chicago

1253
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,850
buddy that I knew in Chicago knew what

1254
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,360
had happened

1255
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,400
so I filed in Michigan and I'm thinking

1256
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,260
and literally because of my attitudes

1257
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,600
about credit I'm thinking if I've got to

1258
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,910
do this I'm going to fall beneath the

1259
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,760
cracks of society and never really

1260
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,590
believe that I honestly God really did I

1261
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,090
just didn't see how it's possible to

1262
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,030
live after having have to after having

1263
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,170
to do something like that and of course

1264
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,690
you know what I found is that in when I

1265
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,100
ended up I mean what I say in the

1266
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,420
discipline trader and I don't really go

1267
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,560
into a lot of detail on the disciplined

1268
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,090
trader about this but just just to say

1269
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,710
that what I ended up with was relaying I

1270
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,930
had an apartment I had my bed in my TV

1271
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,470
and and and and when I when I filed I

1272
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,480
was still current on everything I was

1273
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,210
even late one day on any my bills as a

1274
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,250
matter of fact I even I even called you

1275
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,400
know called the the finance company to

1276
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,930
come and pick the car up but I was even

1277
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,130
late a payment I said you know what I

1278
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,960
can't do it anymore you're probably

1279
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,540
gonna want it back anyway so you know it

1280
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,700
was like come and pick it up and of

1281
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,330
course they did and and the guys went

1282
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,350
there's a funny story about that I

1283
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,420
remember told anybody this but you guys

1284
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,190
want to hear funny story about that

1285
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,670
when the guy came to pick it up and so

1286
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,369
I'm thinking you know because we were in

1287
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:28,990
front of the apartment building and and

1288
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,039
I'm thinking well if he's gonna pick

1289
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,049
this up you know then I ought to get

1290
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:33,519
some sort of receipt that it was in

1291
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,740
perfect condition you know because I

1292
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,789
don't know what the hell is gonna do to

1293
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:39,730
it I'm you know yeah you mean I don't

1294
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,829
know so it's like any guy wouldn't give

1295
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:44,049
me a receipt saying that and so I

1296
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:46,299
wouldn't give him the keys and so you

1297
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:48,670
know so we called his boss and and I and

1298
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,710
I heard I heard his boss on the other

1299
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,029
end Alliance screaming at him get those

1300
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:56,950
keys you know it's like yeah he said

1301
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,240
something else I'm not gonna say yeah

1302
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,279
for this brother for this you know for

1303
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,140
this particular presentation but yeah I

1304
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,180
was like you know they just you know

1305
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,829
someone someone's willing to give you

1306
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:06,849
the car or they don't even have to go

1307
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:08,200
repossess it that's like you know hey

1308
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,759
give him the receipt but in any case

1309
00:54:11,759 --> 00:54:14,019
what I realized I mean don't you think

1310
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,700
about this it's like it's like when you

1311
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,680
define yourself based on your

1312
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,140
possessions you know just like anybody

1313
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,970
that loses anything you know you've got

1314
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,470
you've got an internal representation

1315
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,000
and you've got an external

1316
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,549
representation and now there was there

1317
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:30,400
was a discrepancy between what was

1318
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,960
outside I mean what was inside of me in

1319
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,930
terms of the way that I defined myself

1320
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,089
and you know so that has to be

1321
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:39,730
reconciled and what I realized you know

1322
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,019
in a dad didn't even really take that

1323
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:42,309
long I don't remember how long it took

1324
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,109
but it was like one I still had my job

1325
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:47,710
at Merrill Lynch and so as a result I

1326
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,150
mean it's like I'm starting thinking

1327
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,319
okay well things are gonna be all right

1328
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,210
I was in my worst fear I mean that was

1329
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,650
my worst fear I mean with it with the

1330
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,180
fear would creep up into the forefront

1331
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,490
of my mind I was like you know that was

1332
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,950
my worst fear now I'm in it and I'm

1333
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,630
realizing that you know I think I'm

1334
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,819
gonna be alright I'm healthy I can still

1335
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:05,799
think I'm gonna I'm gonna be alright and

1336
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:08,109
when I came to this realization that I'm

1337
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:10,809
gonna be alright this is when things

1338
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,779
change for me as a traitor and and this

1339
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,400
is and this is the interesting part

1340
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,430
about my situation that that most people

1341
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,140
don't have the benefit of experiencing

1342
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,289
there are two things one I had this

1343
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,970
foundation of knowing that it was all

1344
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,670
psychological anyway so I had all these

1345
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,230
things that I that I'd been working on

1346
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,049
up to that point and to when you tap out

1347
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:32,740
as a traitor

1348
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,319
I mean when you

1349
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,239
really tap out you don't get to trade

1350
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,140
anymore cuz you don't have any money

1351
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,949
right but I was in a situation where I

1352
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,410
still got to trade even though I was

1353
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,849
working with other people's money I

1354
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:48,140
still got to trade every day and so as a

1355
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,289
result of experiencing my worst fears

1356
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,390
coming to the realization that I'm gonna

1357
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,519
be alright and then at the same time

1358
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,890
being being in a position where I'm able

1359
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,249
to interact with the market it was like

1360
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:03,259
because I didn't have anything more to

1361
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:07,670
lose I didn't it was like it was like

1362
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,069
this the market completely changed for

1363
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:13,519
me it was like I had these blinders on

1364
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:15,499
that all of a sudden just came off

1365
00:56:15,499 --> 00:56:18,319
because the market was different because

1366
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,920
I wasn't afraid anymore I was seeing the

1367
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,049
same patterns over and over and over

1368
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,019
again beforehand but I was seeing the

1369
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:30,619
same patterns differently I was seeing

1370
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:33,109
the same patterns from a let's say

1371
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:35,979
relatively carefree state of mind and

1372
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,440
that relatively carefree state of mind

1373
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,459
allowed me to like say flow in and out

1374
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:45,859
of my trades with an ease and

1375
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:48,049
effortlessness that I would not have

1376
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:57,289
been able to imagine beforehand and then

1377
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,699
what happened is that I started making

1378
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:02,709
consistent money for my customers and

1379
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:08,299
there's even well there's one one really

1380
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,619
was a matter of what one really good

1381
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:11,509
good story where I mean there are a lot

1382
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:12,920
of good stories that I can tell you

1383
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,509
about my customers at Merrill Lynch but

1384
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:17,599
in one case I inherited this guy who was

1385
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,269
at the time was a head of the state of

1386
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:22,849
Illinois mainframe computers and he was

1387
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:25,249
from India and he had put together his

1388
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:26,930
own trading program and he was using the

1389
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,390
you know state computers to do it and so

1390
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,150
and he had an account technically an

1391
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,410
account with Merrill Lynch but it wasn't

1392
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,999
funded because he had lost all his money

1393
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:37,130
but he but he still had he still

1394
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,869
maintained the account and so I

1395
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:40,609
inherited him as a customer and he would

1396
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:42,440
call me every day and he was just like

1397
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,880
and all he would say to me was like I

1398
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,589
pick up the phone he wouldn't say hi how

1399
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:46,039
are you

1400
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:46,560
here's a

1401
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,150
give me data you know like give me the

1402
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,100
high low and close there and you know so

1403
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,420
we interacted like this for a long time

1404
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,310
well he came up with his own day trading

1405
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:57,480
system that that that eventually well

1406
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,710
because he and I started working on it

1407
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,390
together he had the he had the internal

1408
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,040
program for it but he didn't have any

1409
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,410
money management parameters for it so I

1410
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,730
have about two or three months of

1411
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,900
working with him on it we came up with

1412
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,710
some really good money management

1413
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,780
parameters and then all my customers

1414
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,460
started trading it and and we were

1415
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,670
making consistent money day after day

1416
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,630
even to the point where Merrill Lynch

1417
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,370
will starting to take notice you know

1418
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,200
that that you know here we all hold this

1419
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,730
whole customer because his customer

1420
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,160
bases is making money and and he got to

1421
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,740
the point where where he's thinking okay

1422
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,320
all these people are now deriving this

1423
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,350
benefit from my work I should be able to

1424
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:33,750
do it too and he talked his wife into

1425
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,490
letting him put five thousand dollars

1426
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,250
into his account to fund his account now

1427
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,870
I don't know what happened to him why I

1428
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,400
mean I you know we've not like we had

1429
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,290
personal discussion so I don't know why

1430
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,570
he didn't have any money in his account

1431
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,830
the guy was a maniac

1432
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,290
it is like he got he put the money put

1433
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,580
the money in his account and two days

1434
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,800
later was all gone it was like he called

1435
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,450
me up and say okay do this I said well

1436
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,900
wait a second the system says to do this

1437
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,780
no no no no no they don't care what the

1438
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,980
system says this is what's going to

1439
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,980
happen he didn't follow any of his own

1440
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,310
rules

1441
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,400
now here we had a track record we had a

1442
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,030
legitimate track record bonafide real

1443
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:22,410
money day after day he gets a few bucks

1444
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,030
in his account and it's like he thinks

1445
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:28,710
he knows where the markets going like I

1446
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,630
said he was gone in two days and that

1447
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,010
was it it was all over with because at

1448
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:35,040
that point he you know he was done I

1449
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,320
didn't get the system because it wasn't

1450
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,090
in his computer mainframe computer at

1451
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,070
the state of Illinois and and had no

1452
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,960
more contact with him and shortly after

1453
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,280
that ended up getting fired from Merrill

1454
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,600
Lynch anyway because there was a like

1455
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,130
one of these management consultants that

1456
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,290
came in from New York and she was going

1457
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,600
around the office talking all the

1458
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,100
different brokers because of one or

1459
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,450
whatever whatever was that they were

1460
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,410
trying to find out

1461
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,320
and she got to me and at that by that

1462
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,730
time I was already writing the

1463
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,700
disciplined trader and so and I just

1464
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,560
like you know I started very exciting to

1465
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,360
say hell yeah this is what I found out

1466
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,040
this is what I've learned and her eyes

1467
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,200
lit up saying this is exactly this is

1468
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,790
exactly what we're looking for and she

1469
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,890
was just we talked for probably about an

1470
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,690
hour hour and a half and you she was all

1471
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,030
excited and then she and then said I you

1472
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,980
know I got to go tell you I don't say

1473
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,400
his name

1474
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,620
the office manager okay and she walked

1475
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,150
away from me walked over the office

1476
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:27,750
manager

1477
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,720
ten minutes later ten minutes later he

1478
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,100
came over said pack up your stuff and

1479
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:36,450
get out right then and there right then

1480
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,520
and there on the spot pack up your stuff

1481
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:47,000
and get out so that's how I ended up

1482
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,440
ended up actually being a trading coach

1483
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,330
because by then just you know floor

1484
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,350
trade because I'd made friends with

1485
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,730
floor traders you know I was making

1486
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,050
friends to find out how they trade that

1487
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,400
sort of thing well they started coming

1488
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,080
to me for advice even while I was at

1489
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,870
Merrill Lynch and and because it's a

1490
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,600
pretty small community you know the word

1491
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,460
gets around especially when when you you

1492
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,130
know people are really genuinely help

1493
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,320
with with the kind of advice that you're

1494
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,120
getting that you're giving them and I'd

1495
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,130
you know and I'd help several for

1496
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,660
traders turn their training around and

1497
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,880
so what had happened is I started

1498
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,600
getting hired by clearing firms what I

1499
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,340
mean by clearing firms that to trade on

1500
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,980
the floor of an exchange you have to you

1501
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,390
have to clear your trades through a

1502
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,970
financial institution and so you know

1503
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,190
it's like you're it's these are traders

1504
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,210
just like you they have their own

1505
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,250
account but but what they have to do is

1506
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,420
they have to clear their trades through

1507
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,250
like I said one of the one of the major

1508
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,710
clearing firms at the exchange well what

1509
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,120
had happened what would happen is this

1510
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,310
that it isn't like this now but back in

1511
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,990
the back in the early 80s through the

1512
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,180
mid 80s clearing firms were in some ways

1513
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,190
like like almost like family operations

1514
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,590
where where the people who owned the

1515
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,600
clearing firms they knew all the all the

1516
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,070
floor traders they were friends with

1517
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,900
them they partied together you know

1518
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,730
Christmases and holidays and that sort

1519
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,590
of thing and so if one of the floor

1520
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,320
traders would go debit we know what I

1521
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,120
mean by go debit in other words you know

1522
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,230
you have to trade it have to have a

1523
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,490
positive

1524
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,350
positive balance in your account well

1525
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,150
the problem with floor trading is that

1526
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:18,420
not again not today but back then when

1527
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,100
you trade it on the floor you had to had

1528
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,810
to record your trades on a trading card

1529
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,760
so in other words of you and I are

1530
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,500
entering into a trade where I'm going

1531
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,180
along and you're going short what I

1532
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,460
would do is is that we would we would

1533
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,890
take our badge like the acronym of our

1534
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,440
badge and and our Clearing House number

1535
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,570
recorded on this card and how many

1536
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,460
contracts we traded you let's say you're

1537
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,200
short 10 and I'm long 10 and when the

1538
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,180
price that that that we trade in a map

1539
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,800
well those cards didn't have to be

1540
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,690
turned in until the end of the day and

1541
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:48,480
then they'd all get reconciled meaning

1542
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,800
that between all the different trades

1543
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,600
and all the all the traders well the

1544
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,100
different clearing firms this will all

1545
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,780
go into a central clearing operation to

1546
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,210
find out which trades were you know to

1547
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,010
find out whose long and whose short how

1548
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,360
much money's coming out of whose account

1549
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,010
and whether or not they were caught what

1550
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,810
are called out trades meaning that you

1551
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,810
thought you thought I said 10 and and I

1552
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,160
thought we were doing it for a hundred

1553
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,320
ok so now we've got a discrepancy in 90

1554
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,300
trades these were called out trades it

1555
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,280
had to be reconciled before the open of

1556
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,869
the next day which is a whole nother

1557
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:17,160
world now we're not in Gilmer now you're

1558
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,930
not gonna get into it all but all I'm

1559
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,970
saying is that all I'm saying is that is

1560
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:24,840
that it would not be unusual for guys to

1561
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,730
over trade during the day in the

1562
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,170
clearing firm wouldn't even find out

1563
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,930
about it until the end of the day for

1564
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,670
example one of them one of the guys I

1565
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,980
worked with at Merrill Lynch eventually

1566
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,350
he was a mathematics professor a really

1567
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,880
nice guy should not have been a trader

1568
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,510
at all had absolutely I mean anyway more

1569
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,950
than peas at the Chicago Mercantile

1570
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,080
Exchange and he was a one lot trader

1571
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,670
meaning you know just traded one

1572
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,160
contract one in and out one contract and

1573
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,010
and and eventually the forces inside of

1574
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,050
him building up where he's frustrated

1575
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,220
with the fact that he's you know I can't

1576
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,050
make a living at it and he's just eating

1577
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,910
and eating it out where one day he

1578
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,940
snapped and this and this one lot trader

1579
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,550
almost took down the clearing firm in

1580
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,680
other words he's got like several

1581
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,220
thousand snps on several thousand

1582
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,770
contracts where other guys are into

1583
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,440
those trades and and the markets going

1584
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,980
against them so he almost took down a

1585
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,740
clearing for him just just by himself so

1586
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,110
what would happen is that is that

1587
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:29,040
because guys would go debit meaning they

1588
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,810
end up as they've lost me they're down

1589
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,520
25 thousand or fifty or a hundred

1590
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,310
thousand dollars the guy that owns a

1591
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,480
clearing firm doesn't want to say hey

1592
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,220
you can't trade until you pay this off

1593
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,110
they'd want to let me go back into the

1594
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,720
pit to work it to work it down

1595
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,000
well after you know you've got four or

1596
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,950
five of these troublesome or 15 of these

1597
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,450
troublesome traders that are constantly

1598
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,250
running debits you start to get a little

1599
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,560
worried and so what they did is start

1600
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,920
they hired me to work with these guys

1601
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,600
most of the information most of the

1602
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,060
insight let's say that that you'll find

1603
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,830
in the disciplined trader and trading in

1604
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,070
the zone came from me working with these

1605
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:11,070
floor traders on a daily basis and it

1606
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:13,560
was I'm laughing because obviously it

1607
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,150
was quite it was quite trip working with

1608
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,340
these guys because they are not like

1609
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,650
they are not like you and me okay that's

1610
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:24,270
that's that's really about the best I

1611
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,590
can the best way I can describe it

1612
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,700
without going into a lot of detail

1613
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:31,140
they're not like you and me so anyway

1614
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:34,050
you know this is kind of a maybe a long

1615
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,750
drawn-out introduction to the fact that

1616
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,730
what we're talking about here is that

1617
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:43,230
you guys have a really wonderful trading

1618
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,690
methodology where there is an enormous

1619
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,180
amount of potential for you to be able

1620
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,170
to make a consistent income from being

1621
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,870
able to take full advantage of the

1622
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:56,790
potential that this trading methodology

1623
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:01,500
offers you but I would say that there's

1624
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,650
probably it wouldn't be unfair for me to

1625
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,920
say

1626
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:12,439
it wouldn't be unfair for me to say that

1627
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:13,910
there's probably what I'm going to call

1628
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:18,140
the profit gap the gap between the

1629
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,130
potential and your bottom line results

1630
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,359
this is the potential and there's your

1631
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,549
bottom line results most people think

1632
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:30,559
that when they realize that this gap

1633
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,099
exists that somehow learning more about

1634
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:37,719
the markets is what's going to fill it

1635
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,680
and what you're here today to learn is

1636
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:47,680
that that is categorically not the case

1637
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:50,269
you have to learn more about yourself

1638
01:06:50,269 --> 01:06:55,189
and how you interact with your trading

1639
01:06:55,189 --> 01:06:58,069
platform and the market to be able to

1640
01:06:58,069 --> 01:07:00,259
fill this gap there are psychological

1641
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:01,939
skills involved then wise talk about

1642
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:04,969
psychological skills well let's do we do

1643
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:06,619
anybody think of an example of a

1644
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:08,959
psychological skill this this this is

1645
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:10,430
difficult I don't think you know I'm not

1646
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,599
saying that you should have the answer

1647
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,359
but well can you think of an analogy and

1648
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,209
you know it may be in other parts of the

1649
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,039
way we express ourselves that you can

1650
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,749
think of what would be an example of a

1651
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:25,130
psychological skill anger management

1652
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:29,900
okay that good anybody else okay what

1653
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,400
about a situation that was just anybody

1654
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,009
watch will Milton here lately just it

1655
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,469
was on I'm not a big tennis fan but I

1656
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,519
just happen to be watching it and

1657
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:39,079
because I knew that this I was doing

1658
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:41,299
this this workshop here this is

1659
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:42,499
something who really sticks on my mind

1660
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:44,719
what's the difference between between

1661
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:46,429
let's say oh here it doesn't even a

1662
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,900
better example what's the difference

1663
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,719
between a bath a pro basketball player

1664
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:53,349
who can stand at the free-throw line and

1665
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:55,719
hit 20 in a row

1666
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:59,299
even 30 in a row where the thing about

1667
01:07:59,299 --> 01:08:02,479
the variables are fixed the line in the

1668
01:08:02,479 --> 01:08:04,160
basket and the distances they're all

1669
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,249
fixed and they've got the motor skills

1670
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,499
to be able to hit like I said 10 15 20

1671
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:11,689
in a row but they get into a situation

1672
01:08:11,689 --> 01:08:18,259
where there's 1 second left and the

1673
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:21,500
score is tied and this basket is going

1674
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,939
to win the game

1675
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:27,500
any chokes that's a cycle the guy that

1676
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,649
doesn't choke it has a psychological

1677
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,170
skill that the other one doesn't

1678
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,290
trading without fear is a psychological

1679
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,520
skill it is a skill that the

1680
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,819
professionals have acquired and if they

1681
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,969
have evolved beyond the typical mindset

1682
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:48,890
or the kind of mindset that the typical

1683
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:53,569
trader operates out of so when we're

1684
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:56,120
talking about trading or thinking like a

1685
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,719
pro that's exactly what I'm saying

1686
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,270
I'm saying that you will evolve beyond

1687
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:07,100
the typical mindset so that you can take

1688
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,219
full advantage full admit this

1689
01:09:10,219 --> 01:09:11,988
represents if this line represents

1690
01:09:11,988 --> 01:09:13,640
potential that you can take the

1691
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,649
potential of your methodology that you

1692
01:09:15,649 --> 01:09:17,089
can take full advantage of your

1693
01:09:17,089 --> 01:09:20,120
methodology because it has to do with

1694
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,719
your state of mind
