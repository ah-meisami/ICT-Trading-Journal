00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,300
hey Dexter huh some kid told me you have

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,899
a laboratory a laboratory Dexter your

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,000
lab it is the one thing he does not have

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,219
and it will still make you the smartest

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,160
one of all go ahead show him your lab

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,080
come and be amazed that the world of

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,039
Dexter's Laboratory hello welcome to the

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,800
Monster Lab here Dexter

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,400
today we are going to dipping into the

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,880
standard deviations lose power of three

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,079
language is Spanish I wish I called

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,100
sight a lot but I will be very direct

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,520
and clear if you don't understand most

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,760
things you are probably new this content

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,280
it's not for newbies or newcomers

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,520
everything was learning from ICT but

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,680
with my own research

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,580
all start with an opening a power of

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,580
three this can be any power of three

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,799
monthly power of three

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,159
weekly power of three daily power of

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
three four all power of 3 any power of

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
3.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,500
the first element for power of 3 is the

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,460
accumulation or consolidation

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,600
the second phase the power of 3 is the

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,580
manipulation

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,540
and the third phase of power of 3 is

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,659
distribution or expansion

31
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,119
okay all

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,460
face

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,140
accumulation manipulation and

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,340
distribution in one single candle one

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,899
single candle it's

36
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,100
alt okay

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
must think

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,040
the that expansion is only measured with

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,840
manipulation but we can also measure

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,220
manipulation with accumulation

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,739
once the expansion is finished

42
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,280
we can also measure the retracement or

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,319
reversal

44
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,260
we are looking for synchronization

45
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,220
to know if price is in accumulation

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,080
phase or manipulation first phase or

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,360
distribution phase

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,520
identify

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
where

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,200
price delivery it's in the present

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,980
moment when it's finished and when it's

52
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,420
start the next phase of the power of 3.

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,140
we start with the opening

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,459
on

55
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,720
we identify the accumulation range

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,459
inside the accumulation range we will

57
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,300
look for the most discernible range

58
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,560
highest swing High and the most recent

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,440
swing low that was broken the dog will

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,159
or two and a half deviations will be the

61
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,220
projection for the manipulation

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,019
phase okay in right now the monthly or

63
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,620
the candle the power of three

64
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,280
it's

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,819
in bearish right but your anticipate

66
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,659
that this mob price is the manipulation

67
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,280
and look for one reversals in the two or

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,799
two and a half deviations for the next

69
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,620
phase of delivery yeah the distribution

70
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,440
or expansion

71
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,040
once the manipulation is finished in the

72
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,819
two or two and half deviations

73
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,500
we will look for the lower swing low and

74
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,879
the swing High most recent

75
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
is it will it is the last move in

76
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,820
direction of money manipulation phase

77
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,479
okay this high and this low

78
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,979
um project

79
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,840
upside for the distribution or expansion

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,340
phase for this power of three

81
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,259
that will be the range project

82
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,500
for distribution or expansion

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,280
the double or two and a half two or two

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
and a half deviations for the

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
projections for expansions

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,060
there are some rules to look for

87
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,139
a standard deviations if price close

88
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,820
above the two and a half deviations with

89
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,220
body candle

90
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,440
um but we'll have that for another video

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
once price

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,060
complete the expansion

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,460
in two or two and half deviations

94
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,780
we anticipate retracements or reversals

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,979
to the

96
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,320
equilibrium range

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
of the current dealing range that is low

98
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,860
and is high

99
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,020
anticipate retracements to equilibrium

100
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,780
range to know if it's a retracement or a

101
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,479
reversals depends on the high time frame

102
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,400
premise

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,780
if price has unfinished business he will

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,900
continue in the same direction

105
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,919
once have finished his retracement

106
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,720
if price no help unfinished business a

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,479
reversals is very likely

108
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,139
we look for the highest swing High and

109
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,979
the most recent broke swing low to

110
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,960
project the retracement or reversals

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,759
this low

112
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,800
and this high

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
same Dynamics we will look for two or

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
two and a half deviations for these

115
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,020
projections the retracements or

116
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,740
reversals let's look an example in every

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,360
Z

118
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,060
with the monthly power of three

119
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
here

120
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,560
we have the opening of the monthly power

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,500
of three we can visualize the

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,259
accumulation

123
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,259
manipulation expansion

124
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,199
retracements if we see it it's very

125
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,319
ambiguous to know where one's the genes

126
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
and another ends circumulations or

127
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,479
consolidation manipulation expansion

128
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,880
retracement or reversals very very

129
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,919
ambiguous

130
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,479
I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes

131
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,699
let's dig deeper

132
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,639
inside the accumulation phase

133
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,360
this is the opening the monthly power of

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,860
three

135
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,160
accumulation phase we look for the most

136
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,560
discernible range to project the

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
manipulation

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,979
and you look this high

139
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,099
on this low this will be below the

140
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,800
opening the projection for manipulation

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,599
it's below of the opening power of three

142
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,080
it is important to identify the

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
direction of the institutional order

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,960
flow and identify which standard

145
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,979
deviations match with high time frame PD

146
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,800
arrays of the same time frame of the

147
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
power of three under development

148
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,400
if you work with the monthly power of

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:37,560
three you can search or identify monthly

150
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,620
deviations for the accumulation range

151
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,240
projection

152
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,019
anticipate

153
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,760
then finish for the manipulation move we

154
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,040
can see the last movement of

155
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,839
manipulation

156
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,500
in downside

157
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,779
identify this single o and swing High

158
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,800
must discernible for projecting the

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,760
distribution or expansion phase look

160
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,120
this high and this low I will project

161
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,420
for the expansion or distribution phase

162
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,580
to the 2R or two and a half divisions

163
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,459
once the start of the distribution phase

164
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,899
we can't find specific areas where price

165
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,080
will have recumulation or

166
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,240
pre-distribution

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,700
to continue

168
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,279
towards its or two or two and half

169
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,839
divisions

170
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,600
these areas will be found in divisions

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,360
one and one and half one and one and

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,180
half this area also it's the Silver

173
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,640
Bullet Zone it's very very powerful

174
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,480
you have a power of three in development

175
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,640
and in this point price is an expansion

176
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,740
phase

177
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,980
you know you you already have the

178
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,260
accumulation

179
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,399
manipulation and when price is an

180
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,140
expansion phase is more easy look for

181
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,040
a specific areas there is distribution

182
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,940
or re-accumulation I look for internal

183
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,959
liquidity in this area it's

184
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,579
um any internal liquidity verbalog apps

185
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,680
by side

186
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
imbalance cell site imbalance

187
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,700
any internal liquidity inside this Zone

188
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,760
the Silver Bullet Zone and look for

189
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,660
moods there

190
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,700
and if if price had unfinished business

191
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,260
in utsai I will look for both deviations

192
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,459
or five deviations if price have one

193
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,140
pdra or imbalance in this area in this

194
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,579
case we Excel the power deviations even

195
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,440
five deviations this is because price

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,380
looking for monthly

197
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,980
pdra monthly order Block in this area

198
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,980
in this point you can see the

199
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,200
multi-cernibular range for retracements

200
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,820
or reversals

201
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,959
this high and three this swing low it's

202
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:52,980
four

203
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,899
the predictions for the retracement or

204
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,399
reversals

205
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,600
face between High swing low

206
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,260
the same Dynamics we will look for in

207
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,160
each phase of delivery you can look for

208
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,800
one and one and a half deviations for

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,760
the Silver Bullet Zone you can use two

210
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,700
and two and a half for

211
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,040
anticipate one when

212
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
the face of delivery is finished and

213
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,820
when the next phase of delivery is start

214
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,019
here we can see the three phase of the

215
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,899
power of three being measured with

216
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,740
Precision the piece if together like a

217
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,300
fossil the conclusion we don't not only

218
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,120
mature the manipulation phase as

219
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,180
everyone thinks we can measure the

220
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,740
accumulation range manipulation range

221
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,320
retracements range it all depends on

222
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
which phase of delivery its price in the

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,279
present moment

224
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,700
your your own back testing with

225
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
different power of three in different

226
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,459
time frames I only warned you and you

227
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,339
will not learn your City Market in the

228
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,779
same way

229
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,779
