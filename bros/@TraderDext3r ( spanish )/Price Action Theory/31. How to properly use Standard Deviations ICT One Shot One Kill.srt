1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Well, the profile would be the following Monday

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
consolidation Ok this is like an amd

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
in a broader fractal weekly

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,980
accumulation this would be the manipulation

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,820
of this low to this High Ok and what we

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,660
would be looking for here is the turn so

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,580
that it begins its expansion Ok an

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,300
accumulation then  an

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,660
upward manipulation Tuesday maximum of the week hide of

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,020
the week Ok this Hi we would hope that it

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
is not taken that the entire structure is respected

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,719
and we would look for the previs week and low Ok

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
this like like

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,980
this would be the profile that what the

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
shortenme the  shorten discipline who

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,780
are the ones looking for One Kill

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
are practically looking for the

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
weekly profile This is the key to ong you look for

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
the weekly profile you look for where

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
the maximum low

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,159
of the week is likely to form and you look for the objectives that it

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
would achieve if it were in  the

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
correct direction in this case because in

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,380
a hypothetical case, being bearish, if a

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
bearish mind were to develop weekly, our Target is the

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,140
previews,

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
we take the last movement of Vela's bodies,

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
the bulish movement, which was the one that

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,140
formed the High of the week

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,540
and we project it  to match

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
the previews Look Joshua here I'm not

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
taking the highs because it doesn't match the one it

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
matches me below if I take the

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
High low and it's okay it's not bad to

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
do it like this

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
but since we want a more

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
achievable goal for example

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
maybe this  This size is

39
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,259
problematic, for example, where

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
the two is

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
towards the previews weekly Love, it may

42
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:16,959
be problematic in this area as such. That

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,379
is, if you have your Take profit in the

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
two deviations. Imagine that you say,

45
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,819
it's not that I take profits in both

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
expressions.  always and I put my Take

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
profit there then you put your Take profit

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
here but our Target or

49
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
high time frame objective of Price as such is the

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Imagine that price begins to expand

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
bearishly it

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
reaches the previs weekly low and does not reach

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
your two deviations it reaches the previous one

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
but  not the deviations then Here you

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
start to have some setbacks, a

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,860
setback to internal is an example Ok

57
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
then you no longer managed to pay at the

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
lowest points

59
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,019
which would be below the previews

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
weekly low Ok for waiting for the two

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
deviations that's why it's  What I say is that the

62
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,620
best thing is always to make them match. If

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I take Vela bodies, for example, there

64
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
are Vela bodies, because

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
practically at two deviations

66
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
you are already paying yourself and at 2.5 if he gives it to you,

67
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,260
by then you have already paid yourself

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
in the  two deviations

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
OK But now deviation 2 is closer,

70
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
which is where we commonly have

71
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,799
setbacks. So now you have two

72
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,739
objectives where you can pay yourself and I am talking

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
about achievable objectives Well, that is

74
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,379
theidea,

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
not to do pirouettes or twists but

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
simply the closest thing to reaching

77
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,990
[Music]

78
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
[Applause]
