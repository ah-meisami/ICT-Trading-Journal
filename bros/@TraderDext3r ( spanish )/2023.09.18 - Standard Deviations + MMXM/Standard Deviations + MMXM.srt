00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,619
thank you

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,859
hello welcome to the Monster Lab here

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,119
Dexter

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,060
this is the first video for the correct

or cell model

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,579
I remember you my native language is

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,559
Spanish

12
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,579
so please patience

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,440
some things

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,360
I will tell you in Spanish because

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,219
I need more words to explain some things

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,760
I don't think it is a problem to

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,420
understand you can add automatic

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,060
subtitles or captions to English at the

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,799
bottom right

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,340
okay

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,420
everything starts with an opening

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,780
it is important to know that power of 3

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,740
or candle you are working too

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,680
identify your accumulation manipulation

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,619
and distribution phase with high

26
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,640
precision

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,780
if you do not know what you are

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,479
measuring you will hit lows in the price

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,579
fluctuations

30
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,240
time it's now limited to kill zones or

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,460
macros the openings timings are supports

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,420
Naturals and provide context by knowing

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,680
if we are below or above the opening

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,920
power of three in development

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,740
the three phase of price delivery are

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,860
the ones we can measure looking for the

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,580
right sample for each of them

38
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,200
okay

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,319
um in the description you can see the

40
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,840
last video for the standard deviation

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,040
correct content plus power of three

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,080
you need more

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
context for this presentation so here is

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,280
the last previous video standard

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,980
deviation Theory number one

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,360
price being algorithmic moves according

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,459
to the previous range

48
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,980
if the manipulation range

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,819
was to the expansion we will follow the

50
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,280
double or a little more

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,160
be taking a sample the manipulation

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,480
range and reaching two or two and half

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,239
deviations we will anticipate that price

54
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,300
will have a one retracement or one

55
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,980
reversal

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,640
this is because price is not

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,440
unidirectional and will seek to

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
rebalance the inefficiencies henerate

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,640
the previous range okay

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,739
rebalance inefficiencies below the

61
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,680
equilibrium range

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,540
the priority of our retracement it's the

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,420
inefficiencies or salsa liquidity or by

64
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,620
side liquidity below or above the

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,459
equilibrium Branch for the current range

66
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,659
to know if it will be a retracement or

67
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,500
one reversal it's it's necessary to have

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,640
a big picture of a high time frame

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,360
the easiest way to identify a

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,840
manipulation range it's to observe the

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,620
week of the current candle and in lower

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,580
time frame find the most discernible

73
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,239
range

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,860
Market maker Dex model

75
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,860
pronunciation

76
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,620
Market maker models they will be format

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,600
from a pdra high time frame and will end

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,160
in a opposite PD array of the same time

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
frame

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,960
among these two high time frame Speedy

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,060
arrays we will identify the

82
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,360
openings and accumulation manipulation

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,940
distribution phase

84
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,440
that are format on the way from the pdra

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,300
a

86
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,000
for the pdra B

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,160
so in one market maker

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,080
buy or sell model you need two high time

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,020
frames PDR rates from the same time

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,040
frame in this case have this pdra a pdra

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,860
b and bdra

92
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,340
C

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,560
in the words of standard division

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,419
theories we could say that one and one

95
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,639
Uncle deviations it's the

96
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,639
re-accumulation or redistributions

97
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,620
levels

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,280
in other words Silver Bullet Zone in the

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,940
words of a standard deviation theories

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,280
two two and hard deviations and four

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,400
deviations it's the smart money reversal

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,320
for the market maker models

103
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,360
so in this point you can combine the

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,660
high time frame pdra a

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,979
and two or two deviations for the

106
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,340
previous range on the left

107
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,460
um you can anticipate the smart money

108
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,900
reversal

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,259
one retracement or

110
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:20,400
reversal today pdra oppose pdra High

111
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,259
time frame B

112
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,080
so in this point

113
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,560
you will expect one

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,979
Market maker cell model do the high time

115
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,139
frame pdra B and

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,300
you will expect one market maker by

117
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,740
model to the high time frame pdra C in

118
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,180
this case your order flow is bullish so

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,600
you can anticipate retracement and one

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
continuation

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,699
simplicize this low and this high

122
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,860
deviations for the previous Range pdra

123
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,860
High time frame

124
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,220
and you

125
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,860
anticipate one retracement so I take

126
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,220
this high and this low for the sample

127
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,419
size

128
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,500
in one deviations for this range

129
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,639
Silver Bullet Zone you anticipate one

130
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,220
retracement

131
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,039
for the redistributions

132
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,919
levels

133
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,720
you anticipate or identify the

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,360
displacements in this area

135
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
look for

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,139
value gaps or

137
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,660
any internal liquidity

138
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,180
distribution zones it's the same

139
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,099
Silver Bullet Zone

140
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,979
price continuations little retracement

141
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,800
this this point is other level for

142
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,020
redistribution

143
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,860
and you anticipate that this move

144
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,180
reaction to the evasions level for the

145
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,080
sample size this high and this low you

146
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,160
will expect the double

147
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,580
to standard deviations and look little

148
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,940
retracement and continuations to the

149
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,059
high time frame pdra B

150
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,399
in this point to the deviations

151
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,600
how to truth in this move it's one

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,019
retracement and no reversal

153
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,440
you can choose in this move or continue

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,660
ages if price have unfinished business

155
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,519
in this case is one high time frame pdra

156
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,279
oppose it for the main range in the high

157
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
time frame PD array

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,380
a

159
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,620
so you can choose in this move it's only

160
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,339
one retracement for the continuations do

161
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,700
the two and hard deviations and when

162
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,779
price reacted to 100 deviations and PD

163
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,680
array B you anticipate the smart money

164
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,980
reversal for the next moves the market

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,060
maker by Model start in this point this

166
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,480
point is your action point smart money

167
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,920
reversal you need two things two and

168
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,220
hard deviations and pdra high time frame

169
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,120
opposite

170
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,600
Market maker by Model start I take this

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,660
high and this low for the sample size

172
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,440
for the next moves

173
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,100
price

174
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,779
one deviations

175
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,940
for the sample size

176
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,339
you will expect one retracement

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
any internal liquidity in this area you

178
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,620
look for displacements

179
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,500
will anticipate one retracement and

180
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,800
continuations to the to the deviations

181
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,779
to the aviation's reaction and price

182
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,560
retracement but it's different this

183
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,899
retracement in two deviations it's

184
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,839
different for this retracement in the

185
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,060
market maker cell model in two

186
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,700
deviations you see one little

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
retracement for the continuations to the

188
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,180
Chua Hull deviations in this point in

189
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,440
two deviations you see one more deeper

190
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,640
retracement to the cell side liquidity

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,500
you can take this low on this high in

192
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,160
two deviations you

193
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,560
anticipate one retracement in one case

194
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,260
is in one little retracement and in

195
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,640
other case it's more deeper

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,940
if you look one market

197
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,339
with high correlation

198
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,660
in this point you can find one crash

199
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,120
correlation lows this is one

200
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,839
confirmations for the continuations Okay

201
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,540
so

202
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,920
if

203
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,839
how you choose in this move it's no

204
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,440
reversal and it's one retracement

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,019
you can choose in this move

206
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,500
only if you have unfinished business

207
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,980
in this point pdra High time frame C

208
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,000
it's the unfinished business so you can

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,560
choose in this move it's only for

210
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,660
re-accumulation phase

211
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,279
price

212
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,440
continuations

213
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,160
Market Chief in this high

214
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,740
displacements

215
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,880
fair value Gap other accumulation Zone

216
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,019
and in this point you can confirm the

217
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,220
prices continuations the upside price to

218
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,040
unhull deviations reacted smart money

219
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,380
reversal Zone

220
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,420
but

221
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,680
the same Dynamics how truth

222
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,339
price don't have one reversal in this

223
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,060
point

224
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,740
the only way you can choose in there

225
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,100
continuations it's if you have

226
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,720
unfinished business if price Hub

227
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,380
unfinished business to the upside you

228
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,980
can choose this move it's only one the

229
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,860
accumulation level and when price

230
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,639
have this retracement you anticipate one

231
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,360
move to the pdra high time frame C and

232
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,480
moves to the four deviations for the

233
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,500
sample size in this case this high and

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,600
this low

235
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,279
in every phase of redistribution or

236
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,180
re-accumulations you can find crash

237
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,940
correlations highs or crash correlation

238
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,779
laws for the confirmations for the next

239
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,800
moves in this point you can find crash

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,380
correlation highs in this high and this

241
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,339
high

242
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,260
and in this low this low or this low in

243
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,139
other short-term low

244
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,040
this is one way to confirm the

245
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,680
continuations

246
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,320
how to apply the standard deviations

247
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,260
Theory number one

248
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,560
you need understanding of high time

249
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,459
frame

250
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,160

274
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,199
your confirmation tool

275
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,160
it's the smart money tool SMD

276
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,600
this will help use identify when smart

277
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,779
money is ready to make a change in the

278
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,660
state of delivery the expansions to

279
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,720
retracement or reversals or the

280
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
accumulation to manipulations or the

281
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,860
manipulations to distribution

282
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,899
use the apy example for

283
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,720
this week

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,779
this is the weekly chart

285
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,120
I take the

286
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,440
the XY chart and compare with

287
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,000
USD JPY and you see the last moves it's

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,480
bullish the order flow for this Market

289
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,199
it's bullish okay you can't see the

290
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,519
crash correlation lows in this point

291
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,360
write the last previous candles it's

292
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,240
totality bullish

293
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,959
I take the three previous candles for

294
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,339
data for the work in the next

295
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,680
power of three

296
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,920
this this is the one

297
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,620
the first candle second candle and three

298
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,560
candle data

299
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,199
you can identify the PDR rates in this

300
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,520
portion of price

301
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,419
in the three previous scandals brights

302
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,559
the previous weekly low taken this fair

303
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,160
value Gap continuations to this weekly

304
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,740
volume a balance

305
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,400
and right now price is in this point

306
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
this weekly volume imbalance and I

307
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,799
identify the

308
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,520
PD arrays opposite for the same time

309
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,059
frame in the three previous scandals in

310
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,539
this point I have this

311
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,260
preview Scandal this reaction block

312
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,480
previous weekly low

313
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,400
and the mid of this week the large week

314
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,660
this week taking the previous weekly low

315
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,880
um

316
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
reversal continuation to the weekly

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
volume imbalance so this High time frame

318
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,820
Speedy arrays

319
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,720
it's transport or overlapping in lower

320
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,480
time frames told us to speed the arrays

321
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,780

one old Shard you can see the three

327
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,600
weeks data this is the one week two week

328
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,500
and three weeks Okay so

329
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
you

330
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
can identify in this time frame in lower

333
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,820
you look for the most these are nibbly

334
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,240
range for projections your standard

335
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,360
deviations okay you have the three weeks

336
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,240
data for the standard deviations and the

337
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,039
previous range

338
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,799
is this week in the

339
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,539
two weeks look back I take this high and

340
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,120
this low for the sample size the

341
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,700
manipulation range taking this previous

342
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,280
weekly low this is the high time frame

343
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,620
pdra

344
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,840
and look for the moves to the weekly

345
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,559
volume imbalance so I take this sample

346
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
size

347
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,940
um projection today

348
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,400
one one and a half two and one whole

349
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,580
deviations so when you start new week

350
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,960
you need

351
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,740
three questions the few questions

352
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,960
where does price come from

353
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,880
in this case

354
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,820
price come from here

355
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,080
is the low I Stay High

356
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,840
is the primary information

357
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,419
the second question is where is price

358
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,820
right now

359
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,140
price right now is in two and you are

360
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,780
all deviations for the previous range

361
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,720
the D is high and this low

362
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,059
so the next question is where is it

363
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,700
likely to go

364
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,679
In This Moment

365
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,460
in the standard deviation Theory you can

366
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,960
anticipate one retracement or reversal

367
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,780
smart money reversal in this point two

368
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,299
and two on Hull deviations

369
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,600
standard deviations Theory

370
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,840
be taken a sample the manipulation range

371
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,360
this high and this low this is the

372
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,440
manipulation range or the sample size

373
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,620
deviations

374
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,690
[Music]

375
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,000
price

376
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,020
will seek to rebalance the

377
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,200
inefficiencies and rate below

378
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,900
the equilibrium range in the previous

379
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,200
expansions this is the equilibrium

380
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,480
previous expansion where is the most

381
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,900
discernible internal liquidity or

382
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,200
displacement is in this area look these

383
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,059
are a price action you don't find

384
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:45,600
um

385
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,080
internal liquidity of use

386
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,799
but in this point below the equilibrium

387
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,820
you can find these areas for internal

388
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,780
liquidity so in this point you will

389
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,340
anticipate one retracement or reversal

390
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,620
to discount for the current range

391
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:23,470

[Music]

394
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,260
Market maker modeling the weekly power

395
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,280
of three

396
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,260
the more important question it's where

397
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,020
it's the opening

398
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,320
for the present candle

399
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,240
in function for the previous range

400
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,960
is

401
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,820
seminal

402
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
is

403
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,960
standard deviations

404
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,960
foreign

405
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,520
okay entonces surprise

406
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,500
apertura in one or one and half

407
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,400
deviations two percent

408
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,580
this is

409
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,380
a

410
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,400
in this point some precise this high and

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,860
this low price

412
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,419
retracement

413
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,380
to the high time frame pdre B in this

414
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,059
case previous weekly low and to a whole

415
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,700
deviations this is the

416
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,840
action point is more money reversal

417
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,460
price

418
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,860
Market shift this high and you have new

419
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,980
sample size or the New Market maker by

420
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,279
Model start in this point

421
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,120
sample size this high and this low and

422
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,580
price low risk buy the first

423
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,299
accumulation level disorder block is

424
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,120
changing the state of delivery

425
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,700
and in this point the previous weekly

426
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,820
low you can

427
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,080
find one crash correlation laws with dxy

428
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,779
in this point so this is one

429
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,320
confirmations for this Market maker by

430
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,140
model and the next phase of

431
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,240
re-accumulations is in

432
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,279
internal liquidity

433
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,320
on the right of or on the left in this

434
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,080
point is one inversion for Value up

435
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,059
reaccumulation

436
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:27,360
other accumulation so this fair value

437
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,960
Gap look what is the candle it's above

438
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,140
this level this is the real accumulation

439
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,760
level in one deviation one deviation

440
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,419
Silver Bullet Zone retracement to the

441
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,039
One internal liquidity

442
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,679
retracement 4 continuations to the two

443
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,100
deviations or two and a half deviations

444
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,400
in this case price one deviation

445
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,720
retracement this fair value Gap

446
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,659
re-accumulation

447
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,140
other level for a accumulation this

448
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,940
internal liquidity BC and price continue

449
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,580
above the weekly open weekly open it's

450
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,700
the level for the candle in development

451
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,380
development

452
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,100
okay so this is all for this

453
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,840
presentation

454
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
a

455
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,960
qualcare commentario is bye
