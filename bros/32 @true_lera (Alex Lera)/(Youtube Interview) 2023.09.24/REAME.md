==========================================================
as a trader We have 2 mentality:
1. trader mentality => this mentality wants to make paid asap
2. technical analyst mentality => this mentality wants to make maximum profit
we have to create a balance between them.

@TheCryptoQueen - 
any business requires 3 things: 
1. you study / 
2. you test your knowledge acquired through study / 
3. you apply (invest TIME and MONEY) and you DEDICATE to it!

@hussnain pervaiz - 
FVG is merely a location, a POSSIBLE point of interest...
doesn't mean price will also REACT from there. 
So the 2 candles are: 1st one is the sign that price wants to react
2nd candle is the confirmation it DOES react
==========================================================


==========================================================
this mentality wants to make maximum profit
