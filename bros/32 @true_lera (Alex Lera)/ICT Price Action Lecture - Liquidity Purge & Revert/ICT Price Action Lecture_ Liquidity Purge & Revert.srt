1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
welcome back folks

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
it's been a while since i've posted

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,279
another video to the youtube channel

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,039
so i appreciate your patience and as

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
always your continued interest

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
in my content all right so we're going

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,039
to talk about

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,599
liquidity i'm going to try to make this

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
as brief as i possibly can

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,239
i tend to go overboard sometimes with

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,000
insights and

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
commentary but i'm going to try to do it

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,680
as short and concise as i possibly can

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,360
which invariably will always

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,399
inspire questions concerns it will

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:48,879
create

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,000
gaps in your understanding and that's

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
normal okay just know that it's meant

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,520
for you to investigate on your own study

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,800
because i'm going to frame it in that

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
capacity so that way you know

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
while it's not just perfectly

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
form-fitted for this example

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
students of mine for a long period of

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
time will

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
hear certain things that i've talked

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
about in passing

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
in other commentaries and other youtube

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,000
series

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,280
videos that you can find on this channel

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,720
i'm not a pattern trader

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
in the sense that i'm looking for as

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
it's commonly referred to as

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
a trading pattern like a harmonic

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
pattern okay like a bat

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
or gartly or

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,720
a fibonacci sequence we're not looking

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,280
for those

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
things so while i may reach for

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
fibonacci to

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
show a level of projection and maybe

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,680
show

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119
and highlight an area that is

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,000
visually representing a valuation that

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,479
would be

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,320
undervalued or overvalued or in the

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
sense that it's overbought oversold

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,040
without using an oscillator okay we're

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
looking at specific

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
ranges so i'm going to touch a little

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
bit on my l7 ranges

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
specifically in this lesson it's going

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,038
to be a seven range example

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,599
and again it's not trying to teach you

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
everything because there's no

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
way i could do this but it's also one

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
more

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
illustration of my i haven't ran out of

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,480
yeast

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
okay this baker has a lot of yeast and i

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
can

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
continue to teach for decades in the

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
future and still not run out of content

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,519
because i understand the algorithm now

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,959
what i'm going to show you today

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
would be normally reserved for students

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
that are in my mentorship but i want you

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
to appreciate the level of

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,519
systematic delivery of price

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319
why it does what it does and try to just

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
simply suspend your belief system

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,000
on any other model

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
or school of thought like if you're a

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
supply and demand

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
you know follower or if you're an elite

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
wave trader or harmonic trader

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
if you trade uh market profile

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
all those things just for a moment try

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
to put that

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
to the side and try not to lean on

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
any of your logic just for a moment okay

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,560
during

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,440
the time of this recording just suspend

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
all belief in that

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
i'm not saying believe this

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
wholeheartedly but i want you to just

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,440
listen to it

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
and then go into your charts and you'll

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
find it okay

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
so all right so we're looking at the

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,400
dollar cad and this is a pair

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
admittedly i don't trade a lot but if i

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,000
don't get a set

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
up in euro dollar or pound dollar i will

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,120
sometimes

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
resort to trading this pair or the

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
aussie dollar

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
okay so so i just want to toss that

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
you know the little disclaimer out there

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
i'm not actively trading dollar cat a

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,000
lot

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
but i want you to think about some

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
general themes here

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
again i mentioned the l7 range theory

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
and it's basically trading inside the

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
range

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
i'm going to frame a range for you so

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
that we can see a little bit of the

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
context that's

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
required but most of the things i'm

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
going to show you here are pretty

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
simple and straightforward and it's not

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
hard it's not about moving parts

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,319
but there are very specific rule-based

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
ideas that need to be considered when

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,720
you

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
look and study at old data and you'll

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
see that this

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
occurs when we're looking at

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
liquidity okay the easiest way to

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
determine that

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
is anything that would reside above

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
a short-term high

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
or an intermediate term high now you

125
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
might look at this area here and say

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
which one is the high

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,479
well this candle is slightly higher than

128
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
all of them but whenever i see

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
multiple candles or multiple levels that

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
look very close to one another in height

131
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
or in depth in terms of the the lows if

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,759
we're looking at

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
if we're considering the opposite in

134
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,120
terms of looking for

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
sales liquidity buy side liquidity rests

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,639
above old highs

137
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
now it can come in the form of these

138
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,240
areas like this where it's

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
relative equal highs okay that's one of

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
the concepts that

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
i use to frame the idea and

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
understanding of liquidity

143
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
now liquidity can be formed on the basis

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
of a single

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
point of reference like this high or

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
this high or this high

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
or it could be a collection of

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,880
relatively equal highs or relatively

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,440
equal

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
lows like this there this would be

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,039
considered

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
relative equal lows in my school of

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,160
thought

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
this is relative equal highs in my

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
school of thought this is a single

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,199
by side liquidity pool old high this is

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,320
a single

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
bicep equity pool short term high

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
these things okay are not required

160
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400
for a label sense it's just i'm showing

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
you

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,039
the contrast between the two

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
but generally anything above an

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
old high would be buy side liquidity

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
that means there's buy orders up there

166
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,280
now as a new trader that sounds a little

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,639
alien it doesn't make sense

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
who would be wanting to buy up there

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
because your books are telling you buy

170
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
low sell high

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
there's always traders that are going

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
short or traders that want to buy on a

173
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
breakout that goes above that so that's

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,919
the

175
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
context of why that's buy side liquidity

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
and i teach it

177
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
from a institutional perspective i'm not

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
looking at it in terms of saying

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
you know this is a resistance level i'm

180
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,360
teaching that this

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,199
is an area where there are willing

182
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
buyers up there

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
and that perception of price action

184
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
once you start adopting that and looking

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
at price with that

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,919
view your

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
opinions your bias your

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
analysis will slowly start to migrate

189
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,960
away from

190
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
away from the retail logic that all of

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,160
us are

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
indoctrinated with when we first come

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
into trading that's a normal thing

194
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
but statistically proven if you look at

195
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,000
all of the

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,880
retail logic that's available to us why

197
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
is it that

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
90 of the traders lose money it's

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,639
because the logic is flawed

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,599
okay so if it's flawed what is the

201
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,479
common denominator as to why retail

202
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,120
logic

203
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,759
fails more times than it wins i'm not

204
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,440
saying it can't win i'm not

205
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
now i'm not saying that retail traders

206
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
always lose and i'm not saying that a

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
retail trader can't be

208
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,599
profitable even using retail logic but

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
they have to make a departure from

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
all things retail at some point they

211
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
have to inject their own experience

212
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
into the analysis and that experience is

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
going to be a byproduct of looking at

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,039
things

215
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,720
experientially and seeing okay i've

216
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
learned this pattern in the books i've

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
seen this author

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
i've seen this you know educator or

219
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
trader

220
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
guru mention this

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
idea but i've seen in this instance when

222
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
that pattern's there

223
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
it fails because of other things that i

224
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,759
didn't learn in other books

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
and you're going to have these

226
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
epiphanies that's experience that you

227
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,199
can't just get from a book

228
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,919
i can't transpose all of my experience i

229
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
can talk about things that i learn

230
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
experientially

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
like what i'm going to show you here but

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
it's important for you to understand

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
that

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
the main common denominator is the

235
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,199
markets

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,400
are manipulated and they're manipulated not on a random basis but they're manipulated with a rule-based

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
structure so i'm going to give you a

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
little bit of the details

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
and how you can start looking for these

243
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
types of signatures in price

244
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
so if you look at this dollar cad we

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
have an old low here and price has

246
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
rallied up now

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
retail logic states that we have this

248
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,000
low

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
as a support level why because price

250
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
moved away from there

251
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
we don't go into describing why it would

252
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,519
have turned there

253
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
from a retail trader they just

254
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
deem it as well that's support because

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,839
why if

256
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
price hits it and repels then it's a

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,839
support level okay that might be simple

258
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,680
enough for you to subscribe to i don't

259
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,399
look at like

260
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,680
that i look at it as okay there is now

261
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
engineered liquidity

262
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
now what does that mean that means that

263
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
the market has turned on a dime here and

264
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
rallied higher

265
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
i see this as a liquidity pool

266
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
of sell side orders okay sell side

267
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
liquidity

268
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
anyone that would have an order below

269
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
that would be a seller

270
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
they want to sell why would they want to

271
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
sell below that because anyone that's

272
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
long here

273
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
or even chasing price they're going to

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
look back to this level and feel

275
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
confident that well it bounced there

276
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,720
before so

277
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
even if it starts to come down which may

278
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
be very uncomfortable for them

279
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,680
they have belief and faith

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
and confidence that their books have

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,959
indoctrinated them

282
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
into believing that this is a level that

283
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
should prevent

284
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
price from going lower and i used to

285
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,839
think like that until i lost

286
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,160
thousands of dollars and then it quickly

287
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,519
dawned on me that i'm probably not

288
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,800
following the right things

289
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
so i want you to think about that low

290
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,160
with

291
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,600
the target or bullseye of

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,519
the price wanting to go down to that

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
level to attack

294
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
the liquidity that rests below that low

295
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
now it may take

296
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
months before it gets to this low but if

297
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
it gets to this low

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
this is what i want you to start looking

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
at and it doesn't only work on daily

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,079
charts this works on

301
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
hourly charts it works on four hour

302
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
charts it works on weekly charts

303
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,920
okay so it's important that you know

304
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
that this liquidity

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
idea i'm teaching you here is just part

306
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
of the framework

307
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,440
but we can see eventually on the 9th of

308
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,160
november

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
price trades down and goes below that

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
low this

311
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
is an important event when this day runs

312
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,760
below this low

313
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
it's a crucial event algorithmically

314
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,680
because what it's doing is it's going

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
into a pool of liquidity

316
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,160
now we don't know with any

317
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
absolute assurity that what i'm going to

318
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,240
outline here

319
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,839
is going to unfold but i'm going to give

320
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,360
you the things you'd look for

321
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
to build confidence that it is likely to

322
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
and you'll see by going through your own

323
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
charts how fast you can see these

324
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
scenarios developing we're going to go

325
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
down to an hourly chart and study

326
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
this fractal where it goes below this

327
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
low here i'm going to release

328
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
information to you that would otherwise

329
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
not be shown on my youtube channel so

330
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
let's go over to the hourly chart now

331
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
all right see here is the hourly dollar

332
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
cad chart now right away it probably

333
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
doesn't look like much to you okay but

334
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
i'm gonna add annotations in a moment

335
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
but i want you to take a look at some of

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
the things without having any scribbles

337
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
any kind of

338
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
annotations or markings or labels on the

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
chart

340
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,959
just let me flesh it out for you a

341
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,920
little bit and then we'll throw the

342
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
lipstick on the chart

343
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,360
you should be able to see this high in

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,240
this low

345
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
as a important price range now what

346
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,399
makes it important

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
it's the most dominant price range in

348
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,079
this portion of price

349
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,200
action so whenever i'm looking at price

350
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
i look for clear discernible price

351
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
ranges

352
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
when the range is clearly defined as you

353
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,959
can see here

354
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
what i do is i want to look for

355
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
reference points

356
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,480
based on measurements that are very

357
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
generic okay so in other words i want to

358
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
know what this high is here

359
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
on this candle and i want to know what

360
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
the low of this candle is

361
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
now we're looking at this with the

362
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
expectation that

363
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
we're anticipating a run below that but

364
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
we don't know if it's going to continue

365
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
we wait for something to occur which

366
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
i'll outline here

367
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
and then once it happens it gives us

368
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,440
framework for short-term bias

369
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
and where the draw and liquidity is

370
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,040
going to be in an opposing order

371
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,680
in other words we see a an attack on

372
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
southside equity with this day here

373
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
if something occurs as i outline that

374
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,440
will be your

375
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
green light to anticipate opposing buy

376
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,680
side liquidity

377
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
to be taken okay so the concept i'm

378
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
showing you here

379
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
is purge and revert okay purge and

380
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,320
revert

381
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,279
all right so when we look at liquidity

382
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,880
you want to be able to look at it on the

383
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
basis of daily highs and lows

384
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
now when you look at daily highs and

385
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,839
lows you can add period separators to

386
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
your chart like tradingview.com allows

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,240
you to do

388
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
i'm not sure why it takes so long to

389
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
load up like that but there it is

390
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
but if you put the period separators on

391
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
trading view

392
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
this is the levels that you're going to

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,639
get now

394
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
i'm not going to argue that what i'm

395
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
going to show you use

396
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
better or that you can't use this either

397
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,600
i'm just teaching you the way i look at

398
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
it okay so if you're here on my channel

399
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
that more or less indicates that you're

400
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
interested

401
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
to see how i think about it may not

402
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
subscribe to everything i say

403
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
in fact i would count you not to do that

404
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
there's things i'm going to say in this

405
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
video and maybe in other videos

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,279
that will be offensive to you because

407
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,360
you are holding fast to your

408
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
your your logic your system your your

409
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
method and if it's profitable

410
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,519
don't allow me to change your mind about

411
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
something that may be working for you

412
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,680
but if you can take something from the

413
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
things i'm going to show you here and

414
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
glean

415
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
insight that may improve upon what

416
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,519
you're already doing

417
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
that's really my only intention here

418
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,639
okay but it

419
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,360
will be better if you could suspend all

420
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,320
of the previous

421
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,040
ideas that you have about price okay and

422
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,360
looking for things

423
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
i don't do it like this okay so what i

424
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
do is i look at the

425
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,399
midnight to midnight time frame and i

426
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,440
delineate my

427
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
session breaks like that so it'll look

428
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,519
like this

429
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,040
okay so all my vertical lines here are

430
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
midnight to midnight new york time

431
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,639
once this low which is highlighted

432
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
with this line here that's that old

433
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
daily low

434
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
and we see that run below that old daily

435
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,959
low here that is a

436
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,199
purging of liquidity now once this purge

437
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
occurs

438
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
we want to see the day of that purge we

439
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,120
want to start looking

440
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
backwards okay and other video series

441
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
and other videos and other commentaries

442
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,040
i've done

443
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
with forex and trading technical

444
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,519
analysis concepts and such

445
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,560
you'll hear this repeat

446
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,279
three days okay i use a three day range

447
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
of look back okay if you look for the

448
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
last three days

449
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
you'll have all the liquidity pools you

450
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,199
need to make money

451
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,000
you'll have all the liquidity pools to

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,480
target

453
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,240
for your trades you'll have all the

454
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
liquidity pools that you could use

455
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
for trade entries and you don't need

456
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,040
anything other than that

457
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,600
you don't need to have a ipta 20 day lit

458
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
look back period you don't need to have

459
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
a 60 day you don't need to have a

460
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
40 day you don't need to look back on

461
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
your weekly charts and see how many

462
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
times something hit a level

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
14 different times to have any faith in

464
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,639
it

465
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
the market does not look back 20 years

466
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
ago

467
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,480
the market does not look back five years

468
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,519
ago

469
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,519
okay it looks at predetermined price

470
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,639
levels

471
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,040
and that's the reason why the algorithms

472
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
operate the way they do

473
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
and what i mean by that for some of you

474
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,880
that are not technically inclined or

475
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,680
familiar with computer programming for

476
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
those that are this will make a lot of

477
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
sense to you but those that aren't

478
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
uh just bear with me for the folks that

479
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
are technically inclined

480
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
i'm not trying to talk down to those

481
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
individuals that aren't i'm just trying

482
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,199
to be

483
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
as inclusive as possible and

484
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
comprehensive so that way you understand

485
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,639
what i'm saying here

486
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
so it doesn't go right over your head

487
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
because i can clearly see

488
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,880
there's going to be a lot of people that

489
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
are going to be confused by this lesson

490
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,639
but if you just take it for what i'm

491
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,920
going to show you here and then go into

492
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,280
your own charts you'll see what i'm

493
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,000
referring to

494
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
and then it'll click so the day of the

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,240
purging

496
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,599
in other words the day it runs below

497
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
that old daily low

498
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,199
when that happens we count that as day

499
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
one okay that's day one of that event

500
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,480
of purging we wait

501
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
to see if it goes higher and reverts

502
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,039
not reverses okay i'm not saying

503
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,919
reversal

504
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
i'm saying revert what is it reverting

505
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
to it's reverting to

506
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
buy side so it draws to cell side

507
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
liquidity

508
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
and that's counted as day one that is

509
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,760
day one

510
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,559
day two day three that's our look back

511
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,400
on the day of liquidity purge

512
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
so the day it occurs you look back

513
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
three days now inside the range

514
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
prior to the liquidity purge you got to

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
look back and see where is that range

516
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
now you could have looked at this say if

517
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,559
you're looking at a 15-minute chart

518
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,240
maybe you would have seen it as

519
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
this high to this low and that's fine

520
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,520
there's nothing wrong with that you

521
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
would be just using five-minute charts

522
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
to get the same premise i'm showing you

523
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
here on an hourly chart

524
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,160
it's all scalable folks the things that

525
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,120
i teach

526
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,559
are very friendly to making it your own

527
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
i don't mean that by saying take my

528
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,360
content rename it and put a youtube

529
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,919
video up

530
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,440
okay that's not that's not what i'm

531
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
saying here what i'm saying is

532
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
it allows you the freedom and

533
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
flexibility because if the method

534
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,400
and concepts are legitimate it will

535
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,039
allow

536
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,440
anyone any number of people to come in

537
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
and form their own model and which

538
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,160
doesn't seem logical to a new trader or

539
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
someone that's a neophyte

540
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,799
someone coming to this for the first

541
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,440
time like it was for me

542
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,400
there only is one way of doing it

543
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
successfully and i've learned

544
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
it took me about six years to get there

545
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
but when i first started in 1992

546
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,000
it took me six years before i realized

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
that there isn't

548
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,559
one way to be profitable there is a

549
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,919
myriad of ways but there

550
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
are certain things that you need to

551
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,360
understand that puts the odds

552
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,000
more in your favor then if you didn't

553
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,960
know it

554
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
and the adversities that you have and

555
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
suffer through

556
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
are really avoidable okay you have to at

557
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,679
some point you have to admit that these

558
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,480
markets are

559
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
100 controlled they are you know we have

560
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
uh breakers in the marketplace that says

561
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
once it trades this much trading halts

562
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
for a little while

563
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
okay isn't that a measure of control

564
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
sure it is

565
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
and it's not limited to that they know

566
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
where these markets are going to go

567
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,320
they're

568
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,360
driven there okay and this is an example

569
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,600
of

570
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
engineered liquidity engineered

571
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,960
liquidity is where they run

572
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
down take those sellers out of the

573
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,799
marketplace for what purpose

574
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
it allows individuals that are on the

575
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,600
smart money side of things

576
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
informed traders okay large

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
institutional traders bank traders

578
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,640
and they will use that liquidity to be a

579
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
counterparty to their buying

580
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
so it is a way of looking at price and

581
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
saying okay

582
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,840
i don't need to have an overbought

583
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
oversold indicator i don't need to have

584
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
a divergence in an oscillator i don't

585
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,400
need to have harmonic

586
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
on my side i'm just looking at where

587
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,080
liquidity is

588
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,200
and if we see an old daily low taken

589
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,679
that is a significant pool of liquidity

590
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
there's lots of orders below an old low

591
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
like i indicated on the daily chart

592
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,400
before transitioning to the hourly but

593
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
this event where it goes below that low

594
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
it's being paired with smart money that

595
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,640
wants to buy now

596
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,919
right away some of you are looking at

597
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,240
well this is all hindsight i'm teaching

598
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
it through hindsight

599
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
but i promise if you go through your

600
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,919
charts the things i'm showing you here

601
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,480
they repeat over and over again which is

602
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
a basis for a model

603
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,760
this could be your unique trading model

604
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,080
and it's not really shown anywhere in

605
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,960
any of my content

606
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
i don't even teach this even in

607
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,320
mentorship what i'm showing you here

608
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
is fresh but it's using concepts that

609
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
i've touched on even in this free

610
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,320
youtube channel

611
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,640
and in my mentorship so i'm blending

612
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
both of

613
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,280
the worlds that are inside my mentorship

614
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
and outside i'm bringing them together

615
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
with something for free

616
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
right here so that way you can gain a

617
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,840
greater understanding of what the

618
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,520
markets are doing and why they're doing

619
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
it

620
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
if this is true if my assumption and my

621
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
argument that i pose to everyone that

622
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,480
comes to me

623
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
if these markets are not 100 manipulated

624
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,559
by an algorithm

625
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,840
then the things i'm going to show you

626
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,520
here won't hold up

627
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
if price runs below an old low that

628
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
sells liquidity has been purged

629
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,280
only if we start to move away from it

630
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,320
now it might be a sweep on stops

631
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,039
and then it continues higher but if it

632
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,559
runs below it and then

633
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,679
goes back above a specific level what

634
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,799
level would that be

635
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,159
but we want to look at the day that it

636
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
occurs and it runs the liquidity out

637
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,640
so this day here i've annotated the

638
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
daily high

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
if that high is traded to and through

640
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,559
that is a market structure break

641
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,159
only on the basis of a liquidity purge

642
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
now it does not mean it's 100 successful

643
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
it just means that

644
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
from an algorithmic standpoint if we're

645
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,200
looking at logical steps of

646
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,679
of processes we look for this if this

647
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,039
occurs then we look for this

648
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
if that occurs then we look for this and

649
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
if that occurs we look for that so it's

650
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
a matter of looking at

651
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,480
a recipe for a model

652
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
that would be unfolding dynamically so

653
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,240
if this

654
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,960
stays high when it takes the liquidity

655
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,679
it's broken

656
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
on the outside here i don't need it to

657
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,600
close above it

658
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
that's not i don't need that because the

659
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,720
narrative is

660
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,520
it ran below an old low for liquidity if

661
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
it's going to go higher

662
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
the algorithm will start its macro and

663
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
macro is a short order of

664
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,799
processes that begin and

665
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
go step by step and it's like a small

666
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
little

667
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,320
algorithm in a sense and the large

668
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
algorithm that creates and controls

669
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
price action

670
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
it's just a bunch of smaller little

671
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,880
algorithms that

672
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
tie together and it's very complex

673
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
obviously

674
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
but just know that you can reduce it to

675
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
something as simple as what i'm showing

676
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,000
you here it may not seem simple

677
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
right now because i'm a little wordy but

678
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
i need you to understand there's certain

679
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,760
things that are at play here that

680
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,880
cause these things okay that occur so

681
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,159
the run below the liquidity

682
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
if that day's high is broken we see it

683
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
here

684
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
then we can start looking for buy side

685
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,039
liquidity

686
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
for the algorithm to revert to here's

687
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,440
the previous day's high

688
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
that's all these little blind segments

689
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
are i'm looking at the daily high

690
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,320
that is between 12 and 12 midnight each

691
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
day

692
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
so this day's liquidity is tape

693
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,600
taken out but it's a break in market

694
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
structure

695
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,559
on the basis and narrative that we've

696
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
taken cell side liquidity out

697
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,559
so now once it does this where do we

698
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,080
anticipate price going to

699
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
well you first have to revert back to

700
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,679
this high

701
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
in this low so we're looking at how much

702
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,799
we're going to

703
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,760
retrace from this low into this high it

704
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
may not ever get back to that high and

705
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,880
here's the thing you don't need to have

706
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
it go there but you need to know where

707
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
the midpoint is

708
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
and that's what this level is here so

709
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
that's basically equilibrium

710
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,679
between the high and the low of that

711
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,200
obvious range

712
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
now the algorithm knows this range high

713
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
and it knows the low it forms here

714
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,039
the midpoint is equilibrium so what

715
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,279
we're doing is we want to look at

716
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,159
three days back as far as in terms of

717
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
time

718
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
the liquidity above the daily highs as

719
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,799
far back as day three

720
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,000
and the filter is the midpoint or

721
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
equilibrium of the range that it's

722
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
traded in prior to

723
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
the liquidity being purged now i already

724
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,520
know some of you

725
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
you know some of your ears are smoking

726
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
right now you're thinking man this is

727
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,559
too much

728
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
i need a trend line right now somebody

729
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,159
tossed me a moving average i say t is

730
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,559
killing me here

731
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
trust me okay when you watch this video

732
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,600
a few times

733
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
and go into your charts you'll see it

734
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,080
it's there but the range

735
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
needs to be filtered okay once we get to

736
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,400
the 50 point or 50

737
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,880
level of the high and the low that's all

738
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
i really use a fibonacci for folks

739
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,919
you know i'm just looking for

740
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
equilibrium and anything

741
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,320
at or above it in my mind is expensive

742
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,120
in other words it's a premium market so

743
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
it's going to require a whole lot more

744
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,159
for me to be a buyer

745
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,400
and many times it will negate me being a

746
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,440
buyer

747
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
but it will not disqualify

748
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,760
a long entry that i've maybe entered and

749
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,640
i did not so

750
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
we are clear now i didn't take a trade

751
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,360
on this i'm just showing you

752
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,159
conceptually

753
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
how you can study and see these things

754
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
going forward

755
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
but you can use these ideas

756
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,400
to frame the logic on holding

757
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,200
long positions or partials to get to

758
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
this level and then

759
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
day three in this case here so what i

760
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,320
mean by that we have the high

761
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
the low the logic behind the run on

762
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
stops on the sell side liquidity rate

763
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,960
okay so this is purged if we get a run

764
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,320
above the day of

765
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,799
the purging and then we start looking at

766
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,480
the previous day's highs

767
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,880
and above that is going to be liquidity

768
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
until we get to the 50

769
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,760
level of the range once it does that

770
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,080
we are in an iffy like it might not

771
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
continue going higher it could but it

772
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,880
might not

773
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
but if we have day three still in close

774
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
contention with this level in other

775
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
words it's not that far above it

776
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,679
and it's not a lot of range in terms of

777
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,159
where

778
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,520
the equilibrium is and where the

779
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,679
previous day or day three's

780
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,679
high would be that bicep equity would be

781
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,159
potentially attacked

782
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,200
so we can see each day on the

783
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,919
10th of november

784
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
we had the break above the old high here

785
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
market structure is broken so now we're

786
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,799
thinking buy side liquidity is going to

787
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
be the next draw

788
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,760
that means your bias on a short term is

789
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,960
look for this high to be tapped

790
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
and maybe this one we don't need to go

791
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,880
all the way back up here

792
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
okay we don't need to go all the way

793
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,600
back up to the last up closed candle

794
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,799
which is a bearish order block

795
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,880
okay you're looking at high probability

796
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,000
high probability

797
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
this is what this is high probability

798
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,240
short term trading

799
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,399
so if we see that they're all on bicep

800
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,440
liquidity is

801
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,279
the context that the algorithm is going

802
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,640
to be operating under

803
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,919
they've already done the damage guy

804
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
going down traders are going to be

805
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
looking for a continuation they're going

806
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,399
to be looking for

807
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,679
bear flags they're going to be looking

808
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,039
for bearish garlies they're going to be

809
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,240
looking for bearish

810
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,440
you know anything to get them short

811
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
and supply and demand traders are gonna

812
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
be looking for

813
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
supply zones to go short at

814
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
traders that use simple support

815
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
resistance levels are gonna be looking

816
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
at okay well we bounced here let's draw

817
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,919
that out in time

818
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,679
and it might sell off here and when it

819
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,880
starts to go down like that they get

820
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
really excited

821
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
you thinking like this are thinking well

822
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
we have a break in market structure

823
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
your eye goes here where their eyes

824
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,840
looking for this

825
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,520
level to be touched again because it's

826
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
support level

827
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,720
you see the paradigm shift that's taking

828
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
place already in a short little video

829
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,159
now this feels long for some of you

830
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
but it's a very short window of time

831
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,320
that i'm framing

832
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,200
a mode of logic that repeats all the

833
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,600
time

834
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,760
on all time frames but if we're going to

835
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,320
use it in this context using a look back

836
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,120
of three days

837
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,159
then it's framed on a daily chart and it

838
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,480
can be

839
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
reversed obviously if we're looking for

840
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,360
runs above old daily highs

841
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,320
but look back is three days equilibrium

842
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,960
is the

843
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,880
high the low split in the middle so all

844
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,399
i did was to get that level you put a

845
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,919
fibonacci on this high

846
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
to this low and whatever the 50 level is

847
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,159
you annotate that on your chart

848
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,360
so each day after this day you are

849
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
looking for

850
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,200
this pool of liquidity to be traded to

851
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,799
and this pool of liquidity to be traded

852
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,559
to once it does that

853
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,919
high probability goes away

854
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,720
it changes okay so the algorithm goes

855
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,360
into a

856
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,039
different mode of delivery it can become

857
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,840
a deeper retracement or it could

858
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
accelerate

859
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
into that high that's not what i'm going

860
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,960
to teach here i'm not teaching that that

861
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
and i know some of you are already say

862
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,159
say you're holding back

863
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,720
no it just requires a whole lot more to

864
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,440
teach and

865
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
i don't have the time for it and you

866
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
wouldn't want to sit through it anyway

867
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
so each day this high

868
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,679
you know being broken of this creates

869
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,520
the market structure shift

870
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
bisect liquidity here if we draw that

871
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
out in time

872
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,559
and we're going to draw this one out in

873
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,880
time

874
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,679
okay and

875
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,880
this one here because it's above the

876
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,159
three

877
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,840
and it's the last one so if we continue

878
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
with that bias you know we'll see if

879
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,640
there's any

880
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
continuation of that logic reaching for

881
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
both side liquidity

882
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,559
all right so now we have bicello cody

883
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,559
here bicello cody here

884
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,720
and by sell equity here and we're going

885
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
to look at

886
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,880
the 11th of november and we're going to

887
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,200
look at that on a

888
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
15 minute chart so let's drop down to

889
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,320
the 15 minute time frame and look at

890
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,960
this

891
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,279
here and how it attacks these blue

892
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,000
levels

893
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
all right so here is the 15 minute time

894
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
frame of that dollar cad

895
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,440
and we can see the short little lines

896
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
are always going to be

897
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,840
individual daily highs

898
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,640
the elongated blue lines are going to be

899
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,880
those old liquidity pools

900
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
that we're looking for price to trade up

901
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,919
into so

902
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,320
on the 11th we have price trading in

903
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,039
here

904
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,799
and again all i'm annotating here is

905
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,399
this candle's high

906
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,880
which makes that high we don't use the

907
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,120
the midnight high

908
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
when we're looking at all this data here

909
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,399
if this midnight candle

910
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,559
makes a higher high we don't call the

911
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
11th daily high that one

912
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,039
because it's really technically the 12th

913
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,760
so we're

914
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,120
using only the data that makes

915
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,840
the individual day prior to midnight in

916
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,880
new york time

917
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
so the highest high and the lowest low

918
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,159
that's what we're looking for

919
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,320
but as soon as we get to midnight

920
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,360
everything starts

921
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
new that's a new range for the day

922
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
so we have equilibrium here so we know

923
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,799
the price could jump to that

924
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,080
or at least this level here and this

925
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
level is the initial one because it's

926
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,159
below

927
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,159
equilibrium and it's the old liquidity

928
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,679
pool on day

929
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,360
two look at how price trades back down

930
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,799
in

931
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,760
to this run here isn't this an optimal

932
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
trade entry

933
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,320
watch here's your swing low

934
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,799
all right so here is the fibonacci laid

935
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,840
on that

936
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
price swing i'm using the bodies of the

937
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
candles again not using the wicks and

938
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
the tails because the bulk of the volume

939
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
is in the bodies

940
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,399
so it's going to give you a pure read on

941
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,240
where the buy signal is going to be

942
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
all right it doesn't mean that you can't

943
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,039
use the wicks and the tails it just

944
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,559
means when i'm looking for optimal trade

945
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,200
entry

946
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,880
i prefer to use the bodies of the

947
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
candles because it will give you a pure

948
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,120
read on the entry if i'm looking at

949
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,159
ranges

950
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,399
okay like when i outlined on the hourly

951
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,200
chart

952
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
and showed you where the high was and

953
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
the low was and then did the 50

954
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,159
when i'm looking at finding equilibrium

955
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
i will use

956
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
the wicks and the tails okay i get a lot

957
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,440
of questions you know by way of email

958
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
and people get confused

959
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,760
you know why does ict um use the wicks

960
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,799
and sometimes the bodies

961
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,799
he's not consistent it confuses me i

962
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,399
just answered that for you

963
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,960
okay the bodies are going to give me the

964
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,120
pure entry point

965
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,519
the wicks and the tails are used just

966
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,679
for measurement of ranges

967
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,039
okay so if i'm going to look for a

968
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,919
pattern of entry i'm using the bodies

969
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,919
if i'm looking for equilibrium

970
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,360
measurements

971
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,640
then it's always going to be wicks and

972
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
tails okay

973
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,320
when it comes to order blocks that's a

974
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,399
different theory which i won't touch on

975
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,200
here

976
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,919
but again take for what you get

977
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,039
so we have the optimal trade entry in

978
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,880
here trades down to that and we have a

979
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
standard deviation of

980
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
negative one-half and it overlaps

981
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
basically with that old liquidity pool

982
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
and then we have it trading up to

983
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
equilibrium here at negative one

984
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,760
we have negative two just above

985
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,600
the old liquidity pool and we have

986
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
negative 2.5

987
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,559
which is with this new liquidity pool on

988
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,159
thursday before friday's trading

989
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,559
and the market trades there on friday

990
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,399
and again we have price trading

991
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,440
down initially creating a judas swing

992
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
what's the context we're looking for

993
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,600
price to revert back to

994
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,519
buy side liquidity because it's already

995
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,320
done its job

996
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
over here running that old daily low so

997
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
each day we're looking for

998
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
clues if it's going to go to the buy

999
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
side equity each day it's going to be

1000
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,839
reaching for a specific

1001
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,000
level of liquidity it's not guess work

1002
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
it's very easily

1003
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,639
discerned what is the previous highs

1004
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,879
where above that high can price reach to

1005
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,399
then price will start they're stepping

1006
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,280
towards that

1007
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,520
it's not respecting trend lines it's not

1008
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,399
respecting

1009
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,320
patterns it's respecting where the

1010
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
liquidity is

1011
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,119
okay the market's going to go where

1012
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,760
there are orders it has no regard or

1013
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,719
respect for

1014
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,760
anybody's trading pattern okay the

1015
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,639
market's gonna go

1016
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,599
where there is counterparty period and

1017
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
if there isn't enough counterparty there

1018
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,599
the market will create it it'll engineer

1019
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,239
it

1020
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,879
it'll run up blow out equal highs it'll

1021
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,520
blow out

1022
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,000
equal lows and it'll change sentiment on

1023
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,320
the basis of that event

1024
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
here we have the market trading above

1025
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
the equilibrium trading to an old

1026
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
liquidity pool and trades back down

1027
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,040
now we still have time in the week

1028
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,520
and it can still continue but isn't this

1029
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,280
an optimal trade entry as well

1030
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,640
and a breaker we have a

1031
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,240
low a high a lower low use the highest

1032
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,720
up close candle

1033
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,160
i'm just adding this in here just for

1034
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,800
bonus no extra charge

1035
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
we have the body right there so when the

1036
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,119
market trades down into that

1037
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,839
that's your bullish breaker and your

1038
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,280
order block

1039
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
down close candle before this

1040
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,359
displacement optimal trade entry

1041
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,400
we'll add that again watch what i'm

1042
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
doing i'm putting it on the bodies

1043
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,640
we get above thursday's liquidity pool

1044
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,320
here not by much

1045
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
but we have a standard deviation of

1046
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
negative one that with these

1047
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
equal highs here or relative equal highs

1048
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
we could potentially see it

1049
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
try to get up and snag that i'm not

1050
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,560
saying it will

1051
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
because we're above equilibrium but that

1052
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,560
is how i would look at it now if this

1053
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,839
was say

1054
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,800
say this was tuesday wednesday and we

1055
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
were still in an active trading week

1056
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,640
that i would still be hunting longs and

1057
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
i would look for a standard deviation

1058
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,280
of negative one or negative one and a

1059
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,000
half

1060
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
because it would be expanding above the

1061
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
relative equal highs

1062
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
and i would look for it for like 10 20

1063
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
30 pips and i would look for that type

1064
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,119
of thing to occur and try to attack that

1065
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
132 big figure

1066
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
that is not an analysis i'm just saying

1067
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
that that's how i would use it if it

1068
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,119
were

1069
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,280
you know still in an active trading week

1070
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,599
now what am i showcasing here

1071
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,200
am i just talking about hindsight and

1072
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,520
just trying to dazzle you with something

1073
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,599
that's obvious in the charts

1074
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,880
some of you might come away from this

1075
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,960
video with that opinion and you're free

1076
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,079
to have that

1077
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,079
but those individuals that go into the

1078
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,599
charts and start looking at what i'm

1079
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,720
showing here

1080
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,400
is simplest short overview of what i

1081
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,760
just did here

1082
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,119
you look for areas in the marketplace

1083
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,839
with old highs and old lows and if the

1084
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,839
market trades down below it

1085
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
wait to see if it wants to break the day

1086
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
it trades below it in other words

1087
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,320
this is the event day if it trades above

1088
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,079
that then we potentially have a market

1089
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
structure shift

1090
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,480
so we start looking for previous day's

1091
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,839
highs and the liquidity that will be

1092
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,240
resting above it

1093
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,760
previous days high with liquidity

1094
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
resting above it you are not

1095
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,599
looking back three days every time a new

1096
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,440
day comes back and then finding that we

1097
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
are looking at

1098
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,280
three days back counting day one of the

1099
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
purge on liquidity

1100
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,280
that is how the algorithm reads it how

1101
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
does it select which day michael if

1102
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,160
there's an algorithm how to do it

1103
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,839
i'm telling you this is one of the ways

1104
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,359
that it does it it

1105
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,520
looks back three days now why three days

1106
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
you're probably asking why is it three

1107
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,560
days ict

1108
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,320
well there is classically there is a

1109
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,760
and i have to show it to you like this

1110
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
if you're looking at a chart

1111
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
and

1112
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,440
we're looking at an old low

1113
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,280
i teach this and this is really this is

1114
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,640
a fundamental

1115
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
truth that if you look at most turning

1116
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
points in the marketplace

1117
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,720
you see some kind of

1118
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,960
depiction of turning point like this in

1119
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,000
price this would be like

1120
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
a swing low now if you're using things

1121
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,560
like with mt4 they have a

1122
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,599
a fractal indicator i don't i'm not i've

1123
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,800
never been a fan of that and even if you

1124
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,160
look back at the stuff i did when i

1125
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,359
stepped out on the stage

1126
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,800
just to teach on forex in 2010

1127
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
i went against that whole mt4 fractal

1128
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
indicator because

1129
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,079
it requires five candles and five

1130
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,359
candles

1131
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,359
good grief the move is already done

1132
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,720
we're anticipating

1133
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,800
the lowest candle to go into something

1134
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,079
like this generally

1135
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
that's how i take as i teach it there's

1136
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
something down there we're anticipating

1137
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,880
the next candle if it has a higher low

1138
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,400
right away that's the turning point for

1139
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,520
me

1140
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,640
so we look back three days because

1141
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,760
this event like it does here when it

1142
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,960
runs below that old daily low that's

1143
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
indicated by this line here

1144
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,920
when that occurs it might not just be a

1145
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
one day event it might be

1146
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,440
a two day event where it goes even

1147
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,640
deeper so

1148
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
when it creates that we count that as

1149
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,839
day one

1150
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,320
two and three and we identify that

1151
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,040
liquidity

1152
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,720
on those days if it

1153
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,760
goes lower i'm still going to refer

1154
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
back to the original day three it just

1155
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
gives us one more day of potential

1156
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,480
liquidity it may reach for

1157
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
but it's three day on the basis that it

1158
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,960
creates turning points and just like

1159
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
everything else i teach if you just

1160
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,240
reverse it and put this here

1161
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,359
the swing highs form generally like

1162
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,920
this we have a high a higher high and a

1163
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
candle that has a lower high

1164
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,760
now this candle's high might be lower

1165
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,119
than this candle's high or it could be

1166
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
higher the real point is that there's a

1167
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,560
candle that has a lower high to the left

1168
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
a lower high to the right and that's

1169
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
usually a classic swing high

1170
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,040
swing low again has a higher low to the

1171
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,119
left a higher low to the right

1172
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,760
and this could be a higher low than this

1173
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
candle or it could be

1174
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,760
lower it doesn't that's not what we're

1175
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,480
really

1176
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
pressing here there is logic behind what

1177
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,000
i'm showing you here you can

1178
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
use other things for that which is a

1179
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,760
completely different lesson but for just

1180
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
a classification of a swing high swing

1181
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,599
low for turning point basis

1182
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,920
this is what it graphically looks like

1183
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
most times it doesn't always you know

1184
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
appear like that

1185
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,119
but on most cases it does look like that

1186
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,800
and that's the reason why the logic is

1187
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,440
three days because the turning points

1188
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,240
generally form

1189
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,560
with that type of structure all right so

1190
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,200
your job your homework going forward

1191
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,000
using this

1192
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,319
information is to see how the market

1193
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,839
reaches for liquidity i get a lot of

1194
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,200
questions all the time how do you know

1195
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,760
what

1196
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
side of the market to trade on because

1197
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,960
if i could do that ict if you could just

1198
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,560
teach me how

1199
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,400
to learn to be a buyer or seller is it

1200
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,079
going to be an update or a down day

1201
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,760
i will be profitable and i'm going to

1202
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
tell you you're not correct in thinking

1203
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,480
that

1204
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,680
because there's other things that's

1205
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,200
going to get in the way when you think

1206
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
you've scratched that itch then you'll

1207
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,640
have 20 more that says well ict talks

1208
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,920
about the candles and the wicks and then

1209
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,440
you'll argue about that

1210
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
when what i just gave you here did i

1211
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,000
bring in commitment traders reports

1212
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,319
no did i bring in the traders trinity

1213
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,079
which i don't even look at anymore

1214
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,280
no did i talk about pivot points no

1215
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,319
mitigation blocks nope did i teach

1216
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,640
catapult whiplash nope

1217
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,480
there's lots of different patterns and

1218
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
there's lots of different ways that you

1219
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,000
can take small little samplings of the

1220
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
things i teach

1221
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,280
with the proper context and narrative

1222
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
and it becomes a complete model

1223
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,440
you need to look at all of these days

1224
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,839
here with the times of day that i teach

1225
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,680
which is the london open kill zone the

1226
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,240
new york open kill zone close kill zone

1227
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,800
and look how these patterns form there's

1228
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,480
optimal trade entries in these

1229
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,040
days based on the logic that it's going

1230
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,280
to reach for the liquidity above here

1231
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
and here period

1232
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,000
it's structured it's not contrived

1233
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,599
it's not form-fitted because if you go

1234
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,000
back and look at every other event and

1235
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
here's the other thing reverse it and

1236
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,119
look at how the market does when it

1237
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,000
trades

1238
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,680
above old highs but here's the thing

1239
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
you're going to if you are going into

1240
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,880
this to find

1241
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,680
times where it fails okay if that's what

1242
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
you're trying to do right away

1243
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
you're going to miss the lessons that

1244
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,960
it's going to show you

1245
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,839
by doing it with the investigative

1246
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,200
approach in other words

1247
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,680
does it show this logic because in

1248
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,319
future lessons i'll touch on this again

1249
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,960
and it'll be on my youtube channel but

1250
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,160
you need to first see

1251
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,040
this okay anything i mean i can look at

1252
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
my order block theory

1253
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,480
and go in and find 50 examples where it

1254
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,839
would be viewed as

1255
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,760
failing if you just look at it from the

1256
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,680
perspective that youtube people

1257
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,800
put up videos and they think they

1258
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,119
understand my order block theory no

1259
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,359
it's not complete my mentorship has not

1260
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,520
exhausted that

1261
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,319
you you can always torture the data and

1262
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,359
if you manipulate

1263
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,520
you know hard and fast and long long

1264
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,800
enough it will

1265
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,839
confess to anything but there has to be

1266
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,040
a logic

1267
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,240
in play so let's go back in closing take

1268
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,000
everything off and go to a daily chart

1269
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
the market has consolidated for a long

1270
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,599
period of time in here

1271
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,839
and we have this old low when the market

1272
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,119
drives down below that

1273
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
i don't care if it's going to go up a

1274
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,880
little bit and then

1275
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
continue going lower because that's not

1276
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,920
a

1277
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,200
model i'm trying to frame here i'm not

1278
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,800
teaching you long-term trading i'm

1279
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,560
teaching you a short-term way of

1280
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,520
determining

1281
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,200
where the next draw on liquidity is

1282
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
going to be is it going to be

1283
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,119
aiming for the buy side or the sell side

1284
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,000
now there are

1285
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,040
other ways to discern whether

1286
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
buy sides going to be attacked or sell

1287
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,359
side liquidity it's going to be attacked

1288
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,800
and that might be your model but they

1289
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,760
all going to lean

1290
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,400
on general principles that are generic

1291
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,839
and that means when we have a period

1292
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,359
like this in consolidation

1293
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,599
this old low if it runs below that even

1294
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,680
if it will go lower

1295
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
and i'm not saying it will or won't here

1296
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,839
i'm just saying if it does or if it will

1297
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,720
or if it's more inclined to do so

1298
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,960
all we're doing is looking at short-term

1299
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,839
liquidity

1300
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,720
to frame short-term intraday trades

1301
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,599
that's all i'm

1302
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,839
i'm posing that as a study on liquidity

1303
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:00,640
here

1304
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,839
so i framed it on the basis

1305
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,599
higher time frame liquidity pools which

1306
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,000
is sell side here

1307
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
short-term trading logic algorithmic

1308
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
principles understanding the open float

1309
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,720
where the market's gonna attack a

1310
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,880
specific side of the marketplace

1311
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
until it gets to a specific threshold

1312
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,520
and then it becomes low probability

1313
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,680
now obviously if it trades higher and

1314
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,640
goes more

1315
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,640
higher than i've outlined on that lower

1316
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,240
time frame

1317
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
then that's a model outside the scope of

1318
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,319
what i'm showing you here

1319
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,160
it does not reduce its effectiveness

1320
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,240
here it does not mean that this is any

1321
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,280
less

1322
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,079
of a model and that longer term or enemy

1323
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,680
term trading is better

1324
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,880
it just means which would resonate more

1325
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
with you as the individual because i'm

1326
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,280
talking in a way that it allows the

1327
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,119
flexibility of the reader and viewer of

1328
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,720
my videos to see

1329
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,119
if it resonates with them if it doesn't

1330
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,880
i'm not offended

1331
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
no mentor should be offended because the

1332
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,079
mentor should know that

1333
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,720
everything isn't always going to fall in

1334
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,560
the expectations and alignment

1335
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,520
with everybody's psychological makeup

1336
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,119
you aren't always going to agree with

1337
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,079
everything i say

1338
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,480
and the weak-minded individuals that

1339
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,280
come here

1340
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,680
and they are met with something that is

1341
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,319
against

1342
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,560
the grain of what they believe in they

1343
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,480
just quickly dismiss the entire channel

1344
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:20,960
and they

1345
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,599
really dismiss the likelihood of

1346
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,040
potentially picking up on some really

1347
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,480
amazing things

1348
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,200
for free that may make them a stronger

1349
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,920
trader

1350
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,760
the ones that come here and they say

1351
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,440
okay that doesn't really resonate with

1352
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,000
me but

1353
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,839
they go into their journal and say all

1354
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,160
right ict mentioned this this this and

1355
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,680
here's my concerns about that

1356
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,960
and why i don't feel any gravitation

1357
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
towards that at the moment

1358
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,920
so it's not killing the idea it just

1359
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,960
means that you have

1360
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
observed something you've recorded your

1361
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,000
observation

1362
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,440
and you kept an open mind about it

1363
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,359
because something else in the future

1364
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,720
that you may come in

1365
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,880
contact with with this video or maybe

1366
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
you're joining a mentorship maybe you're

1367
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,839
not i don't care

1368
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,440
but you'll come in contact with another

1369
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,200
lesson that it will say

1370
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,680
oh that makes sense because i remember

1371
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,720
him talking about this

1372
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
other concept or this principle and how

1373
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,480
the markets deliver price

1374
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,240
and then it becomes a complete

1375
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,920
understanding about something that you

1376
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,520
immediately dismissed initially so

1377
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,800
always have an open mind don't be

1378
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
you closed-minded to the idea of

1379
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,920
learning something that may be

1380
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,040
uncomfortable at first

1381
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,920
or it may feel too dry like this lesson

1382
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,000
could be viewed as this is really boring

1383
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,440
you know you could have said this in in

1384
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,520
five minutes yeah i could have said

1385
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,280
if the liquidity is taken below the old

1386
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,359
low look back three days and see if it

1387
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,880
goes to the bicep liquidity but that

1388
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,960
does not frame all the necessary logic

1389
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
that i gave you in this video

1390
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,280
okay try to try to reduce it down to

1391
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,280
what you think it should be said

1392
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,520
and then also lean on the things that

1393
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
i've also outlined here that were

1394
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,760
important in terms of thresholds what

1395
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,680
logic needs to take place

1396
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
and understand also that you may have

1397
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,760
been

1398
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,359
able to watch other videos and you're

1399
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,119
more versed in the things that i've

1400
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,000
talked about in old

1401
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,040
videos and that's usually what happens

1402
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,079
people come they watch the videos and

1403
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,599
they are highly opinionated because they

1404
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,839
want to get to the next new stuff

1405
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,920
but there are always new people coming

1406
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,640
in and if i talk about something

1407
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,760
i get waves of emails if they're new so

1408
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,280
i always like to try to

1409
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
sprinkle this within my videos that say

1410
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,400
look you know you're not going to learn

1411
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,599
this in one video and i can't

1412
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,960
encapsulate everything in one video

1413
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,400
because there's a lot of other

1414
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,359
subject matter that these things lean on

1415
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,520
but i tried to reduce it to something

1416
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,880
that is

1417
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,680
scalable you can see it understand it

1418
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,040
the logic the things that the only

1419
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,800
moving parts is what i showed you here

1420
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
like i said i didn't require all the

1421
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,480
other things that i know

1422
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,800
and that you all have learned from me

1423
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,160
you don't need all those things

1424
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,280
and if you have a price action model you

1425
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,599
the

1426
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,359
the best price action models are the

1427
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,280
ones that can be reduced to the

1428
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,520
back of a business card okay i actually

1429
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,559
did this on

1430
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,640
baby pips when i was active on their

1431
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,079
forum

1432
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,400
i did an article and it was uh here's my

1433
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,359
business card

1434
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,800
and i basically said you know you may

1435
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,000
have a lot of understanding about price

1436
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,599
and i believe i do and i believe my

1437
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,040
students do but

1438
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,640
those that are profitable can reduce the

1439
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,359
idea

1440
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,680
that they would use to frame a setup

1441
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,880
from beginning to end

1442
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,359
with money management and everything it

1443
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,040
could be reduced and written out on the

1444
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,640
back of a business card now my question

1445
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,000
to you is

1446
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,920
do you have it in your mind that

1447
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,040
learning here

1448
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,280
is going to require you more information

1449
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,640
that you cannot fit on the back of a

1450
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,680
business card

1451
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,359
because if that's what your expectation

1452
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,520
is if that's what you're afraid of

1453
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
by delving into this youtube channel or

1454
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,680
even my mentorship

1455
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,400
don't let that be a thing that is a

1456
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,119
problem

1457
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,760
it's not it's that's a normal fear and

1458
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,480
concern

1459
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,119
because there's a lot of information but

1460
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,200
think of it like this

1461
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
if you're going to be a doctor you have

1462
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
to learn a lot about things

1463
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,119
in the body that may not be your

1464
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,240
specialty

1465
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,480
when you start practicing medicine you

1466
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,559
may be a foot doctor or a hand doctor

1467
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,160
but you had to learn about the skeletal

1468
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,200
system

1469
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,280
on this on the cranium you know the

1470
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,240
clavicle

1471
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,720
you had to understand you know the

1472
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,200
patella the kneecap all these things

1473
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,400
they're not specific to the foot

1474
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,680
in the sense that anatomically

1475
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,680
that's the area that you're studying but

1476
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,880
something that is occurring in the knee

1477
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,079
may be a real reason or root cause of

1478
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,319
the problem you're having in your foot

1479
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,680
so when i teach i teach

1480
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
an all-encompassing approach because i

1481
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,839
don't want any weaknesses

1482
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,160
at all so i don't want anyone to think

1483
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,920
that

1484
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,520
coming here with all the information

1485
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,640
that's available to you that you're

1486
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,920
going to drown in the information and

1487
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,400
come out

1488
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,440
with nothing because

1489
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,599
you we could sit down here every single

1490
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,040
week and put

1491
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,079
one principal you know

1492
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,520
on the back of a business card and say

1493
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
here is a trading model and this is all

1494
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,480
you need to do

1495
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,160
don't do anything outside of this you

1496
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,680
won't get a trade every day

1497
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,200
and that's also a problem you're going

1498
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,960
to have people that want to have a trade

1499
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,640
every single day

1500
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,480
and if that's the case then you're a

1501
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,920
scalper at heart you want to be a

1502
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,640
scalper

1503
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,640
okay then focus on trading time of day

1504
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,960
with the logic i showed you here

1505
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,240
principles like this

1506
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,319
where you need to know how the market is

1507
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,000
going to draw on

1508
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,400
buy side or sell side and that gives

1509
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,079
your internal

1510
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,280
intraday bias should you be buying and

1511
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,079
selling

1512
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,520
you don't care how the week is going to

1513
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,280
close you don't care what the trend is

1514
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,559
going to be over the next four days or

1515
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,440
the next three days

1516
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,680
what's the daily range going to expand

1517
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,359
in direction higher or lower

1518
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,680
that's all scalper cares about and you

1519
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,440
can make money doing that

1520
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,200
you don't you can make money doing that

1521
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,359
that would be opposed to the long term

1522
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,960
downtrend or uptrend on a daily chart

1523
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,880
and weekly chart monthly chart

1524
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,079
because it's scalping so when you have

1525
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,760
these questions or concerns or if you

1526
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,200
read other people's opinions

1527
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,559
or watch their review videos and such

1528
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,160
they are entitled to their opinion they

1529
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,000
all have their own

1530
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,160
view on me and other people and that's

1531
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,000
fine they're welcome to it but it

1532
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,280
doesn't change or

1533
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
reduce the effectiveness of the things

1534
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,960
that i teach or that you learn here

1535
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,240
okay so you have to be balanced about it

1536
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,319
and go into it with a proper mindset and

1537
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,760
i've given you a structure here to go in

1538
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,440
and start studying and you'll see

1539
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,280
that these things repeat and as far as

1540
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,440
intraday scalping

1541
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,920
intraday short-term trading this is one

1542
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,760
of those little dandies that repeat

1543
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
a lot but you have to have the context

1544
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,000
of where the market runs at liquidity on

1545
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,680
a higher time frame chart

1546
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,079
until thanks language good luck and good

1547
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,079
trading
