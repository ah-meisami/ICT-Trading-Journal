Case study 
As i say before
When we see price goes to the imbalance such as fvg sibi bisi etc
You  maybe see Change in state of delivery (CSD)
 if that array works 
Right there with CSD maybe reversal .
But attention folks
Imbalances... order blocks..etc PD arrays
Are in the internal range ðŸ‘ˆ
The frame work is 
External range to external range

So 

If the pd arrays working
It show's there's dol before that 
And liquidity already taken
And price is going to delivery on the other side
Now where we are? 
We are in internal range
And if mkake swing point 
This swing point is in internal range
& In the next retracement after price delivery on the other side maybe violated ðŸ‘ˆ
Attention
If you don't know where is liquidity
You are liquidity ðŸ‘ˆ
So dont use swing points in imbalances & other pd arrays
As impulse point
