ALGO Market Structure
====================================================================================
TLQ = Transactional Liquidity => correction
SLQ = Structural Liquidity => => continuation
ILQ = Transactional Liquidity => expansion

SLQ : LLBML = Last Low Before The Min Low
SLQ : LHBMH = Last High Before The Min High

--------------------------

VTL = Valid Trading Leg
FBOS = Fake Break Of Structure
TBOS = True Break Of Structure

Bullish Structural Points = Higher High : HH , Higher Low : HL
Bearish Structural Points = Lower High : LH , Lower Low : LL

HTF = is like going from a big city to another big city
LTF = is like going from a small town to another small a small towns exist between big cities.

Indirect Pullback = 
    wa have a new Structural Points Below\Above VTL, 
    before hitting the last inefficiency exist inside VTL.

Direct Pullback = 
    there is not new Structural Points Below\Above VTL, 
    2. after hitting the TBOS price goes back and hits the last inefficiency exist inside VTL.

-- ONLY if there is a Direct Pullback we are allowed to Direct Sell

TLQ = Transactional Liquidity => correction :: In (bullish \ bearish) markets exists (above \ below)  (HH \ LL)
ILQ = Transactional Liquidity => expansion :: In (bullish \ bearish) markets exists (below \ above)  (HL \ LH)
SLQ = Structural Liquidity => => continuation ::  In (bullish \ bearish) markets exists (above \ below)  (HL \ LH)

[01:14] IMPORTANT
When Price Takes the ERL the next ILQ is not inside Internal Push (Substructure)

[01:18] IMPORTANT
- Can I sell from SLQ directly !? 
- No
- Why !?
- Because there is ILQ above\below it.

- How I can sell directly from SLQ  !? 
- 1. Understanding EPA in terms of Equilibrium 
- 2. Understanding TOM

SS = Supply (my-thoughts = HTF Premium PDAs)
DD = Demand (my-thoughts = HTF Discount PDAs)

Price Behaviour : is into or on SS/DD (my-thoughts = BIAS)
Price Delivery  : is away from SS/DD (my-thoughts = NARRATIVE)
