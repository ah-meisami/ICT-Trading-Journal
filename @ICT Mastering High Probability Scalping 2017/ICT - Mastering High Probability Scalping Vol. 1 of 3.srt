1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,090
now hooks welcome to volume one of three

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,670
for mastering high probability scalping

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,830
now this is a video that's going to be

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,510
kept on my youtube channel and generally

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,579
anything that's predominantly linked to

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,720
just my youtube channel will have this

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,300
intro and I'm going to ask you as the

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,270
trading community to help me out a lot

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,570
of times folks will take my content and

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,620
re-upload it on their own YouTube

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,650
channel and if you see that just let me

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,300
know and I'd like to be able have that

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,190
taken down I put the work into these

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,050
presentations so I'd like to be able to

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,190
get to credit and the benefit of edie

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,450

so if you see it just let me know and I

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,860

public about you can send me an email

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,330
that inner circle trader at gmail.com I

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,619
greatly appreciate it thanks

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,500
all right so before we can I'm gonna ask

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,020
you a question what is high probability

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,900
scalps every one of us would have a

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,610
different definition I'm certain of it

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,050
but for me as I CT it's ten to thirty

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,080
pip price wings now I don't do a lot of

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,300
this type of trading it's only recently

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,310
because I've come back online and it

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,170
gives me an opportunity to give a lot of

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,350
set ups a lot of results a lot of things

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,940
to study I guess it's you know probably

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,259
one of the easiest things that get

34
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,539
people excited and I know that going in

35
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,369
and that's the reason why I adopted this

36
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,430
style of showcasing my talents but I

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,710
don't want you to think this is the only

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,630
way you can trade the markets because

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,009
it's not there's certainly ways you can

40
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,590
do it front end the day standpoint but I

41
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,860
want you to know that what I teach has

42
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,470
consistency and it also has the ability

43
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,220
to prove right away that the markets are

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,410
not in fact random at all they're very

45
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,140
very organized they're very specific

46
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,730
about where they're trying to get to

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,519
intraday and even on a weekly basis and

48
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,250
I would probably argue the point on even

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,730
longer term basis but I just haven't

50
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,250
made my precision that long term yet I

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,320
don't think I ever will first thing it's

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,040
not my cup of tea

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,510
I like day trading and short-term

54
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,190
trading one shot one kills what I'm

55
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,079
known for which is trading the weekly

56
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,570
range so daily highs and lows are my

57
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,140
specialty

58
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,940
and weekly highs and lows are my

59
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,739
specialty so I try to trade inside those

60
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,230
ranges and I get the meet or hopefully

61
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,180
the meet of the move not trying to get

62
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,100
the very high or very low but I know

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,870
where those parameters are and as long

64
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,700
as I haven't met those extremes I know I

65
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
have opportunity or life in the battery

66
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,650
if you will all right so we're gonna be

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,690
focus on specific things in this

68
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,070
presentation it's not going to be very

69
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,840
long I want to keep them concise and

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,850
short and again it's three volumes so if

71
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,739
any questions come up by why you're

72
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,260
watching this it's important every time

73
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,459
you watch any of my videos have a

74
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,920
notepad in hand turn the radio off go

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,780
into a quiet room listen to what I'm

76
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,760
saying because I'm packing 20 plus years

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,299
of information and experience and very

78
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,110
very small bandwidth so

79
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,880
just write down your questions I'm quite

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,500
certain there's going to be able to find

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,960
the answers to them in future

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,450
presentations for this one we're we

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,830
highlighting the many opportunities in

84
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,590
scalping the Forex

85
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm gonna be teaching you how to learn

86
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,980
directional bias for higher timeframe

87
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,450
institutional sponsorship and I'll

88
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,709
explain what that is when we get to it

89
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,379
and how to determine the highest

90
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,520
probable times of the day trade

91
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,930
and we're gonna be learning how to frame

92
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,090
high probability setups for runs on

93
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,250
liquidity sounds pretty fancy I know

94
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,880
alright so high probability scalping now

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,830
this is an example of a high probability

96
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,760
scalp and this is in the dollar cad now

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
right away some of you are gonna be

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,860
watching this video

99
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,630
months and years from the time actually

100
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,970
presented it trust me

101
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,320
I tweeted live and people watched this

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,839
actually be shown to them live ok this

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,180
actually was a weekly high at the time

104
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,430
of this presentation but I was calling

105
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,210
them a weekly and daily high looking at

106
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,760
this specific range everything that's in

107
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,330
here is all that is necessary to know

108
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,910
how to do short-term scalping intraday

109
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,760
now because it's scalping there's gonna

110
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,640
be times when these setups overlap with

111
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,610
longer-term conditions now I'm not

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,320
teaching one shot one kill here I'm not

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,150
teaching swing trading or position

114
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,640
trading but I will drop that little

115
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,320
nugget for you to study

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,470
it's obviously found in my free

117
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,720
tutorials you can find that on my

118
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,300
website about inner circle trader.com is

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
a free form you can join that it's

120
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,540
absolutely free to get in there and you

121
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,640
can watch all my pre tutorials that I'm

122
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,920
releasing and you also be able to see

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,220
some things I share in trading journal

124
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,700
entry so you can give me an opportunity

125
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,830
to speak to you by way of how I

126
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,960
interpret and reflect on what has been

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,730
seen in the marketplace when I take

128
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,800
action or if I take action and I lose

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,780
you kind of get a vibe on what it is

130
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,390
I've either felt or what I was thinking

131
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,710
during the day when I was looking at the

132
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,200
marketplace but a short term scalp here

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,790
is a very simple approach to running out

134
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,410
previous day's highs or previous day's

135
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,160
loads that's all it is we're targeting

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,840
by stops above the previous day's high

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,710
or a day or two ago in other words we're

138
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,910
always gonna be looking back the last

139
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,160
three days okay that's your there's your

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
range okay you're gonna be looking back

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,580
at the highest high and the lowest low

142
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,050
in the last three days now you're

143
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,560
counting today as they want so for

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,580
instance at the time that's recording

145
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,340
day of the week is Thursday so we would

146
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,780
be looking at Wednesday's data and

147
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,110
Tuesday's data very easy rules right so

148
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,460
we know what the daily high and the low

149
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,419
is on Tuesday and on Wednesday and we're

150
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,280
monitoring what's going on intraday for

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,750
today that would be Thursday of the time

152
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,550
that's recording in November 2nd of 2017

153
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,960
now what we're aiming for is exactly how

154
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,810
banc traders trade now I know a lot of

155
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,849
folks on YouTube claimed to know certain

156
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,789
things and they use a lot of buzzwords

157
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,259
but I'm going to show you something that

158
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,270
no one else teaches because they don't

159
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,639
know it ok but I'm going to show you in

160
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,190
recent weeks since I've been back on

161
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,710
social media everyone's noticing a tone

162
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,199
or difference in my presentation it's a

163
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,180
lot more concise a lot more accurate a

164
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,029
lot more specific in nature and that's

165
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,969
because I've spent the last 14 months

166
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,680
with people on a day-by-day basis and

167
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,879
I've been able to share with them

168
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,069
they're really openly about what I've

169
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,060
learned over the last 24 plus years and

170
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,090
it's not retail retail things get you

171
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,590
into this business I'm gonna show you

172
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,389
how to leave that stuff behind you and

173
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,300
think institutionally that's like my

174
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,669
tagline now I want everyone that follows

175
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,400
me to leave that retail mindset because

176
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,529
it's not going to help you in fact it's

177
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,779
actually gonna be a hindrance or snare

178
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,969
you're gonna find yourself not finding

179
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,229
consistency at all and if you ask

180
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,719
yourself right now are you consistent if

181
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,860
you're following retail stuff you're

182
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,409
probably not using the things I'm gonna

183
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,449
teach you in this 3 volumes you will

184
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,240
quickly find consistency now I did not

185
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,789
say profitability I cannot promise that

186
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,979
some of you are going to break the rules

187
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,449
where you gonna do things early so

188
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,219
you're gonna do things late you're gonna

189
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,349
risk too much okay and you're gonna do

190
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,629
too many things at one time

191
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,159
that's what's gonna cause the adverse

192
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,900
effect and I don't want the credit for

193
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,699
your wins and I don't want to credit for

194
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,610
your losses so be responsible it's only

195
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,930
for informational purposes only

196
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,900
all right so when we look at high

197
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,850
probability scalping now this is an

198
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,670
hourly chart on the dollar cad and what

199
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,260
I've done is I've highlighted the

200
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,630
individual daily highs and lows now it's

201
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,540
important that from a scalping

202
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,280
standpoint your time frame you're gonna

203
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,650
be following Mon mostly is gonna be on

204
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,420
the daily because it's gonna give you a

205
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,680
bias and I'll show you how to do that

206
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,250
it's really simple but for looking for

207
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,740
liquidity you're gonna be using the

208
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,870
hourly chart because it gives us a real

209
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,120
nice framework to see where previous

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,030
day's high is or the previous high two

211
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,880
days ago okay for instance right now at

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,830
the time of this recording right over

213
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,289
here this is Thursday's data in the far

214
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,300
right of the chart okay and yesterday's

215
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,010
Wednesday's data you can see the low

216
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,020
it's been highlighted here and the high

217
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,830
and then Tuesday's high and low okay so

218
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,120
I want to draw your attention to the

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,390
fact that we have traded below

220
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,760
Wednesday's low today and we've also now

221
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,460
traded below Tuesday's low so that to me

222
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,230
is a significant point I'll talk more

223
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,390
about that in volume two but I want to

224
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,890
kind of like bring your attention to it

225
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,210
right now because it's going to be

226
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,100
salient to what we see going into

227
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,170
tomorrow's trading okay and you'll see

228
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,940
all that in hindsight but I'm drawing

229
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,520
your attention to it right now but each

230
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,460
day daily highs and lows okay when it's

231
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,140
bullish when the market is bullish and

232
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,310
I'll show you how to define what's

233
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,550
bullish and what's bearish not requiring

234
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,920
any indicators no trend lines and moving

235
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,970
average and the oscillator none of that

236
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,840
stuff okay

237
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,140
just using purely price action only it's

238
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,090
all that's necessary but when we're

239
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,890
bullish on price action we think the

240
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,020
higher prices are in order let's to say

241
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,880
we come to that conclusion right away if

242
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,460
we're bullish an institutional mindset

243
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,960
is running liquidity on the previous day

244
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,930
or previous days prior to yesterday's

245
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,890
high okay and the reason why is there's

246
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,890
a lot of speculations about capturing

247
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,110
catching highs in the marketplace okay

248
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,620
and especially if we have a day that saw

249
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,550
a retracement the day before or two days

250
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,280
ago lower that means there's going to be

251
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,010
built in positions that are short okay

252
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,910
folks that

253
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,820
I tried to sell short on the marketplace

254
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,810
they're gonna want to try to capitalize

255
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,750
on movement lower where's their buy stop

256
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,820
going to be above the most recent high

257
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,160
what's the most recent high yesterday or

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,290
today before now why am I having you

259
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,420
look back two days ago and include

260
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,720
today's range because every swing high

261
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,520
on a daily chart and every swing low is

262
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,280
comprised and created by three

263
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,650
individual bars you have to be

264
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,150
monitoring these daily highs and lows

265
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,010
because you want to be able to forecast

266
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,660
eventually as I teach you in volume

267
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,700
three swing highs and swing lows before

268
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,010
they actually materialize and start

269
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,570
breaking down because sometimes the

270
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,340
markets will turn on a dime and they

271
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,990
don't give you the setup down with an

272
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,820
outline in this volume one but this is

273
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,440
the bread and butter easy way approach

274
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
it's not going to give you a set up

275
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,770
every single trading day and that's

276
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,530
exactly what I want you to avoid trying

277
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,540
to trade every single day now there's a

278
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,700
reason to trade a demo account every day

279
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,070
to practice the setups but do not try to

280
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,320
force your live account into a condition

281
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,450
where it must trade every single day day

282
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,270
trading is not every day trading so I

283
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,620
want you to take a look at when price

284
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,860
has moved higher every previous day it's

285
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,900
high has been violated okay

286
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,840
generally folks won't pay attention that

287
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,540
simple

288
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,340
phenomenon it's a very simple approach

289
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,010
but it eluded me the first six years of

290
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,130
my trading I didn't see this element to

291
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,290
trading until about six years into my

292
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,990
bond trading now I started as a Treasury

293
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,790
bond trader and SP futures trader those

294
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,070
were my two markets of choice either I

295
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,080
was in spoo's which is SP or I was

296
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,420
trading the Treasury market or bonds I

297
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,880
was rarely ever in both because they are

298
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,210
basically diametrically opposed think of

299
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,620
it like the dollar index and a foreign

300
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,770
currency okay I didn't do anything else

301
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,840
I didn't trade agricultural anymore I

302
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,300
just focus on those two pairs or not two

303
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,760
not pairs but I focused on those two

304
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,670
markets why because I didn't need

305
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,150
anything else if you are watching

306
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,730
multiple pairs right now stop just do it

307
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,070
for one month humor me for one month I

308
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,530
promise you if you give me one month of

309
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,360
your time and focusing on one currency

310
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,430
pair it doesn't have to be one that I

311
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,530
suggest pick one any one of the majors

312
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,570
that's crossed with a dollar I promise

313
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,120
you you will learn you'll learn more by

314
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,920
doing that than trying to do all these

315
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,450
other things with other different pairs

316
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,670
if you're trading multiple assets and

317
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,800
you're now starting to learn forex stop

318
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,570
trading the other asset classes and just

319
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,550
focus one month with me use the

320
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,840
information I give you and again I

321
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,970
guarantee you you will understand price

322
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,710
far better than you ever have before

323
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,800
and it can be very simple approaches so

324
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,860
you got me and want to guarantee there

325
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,200
so now if we're bullish what we want to

326
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,580
be thinking about is where price is

327
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,800
going to be drawn to okay that's called

328
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,950
the drawl now when we look for where the

329
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,770
markets going to reach for in terms of

330
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,180
bullishness it's the previous day's high

331
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,450
or an old high that's gonna be in the

332
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,850
form of buy-side liquidity or buy stops

333
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,820
so the market will draw up to that level

334
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,280
okay and dip into that liquidity pool

335
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,470
where there's existing buy stops for

336
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,510
instance if you were selling short your

337
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,430
buy stop would be above the current

338
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,280
market price at what level whatever the

339
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,350
previous high was that's what the books

340
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,830
tell you right so if your stop

341
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,900
hit what that becomes as a market order

342
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,190
to send a buy order right away in as a

343
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,130
market order so your buy stop transforms

344
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,350
into a market order to buy at the market

345
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,830
and the market is going to be driven up

346
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,950
there from an algorithmic standpoint I'm

347
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,750
not going to get into that here and I'm

348
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,970
not trying to convince you of it just

349
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,100
just suspend your disbelief if you don't

350
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,810
believe it's algorithmic and in terms of

351
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,660
how the markets move think of it as just

352
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,000
you know supply and demand if it helps

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,410
you right now okay

354
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,390
but when price goes above an old high

355
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,530
it's going there to force buyers to come

356
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,760
in at a higher price

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,860
instead of buying low okay they're

358
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,480
forcing buyers to buy at a higher price

359
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,370
so smart money has at some point

360
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,560
accumulated a position at a lower price

361
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,750
and they're driving price up to

362
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,030
formulate an opportunity or condition

363
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,540
for participants to have existing orders

364
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,280
or real interest at buying at a higher

365
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,190
level to be forced into or out of

366
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,410
positions okay and that's all it's it's

367
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,900
all basically framed on now I'm framing

368
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,810
this whole discussion tonight on the

369
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,390
basis of looking for by side liquidity

370
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,930
or by stops or running out by side

371
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,310
liquidity pools okay so when we're

372
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,930
bullish from an institutional standpoint

373
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,210
what we're looking for is the draw the

374
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,220
draw is above where market pricing is

375
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,980
now in the form of cold highs now we're

376
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,620
using for scalping we're using previous

377
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,020
day's high for a very simple little day

378
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,180
trading approach to capture 10 to 30

379
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,840
pips inside of one trading day now every

380
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,980
pair out there does this several times a

381
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,490
week not every day does one singular

382
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,260
pair create this condition so it's

383
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,940
important you have that in your notes do

384
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,310
not anticipate this forming every single

385
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,140
trading day in say for instance the euro

386
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,110
dollar okay if you don't see a setup in

387
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,390
the euro dollar then once you understand

388
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,160
the setup okay then you can go into

389
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,120
other pairs like pick for majors okay

390
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,830
maybe a cross and that's like your

391
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,900
little basket of currencies and you go

392
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,700
through that I'm not inviting you to go

393
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,720
through 28 pairs

394
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,270
okay don't do that but

395
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,950
you can find a setup that I'm going to

396
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,230
teach you tonight every single trading

397
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,630
day to practice on if you have learned

398
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,640
what's going to be presented to you in

399
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,980
the first well you know the first second

400
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,260
and third volume completed once you

401
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,430
understand that and you've practiced for

402
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,130
at least a month then you have my

403
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,400
permission to go into including for

404
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
majors in a cross and then start looking

405
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,150
like that and you'll see that there is a

406
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,490
set up every single trading day but it's

407
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,310
not my invitation or my goal to inspire

408
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,510
you to try to trade every single day

409
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,630
don't do that my hope is that you learn

410
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,550
to find one or two trades like this per

411
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,380
week and then force yourself to be

412
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,030
disciplined did not trade any more

413
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,860
because every time you trade you're

414
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,540
opening the invitation to lose money and

415
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,100
the closer you get to Friday's close

416
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,140
with a losing position it's just gonna

417
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,490
make your mister make you miserable over

418
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,350
the weekend and it's nothing worse than

419
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,520
having made money in the beginning a

420
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
week or sometimes during the week and

421
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,820
then go in one more time and lose it

422
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,350
going in the weekend it's frustrating

423
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,060
I've done it many many times over the

424
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,130
last two decades you don't want to do

425
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,170
that it's avoidable once you make money

426
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,800
in your demo account okay I'm not

427
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,840
promising you make them live funds that

428
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,950
could because I'm not licensed to do

429
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,910
that but I'm teaching you how to

430
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,620
practice in a demo account that's all

431
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,630
I'm doing here if you use this

432
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,069
information and a live account it's on

433
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,440
you win or lose 100% of the

434
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,020
responsibility is on you okay so in this

435
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,750
hourly chart we are looking at two

436
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,180
timeframes the daily which gives us our

437
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,359
bias as I'll indicate and the hourly

438
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,670
what sets up where the markets going to

439
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,010
most likely reach for for the draw okay

440
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,750
that's what it look what it pull is so

441
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,280
if we're bullish again we're looking for

442
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,560
an old high to run to that's it very

443
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,750
simple strategy nothing more than that

444
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,280
okay so now we're looking at a daily

445
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,130
chart and I want you to look at the

446
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,230
patterns I have here because it's gonna

447
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,820
be very important to understand what

448
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,160
these are because it's gonna give us the

449
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,530
context to define when the market should

450
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,980
be bullish and when it should be bearish

451
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,590
over here in the left-hand corner this

452
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,870
is a swing low and this is a crude

453
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,580
depiction I didn't add any color because

454
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,690
I just want you to think about the

455
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,880
overall pattern itself now either any

456
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,190
one of these three candles can be up or

457
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,440
down close in nature in other words it

458
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,970
can be a bullish candle or a bearish

459
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,130
candle all three of these it does not

460
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,830
matter okay all we're looking for is the

461
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,040
generic formation of these three candles

462
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,750
okay one having the lowest low and a

463
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,460
higher load to the left and higher low

464
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,410
to the right it's only three candles or

465
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,750
three bars needed to find this pattern

466
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,030
okay if you look at Mt 4 there's a

467
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,500
little indicator you can click on it's

468
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,810
called a fractal and I really wish they

469
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,400
would have never named that and it's a

470
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
Bill Williams thing I'm not a fan of

471
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,640
Bill Williams material I'm not trying to

472
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,850
be disrespectful but what I'm teaching

473
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,110
you is what I learned from my mentor

474
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,010
Larry Williams

475
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,020
I think he's proven himself he's made

476
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,940
millions of dollars and it's documented

477
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,060
you know he's took 10,000 to over 1

478
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,980
million dollars in 12 months and you can

479
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,500
see that on the rapid trading contest

480
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,390
website you can see he's no one's even

481
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,170
come close to his his record but his

482
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,990
approach to teaching market structure

483
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,030
starts with this simple concept of a

484
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,040
swing high and swing low so when we see

485
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,380
a swing low it's three bars or three

486
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,700
candles okay once that forms what we in

487
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
the old days will call that would be a

488
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,080
ring low okay because we didn't have

489
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,790
charge we had to really just write that

490
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,770
down on a notebook and the lowest of the

491
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,650
three candles or the lowest in recent

492
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,050
week or the month we would we would put

493
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,210
a circle around that that number okay on

494
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,720
our little binder and that's the way it

495
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,580
was it was it was like that in old days

496
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,320
so we would know that that wasn't

497
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
important well why because it had a

498
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,710
higher load to the right of it and the

499
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,930
higher load to the left of it okay so

500
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,880
when we see this formation on a daily

501
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,340
chart okay what we're looking for is

502
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,550
this to occur after this is important

503
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,400
you need to anticipate this forming

504
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,999
after a swing high has been broken

505
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,320
now probably just took a huge leap

506
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,330
forward and probably lost a few of you

507
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,609
so let me say it again we are only

508
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,440
really interested in looking for daily

509
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,999
swing lows after a swing high which is a

510
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,220
high that has two lower highs on either

511
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,769
side of it okay in other words we've got

512
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:16,950
one daily candle or bar with yesterday

513
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,440
or the previous day's high being lower

514
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,809
than today's and then tomorrow's day

515
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,869
should have a lower high okay so notes

516
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:25,859
this is what we're seeing a three bar

517
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,769
pattern you wait for this to occur in

518
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,809
the price action and if price trades

519
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,909
through the swing high you are now on

520
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:37,200
bullish alert you wait for the swing low

521
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
the form what you have done is you've

522
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,789
waited for institutions to get back in

523
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,309
line with the momentum on a short-term

524
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,499
basis and the algorithm once it creates

525
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,659
that swing low again after the swing

526
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,700
high has been broken momentum is now

527
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,859
bullish and you're waiting for this

528
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,720
short-term pattern here when that

529
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,940
happens your focus is going to go

530
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,899
immediately to the high of this number

531
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,929
three candle and I mean I mean I mean

532
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,249
number of these candles so that way we

533
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:08,009
can track it and know what we're looking

534
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:12,059
at so this is for directional bias these

535
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,619
candles now have numbers on them and

536
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,269
it's always moving left to right

537
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,460
number one candle number two cannon

538
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,499
number three candle what we're doing is

539
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,749
we're watching once the daily swing low

540
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:25,769
forms we want to see the high be traded

541
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:29,700
through one day number four okay once

542
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,159
day number four does that we know that

543
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,190
day number five we can be looking for a

544
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,019
run on previous day's high liquidity you

545
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,039
can be aggressive

546
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,149
once this formation occurs if we open

547
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,690
below number three's high you say Noren

548
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,879
Doren London or New York if we're below

549
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,379
that low if we have a condition that

550
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,419
presents an optimal trade entry you can

551
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,460
go along and look for a run on number 3s

552
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,889
high for run on liquidity above number

553
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,279
threes by stops that's a little

554
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,599
aggressive and I'll give you rules to do

555
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,389
that in volume number three but tonight

556
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,220
I want to keep it very simple and very

557
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,480
very Elementary

558
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,190
so as a recap what we want to do is we

559
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,440
want to see a swing high this formation

560
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,580
form and we see that here okay we see a

561
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,400
swing high it has a lower high to the

562
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
left of it a lower high to the right of

563
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,150
it and we want to see it trade through

564
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,540
that high it does it here right here on

565
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,900
this large wick candle when that happens

566
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,360
we start looking for this formation on

567
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,490
the daily chart

568
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,500
it happens right here okay we have a

569
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,450
long whipped candle it has a higher load

570
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,010
to the left of it a higher load to the

571
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,840
right of it and the very next day we

572
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,210
want to be looking for runs on previous

573
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,440
day's highs for a resistance of previous

574
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,900
day's high it's going to give them in

575
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,720
the retail world the false sense of

576
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,850
security that the previous day's high is

577
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,510
gonna stop price and it's not going to

578
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,710
so we can see how markets that have this

579
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,880
condition have a tendency to

580
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,540
continuously move higher each day look

581
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,040
at how the previous day's high is

582
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,710
violated to some degree okay and then

583
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,000
when we get these inside days and I'll

584
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,280
talk about that and volume to inside

585
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,250
days are going to be important but not

586
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,840
so important for the first of all you

587
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,130
might just want to understand the basic

588
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,050
premise on how we get the directional

589
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,420
bias and why the swing highs and swing

590
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,750
lows are important so each previous

591
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,690
day's high is taken to some degree every

592
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,240
day has a varying amount of pips and

593
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,309
again I'm not trying to promote the idea

594
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,320
of knowing exactly how many pips you

595
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,630
next week's gonna have or three days

596
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,550
from now it's not important there

597
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,290
there'll be tools and things that you

598
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,760
learn in volume 3 to help you get to

599
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,700
that but for now just be content with

600
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,590
learning the general rules of how to

601
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,630
determine whether the market is bullish

602
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,780
or bearish if you do this okay this is

603
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,309
not mentorship level bias but it is a

604
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,740
real quick down and dirty approach and

605
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,720
this is actually how I learned it the

606
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,320
first time in terms of finding basically

607
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,850
daily momentum it's all of this and it

608
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,200
doesn't require you to have any kind of

609
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,330
momentum indicator to do it no moving

610
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,800
average and none of that stuff okay you

611
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,870
can read it just from price so again

612
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,520
simple rules are we want to see a swing

613
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,670
high broken to the upside okay we see it

614
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,520
here with this swing high so now we have

615
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,850
momentum on the bullishness pulls back

616
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,429
wait for a swing low deform that's this

617
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:35,559
pattern here and then we start watching

618
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,890
number 3s high okay we want to see

619
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,500
number 3s high be violated in this case

620
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,650
here we see it violate right there with

621
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,070
this kind of like of a indecisive candle

622
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,530
and in the very night

623
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,900
today we see what it opens it trades

624
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,300
down and then blasts off through the

625
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,910
previous day's high now when you have

626
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,130
that type of move it can happen the

627
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,040
following day and it does it opens okay

628
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,510
and trades above the high a little bit

629
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,950
that in itself as a scalp there's

630
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,000
nothing wrong with that little bit of a

631
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,240
move but I want you to focus on finding

632
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,980
one good set up so if we have a move

633
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,640
like this chances are I would probably

634
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,470
look at another pair only because I

635
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,450
understand the conditions and I know the

636
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,210
set up so it may have burnt itself out

637
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,010
on one pair which I see if it's a big

638
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,740
move if it's just a marginal move then

639
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,000
they'll probably seek follow-through on

640
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,260
the next day and maybe the next day

641
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,230
after that so we have it again here it

642
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,900
opens okay trades down a little bit and

643
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,030
goes higher running out the previous

644
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,250
day's high again and again that's the

645
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,500
trade that's all is it's a scalp we are

646
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,720
not trying to get the weekly low at this

647
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,010
we're not trying to get the daily low

648
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,020
and holding to the close all we're doing

649
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,850
is looking for an opportunity to run a

650
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,550
previous day's high or a high from two

651
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,160
days ago that's the context that's the

652
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,900
premise behind the system that's the

653
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,740
method okay why does this work I'm sure

654
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,730
you probably asking yourself when you

655
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,650
know why is this why this does have any

656
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,700
validity to it when bank level traders

657
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,930
are working they are trying to turn over

658
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,900
liquidity okay and what I just taught

659
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,370
you is the draw

660
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,080
okay the draw is previous highs and

661
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,290
previous lows referencing daily highs

662
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,290
and lows banks target those liquidity

663
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,460
pools more than anything else in forex

664
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,020
don't take my word for it go through

665
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,100
your charts and you'll see that's

666
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,000
exactly what goes on when you have

667
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,670
things that are bearish okay we're just

668
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,980
you know flip the script for a minute we

669
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,010
want to see price trade below a swing

670
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,860
low once that occurs then we start

671
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,900
waiting for a swing high to form why are

672
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,000
we doing that because we're waiting for

673
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,820
a retracement it's gonna go to an

674
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,580
overbought condition we don't need any

675
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,440
critters to do that or derive that

676
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,850
information when we have this short term

677
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,820
high here or swing high form we start

678
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,760
watching the daily candle number three

679
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,500
and we want to see it trade through that

680
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,900
low if it does we know that we are in

681
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,760
bear territory and we're probably going

682
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,950
to see each previous day's low be

683
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,420
violated and that's the setup

684
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,270
that's condition and that's an it's seen

685
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:20,370
here okay we see a swing low broken here

686
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,260
and then we wait for a swing high to

687
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,440
form that's here we have a high with a

688
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,060
lower high to the left of it a lower

689
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,890
high to the right of it we wait for this

690
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,990
number three candles low to be taken out

691
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,790
it does it here so now what we do is we

692
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,860
target a run on this candles low

693
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,050
it opens trades up creates the high

694
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,990
today and slams them okay that's it

695
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,780
that's the setup it doesn't doesn't have

696
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,120
a whole lot of sexiness to it but I'm

697
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,380
telling you right now it's got a whole

698
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,420
lot of consistency to it and a lot of

699
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,040
you probably don't have any consistency

700
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,600
whatsoever or what you're looking for

701
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,850
and this is a very easy bread-and-butter

702
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,430
approach now again I am NOT trying to

703
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,130
package this in a every day approach for

704
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,220
one individual pair this works in stocks

705
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,080
it works in futures it works in bonds it

706
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
works in just about anything they can

707
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,560
trade so when we have this momentum on a

708
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,300
daily chart and we know we're either

709
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,030
bullish or bearish it stays that way

710
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,710
until we get a break in opposing market

711
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,780
momentum I'll give you an example what

712
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,240
that would look like here we have a

713
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,850
swing low form and then price comes down

714
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,100
and breaks that swing low that upsets

715
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,160
the momentum at this point we have to

716
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,060
see a short-term high be broken okay a

717
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,630
short

718
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,240
hi has to be broken and then we have it

719
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,580
here we have a high with a lower high

720
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,710
and a lower high to the right of it it's

721
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,020
broken to the upside here so when we

722
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,060
have that now we go back into cycle of

723
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,150
looking for a swing low swing low forms

724
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,750
here we have a candle to the left of it

725
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,600
that's high or low below in the middle

726
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,190
and the next candle is up so we want to

727
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,960
see price trade through number three

728
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,200
candles hi it does in fact do it here

729
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,490
and we trade through the next day

730
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,050
running the previous day's high and it

731
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,080
continues that cycle again okay so all

732
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,100
we're doing is monitoring a break in the

733
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,250
swing highs and swing lows giving us a

734
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,110
bias on the daily chart why am I looking

735
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,900
forward on a daily chart because

736
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,030
momentum that begins when the daily

737
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,960
chart tends to occur and be lasting for

738
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,420
at least a few days it could be two to

739
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,360
five days in duration so if we have a

740
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,520
mentum working one side higher or lower

741
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,040
it tends to stay in that direction for a

742
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,320
period of a few days and that's all you

743
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,720
need to have a really good scenario for

744
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,610
short term trading intraday scalps

745
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,130
so again in summary when we're looking

746
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,429
for the swing low this is only being

747
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,590
stalked or looked for in price action

748
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,529
until we see a short term swing high

749
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,870
being broken when that happens then we

750
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,480
start looking for this pattern okay for

751
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,700
daily swing highs this only is being

752
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,769
hunted or stalked in price action after

753
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,690
a swing low has been broken

754
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,429
that gives us a break in market

755
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,769
structures but it's basically giving us

756
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,320
a definition of and then afterwards it's

757
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,850
going to be a retracement and when we

758
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,679
see that retracement occur with a swing

759
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,240
high we know that we can start looking

760
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,039
for sells running out previous day's

761
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,379
lows when we see the swing high broken

762
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:32,860
and we find a swing low form later on we

763
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,169
know we can look for kendall number 3s

764
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,509
highs to be rated and look for the buy

765
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,580
stops to be ran out or intraday scalp

766
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,710
that's a very very simple approach is

767
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,779
very easy and if you're not

768
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,159
understanding it just watch this video

769
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,899
again I promise you you're probably over

770
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:50,850
complicating it and it's not necessary

771
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,169
so I'm going to focus our attention on

772
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,730
this little segment of price action here

773
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,289
in the shaded area and we're actually

774
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,179
gonna walk through on a narrow a chart

775
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,879
and look at the framework of each one of

776
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,980
these respective days and how it targets

777
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,580
liquidity runs on previous day's highs

778
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,629
okay folks we're looking at the a lay

779
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:09,820
chart at the beginning of that shaded

780
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,009
area to show it on a daily chart for us

781
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:16,870
CAD and I want you to just see these

782
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,330
lines down here okay these are just

783
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,200
delineating the ICT kills them and the

784
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,169
red area is delineating specifically

785
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:28,330
aiming at around two o'clock in the

786
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,139
morning to four o'clock in the morning

787
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,399
New York time everything I say in terms

788
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,769
of time you're gonna have to translate

789
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,129
that into your local time relative to

790
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:42,129
New York time okay so if I say two

791
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,240
o'clock in the morning New York time

792
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,669
wherever you're at globally just get

793
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,250
yourself a clock set to New York time

794
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,529
and then look at that time in reference

795
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:51,730
to your local time and you'll be able to

796
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,710
decipher what it is you have to do and

797
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,990
make the adjustments I do not want to

798
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,970
get into conversation about time because

799
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,080
it's very confusing for me admittedly

800
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,730
I've done this many times in the past

801
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,700
and

802
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,760
erroneously said something and confused

803
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,400
a reader or viewer so it's better for

804
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,920
you to just do the work in transferring

805
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,200
and converting your local time into New

806
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,510
York time okay so London is basically

807
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,860
two o'clock to four o'clock in the

808
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,110
morning that's the sweet spot or the

809
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,360
best time to anticipate a higher load of

810
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,930
form and the New York is going to be

811
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,270
seven o'clock in the morning to ten

812
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,170
o'clock in the morning we'll just give

813
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,810
you a nice little one day like that it

814
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,550
can be refined and defined in my

815
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,050
tutorials but for now just for the sake

816
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,160
of this method just use those times all

817
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,100
right so we have our beginning of our

818
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,750
shaded area when we're looking for

819
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,600
bullishness as defined in the first part

820
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,300
of this presentation and I want you to

821
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,410
look at how price moves running out

822
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,220
previous day's highs okay and here's a

823
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,680
previous day's high right here and I'm

824
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,650
going to try to do this as as quick as I

825
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,610
possibly can

826
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,850
and keep things moving along but the

827
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,350
a high on this particular day here you

828
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,080
can see one to start of this candle here

829
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,700
it starts and immediately runs through a

830
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,070
little bit doesn't go by much but then

831
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,690
it eventually trades through it here

832
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,720
that in itself this little move here

833
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,390
that's actually a trade it doesn't seem

834
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,860
like much it doesn't feel like much but

835
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,330
that's a trade now you're probably

836
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,440
because your eyes looking at in the

837
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,030
benefit of hindsight you're gonna look

838
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,190
at this high and this move down and say

839
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,390
well that's what I really want to

840
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,430
capture if you're going to think like

841
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,900
that about everything I'm going to show

842
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,030
you in these tutorials I'm not gonna be

843
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,920
any help to you okay because what you're

844
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,150
gonna be doing is trying to have

845
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,310
perfection and I can't promise and I

846
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,620
don't promise perfection at all I do

847
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,470
provide you resources that's going to

848
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,820
help you get better at your price action

849
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,590
analysis and that's the only thing I

850
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,670
promise okay

851
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,420
so we have a low here and a daily high

852
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,340
and the expectation is we want to see

853
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,950
the high be ran out we want to see the

854
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,410
the expectation of moving through this

855
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,360
high why because there's going to be

856
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,270
liquidity a bit above that high why I'm

857
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,489
not going into it here just trust me

858
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,650
the banks make runs on previous day's

859
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,820
highs and lows and if it's bullish

860
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,989
they're gonna be targeting previous

861
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:21,090
day's high okay so the way we frame our

862
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,360
setups is we use our FID and we find the

863
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,850
lowest bodied fortunately the candle

864
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,580
that's going to be this open here and we

865
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,310
drag that up to here okay why he just

866
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,350
jumped off the level I wanted to have it

867
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,860
on sorry

868
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,660
you

869
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,739
I want on this candle right here because

870
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,120
it's gonna be the highest body before

871
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,389
this little retracement okay and at this

872
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,889
point we're gonna be anticipating

873
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,780
because it only this briefly violated

874
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,639
the previous day's high we want to see a

875
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,560
retracement our mind is waiting for it

876
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,470
to trade lower okay once it trades lower

877
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,610
we're going to looking forward to go

878
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,320
down into the optimal trade entry okay

879
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,060
that's our price pattern it doesn't do

880
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,530
it until after this little movement up

881
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,540
now on a smaller time frame we could

882
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,800
probably see something in here that's an

883
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,790
optimal trade entry but I'm going to

884
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,220
save that for volume too but in here I'm

885
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,100
giving you the big setups for your scalp

886
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,310
setup okay so using the our chart we're

887
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,750
gonna see it here and we're gonna be

888
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,300
targeting previous day's high now even

889
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,340
this day when it trades down to here we

890
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,320
could be targeting a run back to

891
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,660
previous day's high and now what have we

892
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,490
included

893
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,589
we have a higher high here in the same

894
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,240
day so intraday we have a higher high

895
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,000
and we have previous day's high both of

896
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,780
these conditions are candidates for run

897
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,640
on liquidity

898
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,130
okay so we have this one and we have

899
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,099
this one so as price trades down here we

900
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,680
want to anticipate a movement higher to

901
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,739
run to this level which it does here and

902
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,569
eventually back to this high here which

903
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,960
it doesn't do until this candle here

904
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,180
notice that price trades down in the

905
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,239
bodies of the candles respect the 79%

906
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,780
race own level okay

907
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,730
back up to this high this is why I say

908
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,090
you want to take profit okay at old

909
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,930
highs and at your first scaling here

910
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,430
this is target one you can take profit

911
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,530
there notice it never takes the high out

912
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,720
yet has to retrace all the way back down

913
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,840
to precisely the seven times it hurts me

914
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,940
again then rallies through taking out

915
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,890
intraday high previous day's high and

916
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,340
again two days ago okay

917
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,850
this is your run on previous day's high

918
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:42,380
liquidity now this candle on a daily

919
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,640
basis its high is here

920
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,270
same scenario in here it rallies up

921
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,600
takes out that high which again we're

922
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,740
gonna have to see that on a lower

923
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,970
timeframe we're not going to do it in

924
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,430
this volume but as it runs through we

925
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,440
want to see a retracement okay we have

926
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,740
the bodies of this run here why am i

927
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,510
using this one because it's the most

928
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,170
dynamic recent rally and we want to use

929
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,620
it on the highest body open or close

930
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,790
which is here price trades down into the

931
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,070
sixty two percent recent level right in

932
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,390
here we're do be targeting previous

933
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,990
day's high which is here and we also now

934
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,300
we have an intraday high here so we have

935
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,790
two reference points to look for so

936
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,500
we're anticipate the banks making a run

937
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,260
on both of those levels they initially

938
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,380
it's this one okay so on the next day it

939
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,350
trades back down again giving you

940
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,810
another opportunity to go long if you

941
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,910
were trading here you're outside of the

942
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,080
kill zone okay I want you to notice that

943
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,970
every time that we create signal and

944
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,890
setup if it overlaps with one of these

945
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,920
colored levels okay or lines that makes

946
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,410
it high probability if it's outside of

947
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,080
one of those shaded time windows it's

948
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,270
less favorable it doesn't mean it can't

949
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,600
eventually move to profitability and

950
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,450
your demo it just means that it's far

951
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,600
more likely to occur if it's occurring

952
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,430
during one of these shaded time windows

953
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,870
okay so

954
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,540
and again the blue one here is the New

955
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,530
York kill zone and the red one is London

956
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,120
so we have a setup here it trades back

957
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,800
down into optimal trade entry here and

958
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,950
it does so at the time of New York

959
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,070
okay so New York and London both have an

960
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,080
opportunity to create a buying

961
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,790
opportunity London will give it to you

962
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,590
that you probably got stopped out same

963
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,690
scenario unfolds for New York New York

964
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,560
explodes runs through previous type days

965
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,470
high of two days before and previous

966
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,150
day's high here runs right through it

967
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,090
that's the trade and it's over it's done

968
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,380
there's nothing else to consider there's

969
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,330
nothing else to worry about the trade is

970
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,630
over okay so now in here we've had a

971
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,390
couple examples nice little payouts not

972
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,520
barnburners not Grand Slams

973
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,490
but bread-and-butter setups just using

974
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,500
one pair in the course upside inside of

975
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,810
a week we have nice little setups and

976
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,970
it's given us a really good opportunity

977
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,250
to target a logical level which is the

978
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,710
previous day's high and under the

979
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,630
context of a retracement to a logical

980
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,270
level which is the FIB using a framework

981
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,160
of

982
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,190
bodies

983
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,050
two bodies in terms of the swing highs

984
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,660
and swing lows and also as a quick note

985
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,359
habits in your notepad easy way to go

986
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,490
for what swing high and what swing low I

987
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,619
draw my fit from I use session highs and

988
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,240
session lows so whatever the highest

989
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,670
high and low was during London and or

990
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,589
New York I used those reference points

991
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,260
and then I just used a body's either the

992
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,869
open or closed whichever is the lowest

993
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:52,849
for the low point of the fifth and the

994
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,430
high point is whatever the highest is

995
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,750
open or the close inside of the high

996
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,780
okay and that's all there is to it each

997
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,579
each new day you're waiting for an

998
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:03,950
opportunity for it to retrace back down

999
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,349
into what would be otherwise standard

1000
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:07,760
optimal trade entry which is a 62

1001
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,250
percent 70 percent trade level but

1002
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,859
targeting previous day's highs now

1003
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:14,750
notice once we hit this previous day's

1004
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,720
high here the mark goes into some of a

1005
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,210
of a consolidation now we do get a

1006
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,869
little bit of a run here but not to the

1007
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,400
degree where we can really brag about or

1008
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,390
go to great lengths to justify it we do

1009
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,150
have a nice retracement here okay and I

1010
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,040
want you to take a look at that because

1011
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,190
when we have a retracement of a day or

1012
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,819
so that usually puts the cycle back in

1013
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,970
rotation so we have a retracement here

1014
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,040
price comes back down to the 70.5 level

1015
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,470
which is a sweet spot o te okay and it's

1016
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,630
happening at the time of New York so

1017
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,400
that's a good scenario we could see a

1018
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,010
buy there but look it rolls over into

1019
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,290
the next day in London it hits it again

1020
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,020
so your stop would never been hit but

1021
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,339
you're holding on for a long period of

1022
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,690
time so this is where it's gonna stretch

1023
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,089
your patience as a scalper which is the

1024
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,470
reason why I like being short trying

1025
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,880
because I know these are the conditions

1026
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,339
it's most likely gonna happen hits the

1027
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:13,190
62% shape 62 percent retracement level

1028
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,579
rather and once it hits that in London

1029
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,640
then it explodes what's it reaching for

1030
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,960
previous day's high it runs through that

1031
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,780
with no resistance whatsoever and blows

1032
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,210
through previous day's high back here

1033
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,690
okay so really nice little opportunity

1034
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,910
there and whenever you see a full day's

1035
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,060
down close that's like a big red neon

1036
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,190
sign say start following me especially

1037
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,390
if you're in a bullish scenario

1038
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,099
that markets primed to have an optimal

1039
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,599
trade entry long and start running out

1040
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,589
previous day's highs

1041
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:45,720
okay on this one particular day here

1042
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,869
price moves 3050 almost 70 pips or so

1043
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,289
okay really really quickly and this is

1044
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:57,809
all mostly inside of one hour big

1045
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,549
explosive price move here and that was

1046
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:03,089
seen on October 5th and this continues

1047
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,670
on going through price action and when

1048
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,700
we have scenarios that present

1049
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,960
themselves with the highest form of

1050
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,049
probability and not seeing any breakdown

1051
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,089
on a daily chart it gives us framework

1052
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:17,730
context and specifics about what we're

1053
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,380
looking for when we're looking for it

1054
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,519
kill zone

1055
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,650
what price level Osmel trade entry what

1056
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,180
are we targeting previous day's highs or

1057
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,299
the day before it so yesterday's high or

1058
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,450
the day before yesterday's high that's

1059
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,069
what we're targeting more bullish very

1060
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:33,960
very simple approach nothing more to it

1061
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,680
than that

1062
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,930
I'll amplify it in volume 2 and I'll

1063
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,019
wrap it up with concise more or less a

1064
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:42,269
trading plan in volume 30 hopefully you

1065
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,829
found this insightful until next time we

1066
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:47,150
should good luck and good trading
