1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,540
okay folks welcome back this is volume

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,109
two of three for mastering high

3
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,140
probability scalping we're focusing on

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,689
previous day bank liquidity runs alright

5
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,590
so we'll be reviewing the daily bias so

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,440
we everyone knows exactly what should be

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,230
done and I'm referring to a daily chart

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,620
here so when we're implementing the

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,120
daily bias what we're gonna be doing is

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,320
on a daily chart we're gonna be waiting

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,399
for a swing high to form and to be

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,370
broken this will be bullish okay when we

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,690
see a swing high broken in other words a

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,160
candle that has a lower high to the left

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,989
of it and then lower high to the right

16
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,780
of it as seen here okay if at any time

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,409
in the future its traded through when we

18
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,770
have that we have a bullish stage in

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,890
other words we anticipate a future

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,960
buying opportunity doesn't mean to buy

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,689
it right there just means we are now on

22
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,350
an alert to wait for a specific criteria

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,729
criteria is going to be looking for a

24
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,079
swing low to form down here okay a swing

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,450
low again is a candle that has a higher

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,979
load to the left of it and a higher load

27
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,840
to the right of it again on the daily

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,270
chart key point here is this swing low

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,750
should not take out a previous recent

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,860
swing low okay so if we have this

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,860
criteria immediately after a heist

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,530
broken we have the probable optimal

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,409
trade entry scenario by itself on a

34
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,619
daily chart okay doesn't mean it has to

35
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,630
line up with a 62 - sometimes at Racing

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,610
level it just means that we are in

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,260
effect trading with a higher

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,170
after breaking a short-term high so we

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,519
have a break-in market structure a

40
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,739
retracement so therefore the market

41
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,430
should have an ability to find momentum

42
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,560
on the upside okay when the swing low

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,239
forms we're going to be anticipating the

44
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,629
third candle that is this one here it's

45
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,970
high to be rated or traded through the

46
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,879
very next day so in other words the next

47
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,010
trading day where it opens preferably

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,730
you want to see it open below the third

49
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,859
candle the swing lows high

50
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:51,370
okay so here's your criterion you want

51
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,239
to see the swing low form without

52
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,879
breaking a previous swing low

53
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,290
immediately after a swing high is formed

54
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,260
but breaking a previous swing high ok so

55
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,629
again the stage for a bullish scenario

56
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,950
is anytime I swing high is broken and

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,859
traded to a new high expect a

58
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,769
retracement wait for a daily swing low

59
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,199
to form swing low should be a higher

60
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,930
swing load in any recent previous

61
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,239
short-term swing low the third candle

62
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,760
that makes the swing low that high you

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,629
want to see the next candle open below

64
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,720
that candle is high and then anticipate

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,690
the market to run through this candle is

66
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,090
high we're looking for previous day's

67
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,579
highs to be rated each day until a swing

68
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,729
high when a daily forms or price reaches

69
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,129
a key support or resistance level and

70
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,449
I'll give you an example what that would

71
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,569
be well the immediate candle after this

72
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,209
particular day's formation may be

73
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,459
looking for a bullish scenario okay

74
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,229
either in London or the New York

75
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:09,250
scenario to a raid on the previous day's

76
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,519
high the very next trading day we would

77
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,859
look for the same scenario again looking

78
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,269
for reasons to be bullish on a

79
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,358
retracement lower going higher reaching

80
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,930
for ultimately to this old high this

81
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,600
would be an area of resistance okay

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,630
or if it trades to that high and through

83
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,880
it we'd still maintain looking for

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,610
bullish scenarios buying looking for

85
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,430
previous day's highs to be taken out or

86
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,670
if we have price rally up to a degree

87
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,650
either at this level or before it in

88
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,160
creating a swing high once that forms we

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,440
have to wait for that swing high to be

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,050
broke on the upside okay there's going

91
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,550
to be a lot of missed opportunities

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,160
admittedly with this but it gives you a

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,530
specific criteria on the work within ok

94
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,420
employing the daily bias this is when

95
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,590
it's bearish and we waiting again on the

96
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,100
daily chart for a swing low on a daily

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,790
to be broken so we have a swing low here

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,490
again a daily candle that has a higher

99
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,410
low to the left of it and a higher low

100
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,050
to the right of it eventually as price

101
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,370
trades through this this break in market

102
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,470
structure it sets the stage for a

103
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,370
bearish market condition okay so we're

104
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,770
kind of like alerted to waiting for a

105
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,160
sell scenario we wait for a retracement

106
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
when we get the daily swing high formed

107
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,570
the third can look at it makes a swing

108
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,020
high we're going to anticipating that

109
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,720
low to be violated the very next trading

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,000
day key point is we don't want to see

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,890
this swing high break a previous swing

112
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,780
high immediately before the swing low

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,160
that has broken a previous swing low

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,810
okay so what we're doing is we're

115
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,160
looking for a swing low broken here so

116
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,330
now we have the ability to see the

117
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,320
market trade to a new a new low then it

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,450
retraces but will not break a swing high

119
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,990
so now we're getting net three quarter

120
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,810
back retracement okay so by itself it's

121
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,060
like an optimal trade entry doesn't have

122
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,370
to be 260 to 270 I'm searching some

123
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,680
level it's better if it does but it

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,530
doesn't require it you want to see the

125
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,510
market trade up until it creates a daily

126
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,950
swing high when that third candle forms

127
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,170
at its close very next trading day

128
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,290
you'll be watching for price to make an

129
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,420
attempt to trade through this candles

130
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,730
low and that remains the bias each

131
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,460
trading day until I swing low forms or

132
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,820
we trade down to this old low okay or

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,900
another signifigant low so again

134
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,270
summary its we're looking for a swing

135
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,340
low to form on the daily chart and then

136
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,690
it be broken then we're looking for a

137
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,730
swing high to form but does not break a

138
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,310
recent swing high so here's a swing high

139
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,380
that doesn't come back the clear or

140
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,100
break a previous swing high when to

141
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,820
swing high forms we anticipate the third

142
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,560
daily candle in the swing high right

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,500
here we look for its load to be rated or

144
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,520
traded through the following day and we

145
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,930
look for the previous day's low to be

146
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,720
rated each day until a new swing low on

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,690
a daily forms or price reaches a key

148
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,640
support resistance level now you're not

149
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,350
going to have a set up every single

150
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,990
trading day okay I've gotten a lot of

151
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,410
emails so far since I've produced a

152
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,450
first volume of this three-part series

153
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,650
and the common complaint I'm getting is

154
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,110
I'm not getting a setup every day and

155
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,070
it's not been promised okay if you look

156
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,130
at every major that's paired against the

157
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,790
dollar you can get about three to four

158
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,080
solid setups per week now that means

159
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,640
that you're probably not going to get us

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,460
up every single trading day chances are

161
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,400
one pair among all the ones that are

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
available will provide you a set up to

163
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,350
study so you can practice in your demo

164
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,220
account with it the emphasis is for you

165
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,190
to remember that you'd only need about

166
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,010
25 pips or so per week and if you risk

167
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,220
2% of your account and it may be high

168
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,400
admittedly for some of you but if you

169
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,900
have grown in your understanding about

170
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,970
what I'm teaching and you're willing to

171
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,540
risk 2% it takes a little bit less than

172
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,590
25 pips per week to double your

173
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,190
or make 6% compounded monthly and I

174
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,740
think that's the objective that folks

175
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,500
should be looking for when you're new

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,020
because it's realistic it's low but yet

177
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,300
it still doubles the account over the

178
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,610
course of a twelvemonth year so if we're

179
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,160
looking for one good set up that would

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,610
yield that 25 pips or so you only need

181
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,360
one scalp one set up that does that now

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,370
I started the current teaching week on

183
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,700
Twitter kind of building the idea of

184
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,700
making 50 pips per week if you frame

185
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,640
your scalps in such a way that it allows

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,970
you to aim for 25 pips you only really

187
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,210
need to set up for a week don't you now

188
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,970
I like that model personally because

189
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,180
it's very close to what I do as a

190
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,060
short-term or intraday trader I know the

191
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,040
likelihood is I want to be trading on

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,589
Tuesdays and Wednesdays if I can get my

193
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,570
entire weekly objective which is 50 to

194
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,720
75 pips per week if I can get that done

195
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,280
in one day then I won't do any more

196
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,870
trading after that regardless of what

197
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,450
day of the week it is but usually I hone

198
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,830
in on Tuesday and Wednesday because

199
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,810
they're primarily the best days whether

200
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,540
bullish or bearish if it's bullish for

201
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,210
the week then I'm looking for the weekly

202
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,710
low to form around Tuesday or Wednesday

203
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,630
is New York open if I can anticipate a

204
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,400
lower close or weekly bearish candle I'm

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,960
shooting with an expectation that we're

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,400
gonna be seeing lower prices by Friday's

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,339
close relative to Sunday's opening then

208
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,510
I'll be looking for Tuesday or Wednesday

209
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,150
--zz price action to create the high of

210
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,820
the week so if I can train and sync with

211
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,400
that idea

212
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,810
it also formulates a lot more conviction

213
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,390
and confidence behind the setups that

214
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,650
I'm looking to trade especially with

215
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,600
what's being described here it's a

216
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,390
rather simplistic approach it may have

217
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,089
been an oversimplification on my part by

218
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,760
way of creating this diagram but from an

219
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,890
internal standpoint how I view the

220
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,630
market place this is what I'm looking

221
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,060
for

222
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,540
so if I see them daily chart chances are

223
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,450
the daily chart will probably sustain

224
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,690
the move for a few days and you'll only

225
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,940
need one trading day okay so if you

226
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,650
having a scenario that's bullish or

227
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,760
bearish relative to what I just

228
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,200
described here so far in this video

229
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,250
chances are you you're probably gonna

230
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,430
have one day's worth of momentum and

231
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,860
that's all you need so every single pair

232
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,500
does not move lockstep to one another

233
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,280
they're not always moving in tandem so

234
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,050
what may be a good parent trade today

235
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,380
may not be a pair that's really good to

236
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,410
trade tomorrow but another pair may move

237
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,590
in equal or better fashion in other

238
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,460
words the setups are plenty but you have

239
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,790
to allow them to be presented in price

240
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,790
action from the daily chart and then not

241
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,700
forcing it let's take a look over at the

242
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,160
charts I'll give you an example of what

243
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
it looks like and we can use the kill

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,930
zones okay we're looking at the table

245
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,260
this is a daily chart this stroll

246
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,140
through just family random place it

247
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,430
doesn't make a difference where we start

248
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,460
out but I want you to take a look at the

249
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,800
price action here and we're going to

250
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,920
look at this swing low right here and

251
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,540
it's on the heels of a previous

252
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,960
short-term high okay so we have a

253
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,780
short-term high here lower high to the

254
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,060
left lower high to the right highest

255
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,240
high in the middle it breaks that okay

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,440
so now we're on a buy watch for scalping

257
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,190
this is a swing high that's broken and

258
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,870
we have to wait for a swing low to form

259
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,900
after this is broken so we're gonna be

260
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,390
anticipating a retracement after this

261
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,860
run-up says price starts to drop down

262
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,830
we have a preliminary swing low here

263
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,170
okay so this candle is the third one we

264
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,510
need to make sure we wait for price to

265
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,340
trade through this candle is high the

266
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,190
very next day it doesn't do that okay

267
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,920
now we have another candle form a

268
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,510
potential swing low here so this candle

269
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,920
here we have to wait for this candle is

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,750
high to be traded through very next

271
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,420
candle it doesn't do it it does it here

272
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,480
so now we can be a buyer here with a

273
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,040
Scout running previous day's high which

274
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,950
is this one okay so one July 24th 2017

275
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,760
that high again coming in at 130 57

276
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,100
that's where the liquidity run is going

277
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,580
to be right there this candle on the

278
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,130
25th of July is where we'll be looking

279
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:15,660
for the set up right there okay and

280
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
we're going to drop down into a smaller

281
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,400
time frame we use a 15-minute time frame

282
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,580
okay and I'll scrunch this up the day

283
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,970
dividers in you guys can see it so

284
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,700
previous day's high is right here so

285
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,340
I'll put a horizontal line on the chart

286
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,270
to facilitate that okay so here's where

287
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:54,110
the liquidity is we're running for 30 57

288
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,190
okay this day here we're looking for a

289
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,120
scenario to get long to run that liquidy

290
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:13,080
pool okay and we have this again it's

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,670
the liquidly poor wrist we're reaching

292
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,460
for previous day's high on this trading

293
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,610
day when I use the market

294
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,700
sessions I'm looking for London setups

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,090
and newer setups primarily this is a

296
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,180
London session low and I'll let you see

297
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,380
that here that's in London and we're

298
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,610
gonna use that as I mentioned in the

299
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,030
volume one I use session highs and lows

300
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:52,140
and this is the highest portion of the

301
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,740
day in terms of a 15 minute candle you

302
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,690
just put it right here you guys can see

303
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,760
it so I'm using this one and this one

304
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,030
framing the entire price moon so as

305
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,250
price starts this day here I'm not

306
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,050
concerned about anything until it gets

307
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,610
down into the optimal trade entry 62%

308
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,080
tracing level respectively 70.5 and 79%

309
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,210
okay you can see it price trades it hits

310
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,180
it here this candle comes in exactly

311
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,280
9:45 that's London and we're going into

312
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,410
a nice run into previous day's high okay

313
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,150
so you can see that was a nice little

314
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,230
scalp it offered as much as 10 20 30 40

315
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,980
pips to get to the high and if we look

316
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,190
for 10 to 20 pips of a sweep above this

317
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,900
high it takes us 10 20 here so 20 pips

318
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,630
40 pips 60 pips 70 pips or so in terms

319
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,450
of potential price range that in itself

320
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,000
is it for the week for me that would be

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,890
it why wouldn't you do anything else and

322
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,130
it's hard to believe but that's how I

323
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,579
operate

324
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,869
I don't look for a whole lot of setups

325
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,089
per week cuz I'm content with you know

326
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,819
doing one thing well and there it is now

327
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,550
if this were a more conservative

328
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,280
approach you could be looking for the

329
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,050
long down here based on the alcohol

330
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,160
trade entry and reaching just to the old

331
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,869
high now if that's the case say you're

332
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,850
filled at well just rounded to one

333
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,660
thirty twenty that again is getting out

334
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,350
at 57

335
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,260
it's 37 pips or so okay almost 40 pips

336
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,440
with us say 40 pips you only need to do

337
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,870
one more trade for the week for 10 pips

338
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,330
to get a 50 pip net return for the week

339
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,220
now there's a lot of folks that will say

340
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,320
don't set targets don't set goals for

341
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,260
daily or weekly because you don't know

342
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,060
what the markets going to do well I

343
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,510
would submit that that's partially true

344
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,970
we don't know with any assurity what the

345
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,240
markets going to do but we do have

346
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,530
pretty strong probabilities of wherever

347
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,350
the market may reach for and if we can

348
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,780
frame the idea of where we're trying to

349
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,340
get in at based on time and price

350
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,040
killzone and such a optimal trade entry

351
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,800
price and where we're reaching for it

352
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,380
doesn't that not offer us a definitive

353
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,570
way of determining what could be

354
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,340
reasonably expected for that particular

355
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,830
setup and if we know that we're looking

356
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,200
at intraday setup like this there's

357
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,990
typically five days per week unless it's

358
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,340
a holiday or the markets are not trading

359
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,830
because of some other bank holiday or

360
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,710
whatever we don't want to trade it we

361
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,570
can see many instances where 25 to 50

362
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,090
pips is rather easy to get now it's when

363
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,430
we get into the I want to make 250 to

364
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,040
500 pips per week then it becomes a

365
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
little daunting in terms of a task so I

366
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,640
think by focusing on 20-25 pips per

367
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,130
setup in an aiming for two good ones per

368
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,510
week I think 50 pips is a really low

369
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,450
hanging fruit reachable achievable and

370
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,450
certainly realistic in the scope of a

371
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,970
developing trader will you get it every

372
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,370
week no will you get it right out the

373
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,940
gate starting using my concepts no but

374
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,860
over time you will eventually grow into

375
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,940
that in an expectancy for a nice return

376
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,070
of 50 pips per week you can frame your

377
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,090
entire career on that
