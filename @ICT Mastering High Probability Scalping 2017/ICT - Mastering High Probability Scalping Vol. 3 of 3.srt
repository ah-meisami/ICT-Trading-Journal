1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,849
okay folks welcome back this is the last

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,570
volume volume 3 of mastering high

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,660
probability scalping and this is dealing

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,880
specifically with previous day bank

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,049
liquidity runs all right for some of you

6
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,940
this is gonna be a little bit of a

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,410
rehash but it's necessary so my dispose

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,489
of this whenever I refer to power 3 what

9
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,680
I'm referring to is the three components

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,710
that make up generic price action that's

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,739
the accumulation phase where long or

12
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,530
short positions are accumulated then a

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,739
manipulation stage where price goes the

14
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,929
opposite direction to what the intended

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:02,210
future direction will actually be

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,040
and then there's an arranged expansion

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,979
and then a distribution

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,370
we use this concept is when the daily

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,340
bias is bullish we're gonna be

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,619
confirming the London session was in

21
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,909
fact bullish that means did we see a

22
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,330
measure of bullishness after a attempt

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,820
to go lower was rejected and price has

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,180
seen a rally this would be enough for me

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,070
coupled with the daily bias being

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,240
bullish

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,520
then you said leave wait until 7:00 a.m.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,619
New York time to stock your long entry

29
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,140
between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. New York

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,409
time typically the setup will form

31
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,460
after 7:00 a.m. New York time you're

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,780
going to be waiting for a price

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,010
retracement lower

34
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,859
New York session will retrace typically

35
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,759
from a swing high intraday that was

36
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,290
formed for the daily high or a

37
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,680
short-term high during the London

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,890
session

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,730
ideally you wanna be selecting

40
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,770
retracements of at least 20 pips are

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,980
lower

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,690
if no retracement of 20 pips forms by

43
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,590
9:00 a.m.

44
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,260
walk that means cut they don't try to

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,740
take any trades if you are exceedingly

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,460
bullish if you see a retracement of 10

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,040
to 15 pips sometimes this is enough

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,220
during this key time of day or a optimal

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,370
train entry long

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,130
you

51
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,490
if it does form enter on the 62 percent

52
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,420
retracement fib as it drops lower

53
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,480
you

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,980
expect price to retest the high of the

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,920
day or the previous day's high and then

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,750
look for targets one two and symmetrical

57
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,010
price swing on the FIB

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,810
as you see here's an example and I have

59
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,420
a vertical line here this is delineating

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,250
seven o'clock in the morning New York

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,290
time or the beginning of the New York

62
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,930
session and price creates a bounce in

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,980
the pre New York session but it's an

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,010
exceedingly large retracement and I'll

65
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,680
talk more about that when we mentioned

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,060
how the time or anticipate reversals

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,980
but after 7:00 a.m. which is that

68
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,129
vertical line we have a retracement of

69
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,700
20 pips actually it's a little bit more

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,079
than 20 pips here but this is a really

71
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,540
good set up but price trades down into

72
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,590
the optimal trade entry and a beautiful

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,230
market run

74
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,290
you

75
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,370
now looking at power 3 again we're

76
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,680
looking at the accumulation phase in

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,539
this case would be the accumulation of

78
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,940
short positions in a manipulation phase

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,949
where a price runs up higher during

80
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,530
London knocking out individuals that

81
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,690
would already be short and putting those

82
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,130
individuals on the wrong side trying to

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,539
glue long and then a nice move lower if

84
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,539
we see this occurring while at the same

85
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,270
time the daily bias is bearish this is

86
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,669
good and again to confirm them on the

87
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,620
session being bearish we want to see

88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,870
price move above the opening price at

89
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,630
midnight New York time if that occurs

90
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,330
and price rejects that goes lower and

91
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,419
trades 25 to 30 pips lower at least

92
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,009
minimum for the London session

93
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,099
that would indicate at least the

94
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,749
expectation that New York sessions

95
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:10,770
should present a continuation idea or

96
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,279
bearishness now obviously you want a

97
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,039
little bit more movement beyond 30 pips

98
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,539
or so for the London session but

99
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,300
nonetheless you want to see that if

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,680
you're staying up and you don't want to

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,319
trade London teaching primarily the New

102
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,589
York session for the scalping model but

103
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,839
if you see the reasons that would

104
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,479
justify a bearish London session that

105
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,909
means again primarily with an open at

106
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,759
midnight New York time and attempt to

107
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,279
rally and rejecting that and trading

108
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,259
significantly off that now again what's

109
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,089
significant yeah 30 pips or more and

110
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:51,300
going into the New York session I want

111
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,439
to I want to dissapoint criteria when

112
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,870
are we waiting for 7:00 a.m. New York

113
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,580
time to stock our short position between

114
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,099
7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. New York time it

115
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:10,289
usually will form after 7:00 a.m. New

116
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,360
York time really waiting for a

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,779
retracement

118
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,770
New York session will typically retrace

119
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,420
from a swing low

120
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,890
now what's swing low the swing low that

121
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,160
was formed in the London decline the

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
initial decline once it starts to

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,630
retrace when we were looking for a price

124
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,260
to move higher

125
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,010
ideally when we selecting retracements

126
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,260
of at least 20 pips or more as it

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,300
retraces higher if their retracement of

128
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,940
20 pips forms by 9:00 a.m. we're gonna

129
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,220
be cutting bait or basically walking and

130
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,540
we'll be looking for another opportunity

131
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,650
the following day

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,169
if it does form we're looking to enter

133
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,960
at the 62% recent level as rallies up

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,150
again important that we want to be

135
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,860
selling short as price goes higher

136
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,569
we'll be anticipating an expecting price

137
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,100
to retest the low of the day

138
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,350
or the previous day's low

139
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,050
and or targets one two and eventually

140
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,340
symmetrical price swinging on the fit

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,100
here's an example here and again the

142
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,309
vertical line delineates the 7 a.m.

143
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:28,909
marker for the New York session so

144
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,709
immediately after that we were gonna be

145
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,669
on watch for a retracement higher of at

146
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,729
least 20 pips now again if you're having

147
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,919
very strong convictions about the market

148
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,099
being very bearish you can anticipate a

149
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:47,299
optimal trade entry form at 15 pips or

150
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,599
so you can get real aggressive if you're

151
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,899
gonna 5-minute chart and take 10 pip

152
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,179
retracements if you're extremely bearish

153
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,309
but that's gonna be for folks that have

154
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,739
done this for a while and has developed

155
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:07,939
a measurable amount of experience I

156
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,589
guess I'm looking for the word that

157
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,079
would best suit it but experience is

158
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,199
going to dictate that but to avoid false

159
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,889
setups it's better to wait for at least

160
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,329
the 20 pips move higher in this case for

161
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,889
a short frost little trade injury but

162
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,119
the key is waiting for a 20 pip rally

163
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,789
after 7:00 a.m. New York time while the

164
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,610
New York session is anticipating a

165
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,708
continuation lower of what was seen in

166
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,360
London so in other words if we're

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,458
looking for bearishness to continue from

168
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,089
a weak sell-off in overnight trading in

169
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,100
London we'll be looking for a

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,199
retracement after 7:00 a.m. New York

171
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,170
time to get a short-term a revolt

172
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,160
condition and that's going to be

173
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,290
capitalized on by an optimal trade entry

174
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,990
short trading short at 62% recent level

175
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,569
and then looking for the intraday low

176
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,720
that was formed to be retested and/or

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,220
the previous day's low and then after

178
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,199
that we would be looking for again

179
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,569
targets 1 2 and symmetrical price swing

180
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,490
on the fib know if you don't know what

181
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,009
those levels are on your fib and you're

182
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,259
watching this video for the first time

183
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,790
and having never seen any of my other

184
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,860
work if you go and look at my youtube

185
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,529
channel inner circle trader it will

186
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,230
obviously show you a optimal trade entry

187
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,120
primer and I'll show you how in that

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,069
video how to set your Fibonacci up so

189
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:35,079
you can see the levels I'm referring to

190
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,540
you

191
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,600
okay when to expect reversals when the

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,280
hourly or 60-minute chart

193
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,430
trades to an obvious old high or old low

194
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,680
that has shown a clear willingness to

195
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,920
reverse price before in the past okay

196
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,910
when it's obviously seen a reaction that

197
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,860
pushes price the opposite direction once

198
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,230
it's been traded to it this is most

199
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,520
likely going to repeat itself

200
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,400
now sometimes price will not respect and

201
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,830
hold high or low and these generic

202
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,450
support resistance levels will give way

203
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,280
and we never really know for sure so I

204
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,790
know what you're going to ask me is how

205
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,190
do I know if the old low or high is

206
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,190
going to hold price and cause it to

207
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,340
reject and go lower or higher and the

208
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,960
answer to that question is I don't know

209
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,800
that

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,540
think about that it's probably

211
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,450
unsettling I'm now I know some of you

212
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,680
want to have that answer and I wasted

213
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,010
years believing I would find it and I

214
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,240
found out you don't need to know that

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,130
sometimes you're gonna mess up sometimes

216
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,450
it's gonna be wrong and sometimes you're

217
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,910
get stopped out and it is what it is you

218
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,649
cannot escape it you're going to lose

219
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,450
money you're going to lose on trades and

220
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,740
there's no reason to worry about

221
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,960
now it's far better to expect them to

222
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,190
cause a reaction than not to why because

223
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,170
there's plenty of moves and price swings

224
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,750
between these key timeframes and higher

225
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,240
time frame price points that you

226
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,640
shouldn't have to worry about it

227
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,410
so there's a plethora of setups that

228
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,910
will be forming between these 60-minute

229
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,730
reversal points are old highs and lows

230
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,440
to not have to worry about it so here's

231
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,250
a little bit of logic for you if you

232
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,660
knew you're about to take a trade and

233
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,600
it's going to quickly encounter one of

234
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,130
these reference points on a 60-minute

235
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,560
chart an old high an old low where it's

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,910
shown classic support resistance

237
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,150
characteristics maybe that's a trait you

238
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,610
don't want to take or if you're going to

239
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,430
do it be very very nimble about where

240
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,800
you're getting out at don't anticipate a

241
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,470
run through that low or that old high in

242
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,020
this example here and this is real-world

243
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,650
examples I've done this actual trade

244
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,270
based on what I'm showing you here this

245
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,320
week it's the time of this recording

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,570
which others and individuals have called

247
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,400
me on Twitter they know exactly what I'm

248
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,710
talking about and you can go look at my

249
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,460
Twitter you'll see it for November 10th

250
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,720
2017 so we have a old low on an hourly

251
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,350
chart here for British Pound USD and as

252
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,570
price trades back down to it you would

253
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,880
anticipate a measurable bounce or

254
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,270
potential reversal so that means we

255
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,410
don't really want to be selling short

256
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,570
around that time because it may

257
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,270
encounter some measure of bullishness or

258
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,540
at least an unwillingness to go lower so

259
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,610
we used allotted that we may anticipate

260
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,160
a rally higher we can look for off the

261
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,139
maternity Long's in a new york session

262
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,660
on a reversal basis not a continuation

263
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,670
of what has been seen overnight in

264
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,940
London so eventually if we see that

265
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,310
60-minute chart

266
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,230
move higher and in break a market

267
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,990
structure as we've seen here then we can

268
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,670
look for the following day to do a

269
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,130
standard classic by day which you'll

270
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,380
learn about my tutorials and the market

271
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,970
trades down gives an optimal trade entry

272
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,720
long at the London open and like myself

273
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,230
here I was only 7 pips away for 50/50 if

274
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,940
you're using the spread from the very

275
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,440
low today calling

276
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,510
about a 80 pip move or so intraday and

277
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,930
very very nice run as a result of it but

278
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,850
the 60 minute charts going to help you

279
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,980
say it and filter when the market much

280
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,610
likely will reverse ok money management

281
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,320
while you develop and practice in your

282
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,540
demo camp it's important for you to

283
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,090
implement strict risk controls no no

284
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,730
this isn't fun isn't sound fascinating

285
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,000
it's not sexy but it really is your only

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,980
protection and in this business you need

287
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,380
everything you can to protect yourself

288
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,860
many times from yourself and if you want

289
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,020
to see what can be accomplished you need

290
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,770
to use how money management now for this

291
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,510
and many of my teachings you're gonna

292
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,720
see me preaching consider one percent

293
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,490
per setup that means one percent of your

294
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,400
total account equity and gradually

295
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,770
working your way up to 2 percent if this

296
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,750
meets your risk tolerance now I'm not

297
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,710
trying to talk you into these

298
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,320
percentages many times some of you whack

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,330
see elect to go with less than 1% and

300
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,340
there's nothing wrong with that some of

301
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,170
you want to be Cowboys and we'll treat

302
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,600
larger than 2% but my advice is if

303
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,460
you've not been profitable for at least

304
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,320
side 5 years minimum

305
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,960
I wouldn't even venture above 2% it's

306
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,870
just not worth it you know it's

307
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,690
important not to try to swing for

308
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,580
homeruns or take larger risk to try to

309
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,560
grow your account faster it's not

310
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,910
necessary it's reckless and you

311
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,430
shouldn't try to do it at all over

312
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,200
leverage will impede your development

313
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,180
and drastically decrease your chances of

314
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,000
seeing responsible equity growth as well

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,920
so if you look at a set as we have here

316
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,330
this is again it's a setup actually took

317
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,120
today in the market at November 10th

318
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,810
2017 in British Pound USD the London

319
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,930
setup I used and this is a London setup

320
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,230
so I'm not really teaching the

321
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,120
application in a New York setup but it's

322
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
the same principle if we are looking for

323
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
an auto trade entry long and this assume

324
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,820
for a moment we were trying to buy at

325
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,520
one-thirty one-twenty our stop loss

326
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,080
relative to the optimal trade entry

327
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,410
pattern and fib would be at 131 big

328
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,379
figures so we have a

329
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,399
PIPP range between entry to stop loss

330
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,419
from a risk base if we had an account of

331
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,089
say $1,000 already modest account and

332
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,789
having 1% of that our risk in dollar

333
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,389
terms would be a total of $10 less

334
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,379
commission and whatever it is that you

335
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,659
would be paying for your broker now that

336
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,979
$10 with 20 pips you divide that $10 by

337
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,919
20 pips and it gives you a multiple or

338
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,309
in this case your demo leverage would be

339
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,109
5 micro lots okay or about 50 cents per

340
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:12,819
pip by having this we know that

341
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:17,319
should not see a larger loss than 1% nor

342
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,869
$10 we took the loss our account with

343
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:23,079
drop down to 990 hours give or take

344
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,239
whatever Commission's your broker may or

345
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,869
may not charge

346
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,019
if we're trying to trade with this model

347
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,939
okay obviously you've seen many

348
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:37,800
instances where I've shown help taking

349
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,670
partial profits can remove that number

350
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,790
one barrier of being able to hold on to

351
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,920
the trade because you want to make a

352
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,379
profit you're afraid to take a loss and

353
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,569
you want to make money by taking partial

354
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,689
profits and in this case it'd be at 1:30

355
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,290
1:45

356
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,619
I'm sorry 130 154 would be our first

357
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,790
profit objective

358
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,120
by taking something off it removes that

359
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,910
insatiable desire to be right you've

360
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,339
taken something off you've reduced risk

361
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,930
but you also gave yourself that little

362
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,579
cookie that little pat on the back you

363
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,280
did something good and at this moment

364
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,890
you can choose to do that or if it

365
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,560
trades up to target one on your fib that

366
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,920
would be in this case 130 169 at that

367
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,420
moment then you can move your stop-loss

368
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,609
to break-even and take no partial and

369
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,950
then try to reach for target 2 and at

370
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,230
that point take a portion of the trade

371
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,150
off and then move to stop-loss just

372
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,350
below 130 154 or where would your top of

373
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,840
your fib would be we've anchored it on

374
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,580
the high point now you can move your

375
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,190
stop-loss just below that and then again

376
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,430
consider taking partial profits at the

377
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,420
symmetrical price wing and maybe leave a

378
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,420
little piece on go further or collapse

379
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,180
it entirely at the symmetrical price

380
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,060
wing the

381
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,120
Effects of money management and the

382
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,960
rules I have I've never been

383
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,140
I guess so rigid in the way I do it I

384
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,750
trade more or less within impulse with

385
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,450
what I feel the markets telling me and

386
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,149
it's hard to digest that and it's all

387
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:19,100
based on tape reading and tape reading

388
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
is you know that's an experiential thing

389
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,529
it's you can't you can't really teach it

390
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:25,909
you can't say here's what here's what

391
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,679
you do it's something you have to learn

392
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,510
by spending years nine days nine four

393
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,230
hours it's not a couple months years of

394
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:44,000
watching price action I've said many

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,500
times now and I'm a dinosaur I'm over 25

396
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,929
years doing this now so there's a lot of

397
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,059
experience and things I've seen that

398
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,649
tend to repeat themselves over and over

399
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:57,289
and over again in price and I'm very

400
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,659
rarely ever shocked or surprised by what

401
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:01,340
I see in price because it's usually the

402
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,830
same type of thing over and over again

403
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,600
but you would think with 25 years plus

404
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,390
doing it I would have a rigid exit

405
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,520
strategy and the closest thing I've got

406
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,559
is using these fibs and what I feel from

407
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,690
the marketplace now some of you will

408
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,730
take this insight that I've shared with

409
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,669
you and build a really strong rigid rule

410
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,980
based idea about when you take profits

411
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,250
and I've actually asked my own

412
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,130
mentorship students if they are able to

413
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,630
come out with something I would love to

414
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,279
be able to see that because I have

415
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,080
always been very honest and said that my

416
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
weakest point in my treating is the

417
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,070
exits I'm never satisfied with them

418
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,059
because I'm trying to crack that as like

419
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,159
entries I got like dialed in I knew what

420
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:48,230
I'm looking for but exits I'm always

421
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,669
looking for a way to improve that

422
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,140
because think about it that's how we get

423
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,210
paid so there's no real hard and fast

424
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,850
rule based you know routine that I do

425
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,309
they always follow it does you know how

426
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,409
much do I take off if I have ten Lots on

427
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,690
you know how many Lots do I take off it

428
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,029
first scale out how many do I take it

429
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,010
target one there's many times where I

430
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,659
won't take anything off at first profit

431
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,179
I'll wait for target one and I'll take

432
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,100
half off there and then I'll take

433
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,809
another portion off at target two and

434
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:18,950
then I'll have something on four

435
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,850
symmetrical price

436
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,559
and then if there's time left in a day

437
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,299
I'll leave another portion on for that

438
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,910
so it's all a matter of what I see and

439
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,410
feel in the marketplace and I know that

440
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,880
probably doesn't satisfy some of you

441
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,940
you're gonna assume and almost feel like

442
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,250
you shoot you're in a position where you

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,620
can demand that I tell you exactly what

444
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,299
I'm doing all the time and this is one

445
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,700
of those I just can't do that I don't

446
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,970
think it's really

447
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,409
a set in stone process that would be so

448
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,200
beneficial for you that you know if you

449
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,309
do it this way all the time

450
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:53,590
it's good enough I've not seen that

451
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,760
among experience so taking profits I

452
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,380
think it's something that's personal you

453
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,360
need to know what you're going to do and

454
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,220
you're gonna spend the rest of your life

455
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,799
you mastering that and never arriving at

456
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,780
mastery so that's gonna be it for this

457
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,990
volume I've covered a really good

458
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,480
approach to breaking down how the finest

459
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,450
setups the currency period you're

460
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,620
probably following if you're just

461
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,390
looking at one it's not going to give

462
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,370
you a set up every single day but if you

463
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,520
have a nice handful of pairs that you

464
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,929
know you're looking for specific

465
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,230
conditions as we outlined it will give

466
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,850
you a set up a couple times a week and

467
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,950
that's all you need you only need 23

468
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,110
pips a week at two percent risk and you

469
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,640
can double your account every single

470
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,980
calendar year by compounding six percent

471
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,679
return six percent a month is not a lot

472
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,330
it's very easy to get to but you have to

473
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,580
know you're looking for first and

474
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,950
hopefully in these three volumes in this

475
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,020
series it's been short enough and

476
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,580
concise enough for you to at least see

477
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,100
what it is that I can point to in a

478
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,710
chart and you can see it too and how it

479
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,620
repeats itself just consistency there's

480
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,070
continuity there is high probability and

481
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,429
it up except for that rule based ideas

482
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,590
that's lacking on the exits because it's

483
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,120
more or less you know you you're gonna

484
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,539
be winging it okay and I wish I could be

485
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,370
stronger in my approach to teaching that

486
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,740
but this is really no way for me to

487
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,620
formulate a always this is the way it's

488
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,010
done I got levels I like and based on

489
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,840
what I see in market action in time of

490
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,450
day because of my experience that'll

491
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,460
tell me what I want to do and it won't

492
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,750
always be the best way of doing it

493
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,549
sometimes it just takes off and goes on

494
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,860
and on and I won't be a part of that

495
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,350
move or sometimes I'm holding for

496
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,120
something like that and it doesn't

497
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,400
really run it just goes to target one or

498
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
maybe it goes up to first profit and I

499
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,659
didn't take anything off there and it

500
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,090
comes back and hits me on my stop so

501
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,500
there's things that you're gonna have to

502
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,870
blur

503
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,960
by experience and I can't teach T no one

504
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,210
else is gonna be able to see either and

505
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,789
you just have to accept that you know

506
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,799
there's gonna be things that you're not

507
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,289
gonna get answers to in trading that

508
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,669
you'll find the closest thing to

509
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,049
answering it by your own discovery and

510
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,120
be excited about that you don't don't

511
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,169
think that you have to know everything

512
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:20,360
right now because you don't there's a

513
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,460
lot of things that you're doing or about

514
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,400
to do or the way you think that's going

515
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,020
to be the impediment when you'd be

516
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,990
coming consistent or profitable at all

517
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,570
the person you sit sit and stare at in

518
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,940
the mirror that person is your biggest

519
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,799
enemy right now because they're telling

520
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
you all the good things and they're

521
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
trying to tell you not

522
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,840
to talk to yourself when you're doing it

523
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,299
wrong okay you need your conscious needs

524
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,600
to be

525
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,530
we need to be sensitive to your

526
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,539
conscience okay if you know what you're

527
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,580
doing is wrong even in a demo account

528
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,640
you need to stop in dis get yourself out

529
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,559
of the marketplace if you're not gonna

530
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,360
be focused and organized don't bother

531
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,330
with it okay but hopefully you've seen

532
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,270
enough with these three videos that I've

533
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,919
given you a way to go into the markets

534
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,140
every single day treating day and look

535
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,520
for opportunities even if it's in

536
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,460
hindsight it's beneficial to study it

537
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,190
but there's something that is specific

538
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,380
that now you can go into price action

539
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,929
and now seek it so many folks when they

540
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,549
first start they put all these

541
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,809
indicators on a chart and all these

542
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,630
