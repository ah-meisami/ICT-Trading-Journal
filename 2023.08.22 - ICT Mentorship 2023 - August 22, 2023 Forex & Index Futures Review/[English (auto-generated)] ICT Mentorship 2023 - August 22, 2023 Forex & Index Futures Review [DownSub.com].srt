00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,679
welcome back folks

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,599
so we're gonna be doing a another quick

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
review here

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,420
I'm gonna try to get to it pretty quick

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,359
I'm still not feeling too well so

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,460
the only chart dollar Index

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,939
you're looking for higher high

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,160
and we got that

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,119
here

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,719
and this is still a potential run even

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,160
though we failed

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,140
to get to it today I'm not convinced

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,180
that we're

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,500
we're done trying to reach with that yet

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,180
so

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,820
a very soft bias for a higher dollar

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,620
[Music]

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,840
you're a dollar you're looking for these

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
relative equal lows we pierced that

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,360
today

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,579
and that doesn't look like it's done so

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,280
but it has take a look at that

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,559
using the inversion pair value Gap I

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,539
chewed up into consequent crochet which

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,300
is this level here

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,659
so we hit that sold off and then dug

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,460
into this sell side

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,080
I think it would be

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,619
more likely to expect a deeper run below

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,840
these lows which is the opposite of what

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
we see or in it what I'm expecting

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,380
rather

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,540
for another higher high on the dollar

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,100
Index and that would be another lower

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,180
low

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,560
for Euro

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,220
four hour chart

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,080
here you can see the relative equal lows

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,240
just pierced it here

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,619
just really

41
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,920
the very difficult rings to trade in

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,619
so again I feel for you if you're in the

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,520
Forex

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,840
that's that class right now

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,280
British pound just to toss Us in here

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,100
you can see this thing is a mess too

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,900
can't get out of this range

48
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,159
[Music]

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,960
and this is what we've been seeing for

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,939
the whole entire month of August

51
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,619
so you want to trade

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,380
in the summer months and try to get it

53
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,259
funded account challenge passed

54
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,759
and good luck

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
that's why I tell you don't do it wait

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,880
until the fall okay

57
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,980
all right s p on the left hand side

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,959
daily chart I mentioned that we would

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,599
likely drop into this Gap here I did not

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,099
have the lines on it but they point to

61
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,140
it last night and I did mention that it

62
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,819
would certainly get to this one here on

63
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,099
NASDAQ we did get to it and through it

64
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,080
up into the very shorter block the

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
opening price here extend that through

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,800
so we can see hit one point trade it all

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
up to the bearish order block and then

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,879
closed on the day with a lower close

69
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,400
than its opening up to the same vein

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,780
that we saw here

71
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,599
for s p and again what I want to see is

72
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,180
do we start to roll over here and make a

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,400
run for the sell side here

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,540
okay

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,739
and

76
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,860
this sell side liquidity pool on the S P

77
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,239
would be where my focus would be

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,120
hourly chart on the s p

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,819
this is the inefficiency on the daily

80
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,800
chart okay let me take you back up to

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
the dealers that we can follow along

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,720
this candle's high this candle is low

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,060
the respective levels here so it's these

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,800
two red levels that makes the spare bag

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,180
up on the daily chart I mentioned last

86
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,260
night

87
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,080
this fair value Gap is for the NASDAQ I

88
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,180
did not include the order Block Level

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,110
here I added that today

90
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,260
[Music]

91
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,360
all right buy side

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
taken look at the bodies respecting the

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,280
lower level that dealing fair value Gap

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,260
then we had the market trading lower

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,540
gravitate back towards the consequent

96
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,220
encouragement of the inefficiency on the

97
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,540
daily chart

98
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,040
straight down to the low or the

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,500
inefficiency just outside of it

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,019
and then the Consolidated inside of that

101
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,700
range

102
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,860
daily bearish order block we traded

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
outside of the inefficiency this is the

104
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,140
high and the low of its respective daily

105
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,299
if everybody got

106
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,280
and we had sell side here so we ran up

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
broke lower consequent encroachment

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,659
which is midpoint between this high and

109
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,400
this low on The Daily fair value Gap

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,220
that's what these two levels are

111
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,799
because encroachments here for that

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,180
and we sold off and they were

113
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,720
consolidated

114
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,880
15 minute time frame you can see how we

115
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,120
each end up in the s p into the low of

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
the daily fair value Gap we were

117
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,780
expecting to be traded to last night

118
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,520
for today's Trading

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,100
Market broke lower

120
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,259
entered all the way down to the low only

121
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,780
down to a lot of daily inefficiency

122
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,960
just a real sloppy afternoon if you were

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,460
to ask me

124
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,680
on the NASDAQ

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,240
you see a trip into the parish order

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
block so we're really in a premium on

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,979
this one and we have relative equal lows

128
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,060
down here where South Side would be

129
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,259
residing

130
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,360
we broke lower we'll look at a smaller

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,979
fair value Gap in here

132
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,320
over time frames we broke lower

133
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,060
Breakaway Gap

134
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,860
unable to get back up into this area

135
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,699
here working over for breaker high low

136
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,660
higher high

137
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,060
consolidation breaks lower attacks the

138
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,810
cell side

139
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,180
[Music]

140
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,820
five minute chart again s p digs into

141
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,000
that daily fair value Gap breaks lower

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
consolidation breaks again and we have a

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,699
nice little fair value Gap there trades

144
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,860
up into it and then the displacement the

145
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,199
lower look at the bodies respecting the

146
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,940
inefficiency here on the cell side of

147
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,620
bounds by side and efficiency

148
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,860
that candles low there's your bodies the

149
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,759
Wicks do the damage

150
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,120
breaks lower the consequent encroachment

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,600
consolidation rather sloppy and digs

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,100
down into the low of the inefficiency

153
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
from the daily chart

154
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,600
NASDAQ

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,039
you see we trade up into the bearish

156
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,780
order block here which is above the

157
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,419
daily inefficiencies High

158
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,039
short term low

159
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
displacement the fair value Gap this is

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,900
model 2022.

161
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,699
sell short

162
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,280
wait for displacement attack this low

163
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,919
here it does creates another

164
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,720
inefficiency here but what is it doing

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
trading inside of this one the high the

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,600
low consequent encroachment consequent

167
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,680

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,820
failed

169
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,600
break lower or sell side right there

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,100
breaks lower

171
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,840
creates a fair value Gap there trades up

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,919
into it

173
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,960
then makes a lower low

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,699
and then consolidates into the close

175
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,539
appreciate your patience with me well

176
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,759
I'm recuperating

177
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,060
and if um I'll obviously chat with you

178
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,380
on Twitter tomorrow

179
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,240
and do another review if it's possible

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,520
until talk to you then be safe
