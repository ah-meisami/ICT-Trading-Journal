1
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,140
okay folks welcome back

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,600
all right so we are looking at another

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,939
discussion and lecture on institutional

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,439
order flow

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,140
and before I get into it I borrowed this

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,000
from a

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,740
another YouTuber

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,200
it's not important who it is and I'm not

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,380
saying that there's anything inherently

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,480
bad about the other YouTuber I'm not

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,100
trying to so Discord or anything like

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,719
that but

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,960
I do see a growing number of you in the

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,660
comments section and folks that email me

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
and or reach out to me through

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
tradingview

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,360
the

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,120
idea of order flow

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,399
using a Dom which is a depth of Market

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,739
which is over here

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,199
on the left hand side and you have the

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,240
footprint which is in the middle of the

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,439
screen here

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,840
see all these little look real technical

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,260
right that's institutional and all this

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,820
down here wow that really makes your

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,760
chart look amazing when I was younger I

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
would have loved to have added all that

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,900
on top of every other indicator I had on

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,759
my chart okay because it would have made

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,500
me feel like I was

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,700
smarter and more informed

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,680
and I want you to think about

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
what it is you're learning from me okay

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,880
if you're new or if you've been with me

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
for a little bit of time

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,280
um

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,619
it can seem a little daunting

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,619
a little complicated if you will and

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,020
it's because you're trying to rush

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,240
through the process and if I were to ask

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,460
you to look at this here look at this

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,740
information

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,479
what should you do with all this now I

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
know how to use this information I know

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,320
how other people use it and I have

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,420
friends and I also have students that

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,880
use things like this in concert with

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,100
what it is that I do and they are

50
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,180
profitable

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,360
so I'm not trying to discourage you

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
from using these tools because if you

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,900
feel like it helps you

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,239
if it's advantageous for you it helps

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,020
you

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,400
Trust

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
your model

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,599
everything I'm saying here today

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,459
if you feel uneasy watching the video

60
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,560
just turn it off

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,319
okay I'm trusting that you're all adults

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
here you can see through what it is I'm

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,520
trying to convey I'm answering the

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,000
question of do I see the necessity for

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,580
these types of things in trading and in

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,140
the short answer that way for folks that

67
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,239
want to know right away and not waste

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,739
any more time

69
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,599
um I don't believe that it's necessary

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,780
to know these things in fact I'm going

71
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,440
to talk about why these are no different

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,080
than any other indicator out there

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,319
because it's a faith-based premise that

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,700
has to be applied to everything whether

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,220
it's my content my Concepts somebody

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,500
else's stuff or even this

77
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,280
um

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
you know

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,519
institutions

80
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,620
that may subscribe to these types of

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
things here

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,080
um it doesn't make prices go up and down

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,640
the only thing really you're doing is

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
with the left hand side over here you

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,659
know the Dom depth of Market

86
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,879
when you see orders

87
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,900
coming forward on that display

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,480
they can be spoofed okay spoofing is

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,459
where in order to be placed above or

90
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,780
below the marketplace

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,500
and pulled away before the market prints

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,319
it and it will look like it'll make it

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,659
look like there's more buying or selling

94
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,640
interest in a particular market so how

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,019
would that be any more

96
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,360
advantages or different really

97
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,280
for a Trader that has to sit down look

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,080
at the market and determine it's going

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
to run from where we are right now at

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
the market price to some previous

101
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
support level so what you expected to go

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
lower or is going to go higher to some

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,420
previous resistance level

104
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,000
okay so you're still met with that same

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
challenge of knowing what you need to

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,140
know where the Market's going to go

107
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,180
okay and there's so many people out

108
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,700
there trying to be Educators trying to

109
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,100
be an influencer trying to convince

110
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,680
other people they can trade

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,100
they are stating these terms here

112
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,580
you don't have to predict the market you

113
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,960
don't have to know where the Market's

114
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,220
going

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,740
and this to me makes absolutely no sense

116
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,380
okay it makes no sense whatsoever

117
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,880
because if you're looking at the depth

118
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,040
of market up here

119
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,259
and the idea is that you think that

120
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,440
there is a more likely okay this is what

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,699
you're going to have to subscribe to

122
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,460
using these types of tools what's more

123
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,560
likely that the market will start to go

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,759
down

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,680
feed into the orders that are below the

126
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,180
marketplace

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,520
or is it more likely to go higher to eat

128
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,900
into diggers that are above the

129
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,520
marketplace

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,240
well I'm not concerned about those small

131
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,160
little fluctuations in price

132
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,540
I mean if you're sitting here trying to

133
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,639
make you know two handles three handles

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,139
those types of Trades you know and

135
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,360
that's your mechanism to do those types

136
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,620
of things I'm not going to sit here and

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,759
try to shoot holes through that because

138
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,380
this is something I would never do that

139
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,180
okay I'm not interested in that type of

140
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,199
trading

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,759
I'm interested in knowing where the

142
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,860
Market's going to reach to and I teach

143
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,600
my students to focus on that primarily

144
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,320
in the early stages of their development

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
depth of Market or level two data

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,720
requires you still

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
to have an opinion

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,460
and that opinion may be incorrect

149
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,320
much like my opinion about the

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,080
marketplace using my own Concepts may be

151
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,300
incorrect just like anybody else we're

152
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,360
still met with the challenge of knowing

153
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,419
the first rule and goal that I teach my

154
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,580
students which is to know

155
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,160
where you trust that the market is more

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,620
likely to draw to higher or lower and

157
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,840
not just for the sake of a few handles

158
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,699
because the depth of market May imply

159
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,039
that there's more buyers

160
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,860
or sellers at any given time just

161
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,660
because there may be printing a depth of

162
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,000
Market ladder which is what these things

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
are called over here these are letters

164
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,979
there may be more orders stacking above

165
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,960
Marketplace

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
or below the marketplace and the idea

167
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,539
generally is

168
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,060
it's more likely doesn't mean it's going

169
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,620
to happen but it's more likely that the

170
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,780
market will gravitate towards where the

171
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,300
larger

172
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,400
stacking of orders if it's more likely

173
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,199
that it's going to go higher then the

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,240
justification should be made that you

175
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,620
need the depth of Market the level two

176
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,600
data that ladder should show a lot more

177
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,060
orders to the upside and then when it

178
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,560
gets there it should eat into that and

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,139
start eroding those orders

180
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,940
that to me

181
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,419
is something that is synonymous with

182
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,380
having a crutch and that's not to be

183
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,720
derogatory I don't mean it in a sense

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,500
that you know nobody should use crutches

185
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,020
you know while they're learning or while

186
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,400
they're using their model if you feel

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,259
like these things are helpful to you and

188
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,360
it helps you focus on sticking to one

189
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,500
side of the marketplace if you have a

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,539
bias if you have a draw on the code that

191
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,360
you feel is going to be booked for that

192
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,099
particular trading session or that day

193
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,740
and this helps you stay focused on it

194
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,660
then that's there's nothing to be

195
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,880
worried about there's nothing wrong

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,620
about that

197
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,580
in my opinion this is all it is and you

198
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,740
have hopefully you can permit me to have

199
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,120
my opinion here

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,660
but the idea of using this stuff

201
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
for the sole basis of whether you should

202
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,099
be a buyer or seller is a little bit

203
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,940
myopic regardless of whether or not an

204
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,900
XYZ trading firm or institution or bank

205
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,840
or whatever has them on their terminals

206
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,460
in their trading floor

207
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,680
it's irrelevant

208
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,440
the market still has that

209
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,020
puzzle of where is it going to go higher

210
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,160
or lower

211
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,740
and when I teach my students to focus on

212
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,360
where the most likely draw on liquidity

213
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,099
is going to be that's what you should be

214
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,360
focusing on

215
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,539
not all these little numbers in here

216
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,120
on a footprint or over here worrying

217
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,139
about

218
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,120
is there more buyers or sellers of other

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Marketplace and it's likely to keep

220
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,020
going up and I I watch a lot of

221
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,900
YouTubers that use these types of tools

222
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,400
over here like the depth of Market the

223
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Dom

224
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,080
it's dumb not dome

225
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,219
but the uh

226
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,140
the idea of using it

227
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,839
if you watch any YouTubers that have it

228
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,219
on their charts or they're live

229
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,779
streaming or maybe they recorded their

230
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,979
their trades and they still have it on

231
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,060
there

232
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,120
um

233
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,500
it doesn't appear at least from my

234
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,180
observations it doesn't appear that it's

235
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,800
all that helpful

236
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
you know even when I can see the market

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,180
is likely to go higher or lower and I'm

238
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
viewing them live streaming or watching

239
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,680
you something in the past when I can see

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,700
what the market has done because I've

241
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,100
either traded it or I can pull it up in

242
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
chart form

243
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,200
I can see how they can be tricked

244
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,420
into thinking oh this I think it's going

245
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,740
to go to this price because there's a

246
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,899
lot of orders around that price

247
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,880
and I want you to think about how what

248
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,220
it is I'm teaching you we're not looking

249
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,040
at the necessity for these types of

250
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
things to confirm anything

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,959
because

252
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,320
my assumptions are you're allowing the

253
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,080
market to be seen visually in chart form

254
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,779
and yes through a time-based chart

255
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,120
there's a lot of advantages if you

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
understand what is I'm teaching there's

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,060
a lot of advantages to using a

258
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,260
time-based chart

259
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,300
where some other individuals out there

260
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,519
that don't have a subscription to the

261
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,860
same view that I have may not like a

262
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,240
Time based chart and they have to

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,880
augment that data and create a new

264
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,060
format of a bar or a candle or something

265
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,459
to that effect

266
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,640
so just know going into this discussion

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,959
I will be

268
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,480
stating why I am not a fan of this

269
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,779
information or these tools do not let me

270
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,060
change your mind if it feels like it

271
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
helps you

272
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,700
if you're profitable and you feel

273
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,800
comfortable using them just because I

274
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,899
may be your mentor

275
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,600
don't let me pry these things out of

276
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,620
your hand

277
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,720
you may grow out of them on your own

278
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,300
over time or you may stick with them and

279
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
it may be part of your repertoire and

280
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,440
there's nothing wrong with that as long

281
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,680
as you're using them in the capacity

282
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,959
that allows you to focus and allows you

283
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,399
to trust your model if that's what

284
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,640
you're using them for there's absolutely

285
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,560
zero hindrances there's nothing I would

286
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,440
never say anything adversely about it

287
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,300
but for someone to come out and say this

288
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,079
is

289
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,700
this is how you read institutional order

290
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,860
flow this is this no you're reading

291
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,899
order flow

292
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,360
but institutional order flow is not this

293
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,060
is not institutional workflow to me this

294
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,220
is this reporting numbers that can be

295
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,560
spoofed that means that they can pull

296
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,899
those orders that means that you may see

297
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,779
them flash on the screen

298
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,459
but doesn't necessarily mean when price

299
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,800
gets to it that those orders are still

300
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,380
there

301
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,480
many trading firms in quote-unquote

302
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,140
institutions have been fined

303
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,240
many many times over

304
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,519
some of them are repeat offenders

305
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,220
some of these trolls I've had over the

306
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,339
years are actually guilty of this

307
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,220
and they were penalized

308
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,779
for spoofing

309
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,940
messing around with placing orders in to

310
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,640
make it look like there's a more

311
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,560
stronger interest to buy or sell a

312
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
particular vehicle or instrument

313
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,579
or Market

314
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,339
and if there's an opening for

315
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,160
manipulation to the data

316
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,519
and that can absolutely be done here

317
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,100
how can you really in my opinion this is

318
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,540
my opinion now I'm not trying to

319
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,760
convince you to not use these things but

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,560
this is my opinion how can you trust

321
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,040
the basis of this data if it absolutely

322
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,800
can be manipulated

323
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,420
if it could be manipulated to make it

324
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,399
look like there is a

325
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,720
fake

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,240
buying interest where orders can be

327
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,880
placed above the market price

328
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,920
or below the market price and the

329
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,140
interpretation of that would be seen

330
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,899
collectively in retail Trading

331
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,300
as there's a lot of a lot of orders

332
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,760
below or below the marketplace and the

333
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,980
tendency is the trust that it's going to

334
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,899
more likely go to where there are more

335
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,880
orders and that's not necessarily what

336
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,260
happens

337
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,120
now I'm sure some of you that use this

338
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
stuff that don't like me you're going to

339
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,300
come out with you know 10 different

340
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,680
examples of where look where it worked

341
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,200
look where but I I promise you I can go

342
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,760
on a live stream and show this stuff and

343
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,860
it not working where my stuff is

344
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,139
absolutely running circles around it so

345
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,820
permit me to say that in this video and

346
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,440
I promise I won't be any more

347
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,200
derogatory the net but now from this

348
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,519
point on I want to kind of show you in

349
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,079
comparing contrast what it is I'm trying

350
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,180
to focus on in my teaching so that way

351
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,339
you're as a student you're looking at

352
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,560
the right way and if you feel like or

353
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,959
you feel pressured by other people that

354
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,839
will say you're you're not learning

355
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,420
real order flow no we're not messing

356
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,800
around with these things here that's

357
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,139
true because it's not necessary

358
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,160
because I want you to understand

359
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
something

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,260
listen to the name

361
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,480
of this stuff here okay the footprint

362
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,360
that means you're looking at something

363
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,779
that's already happened

364
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,480
how many orders were in this part of the

365
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,639
candle this part of the bar

366
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
okay it's already happened

367
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
where have I ever told you to go into

368
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
charts and say here is how many buyers

369
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,079
and sellers have been so repeat what

370
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,579
they've done or use that information and

371
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,500
then you've never heard me say that

372
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,959
I'm always telling you to predict where

373
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,279
price is going to go

374
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,019
and then where you think it's going to

375
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,120
go that draw on liquidity

376
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,620
above the marketplace or below the

377
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,019
marketplace it's going to go up to take

378
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,480
out buy stops or it's going to go up to

379
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,360
reprice to an inefficiency

380
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,680
some kind of FVG or sibi

381
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,880
could be a volume imbalance it could be

382
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
a institutional overflow entry drill

383
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,279
yeah it could be a consequent quotient

384
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
of a wick

385
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,899
there's very specific things that we're

386
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,880
looking for but not every single Market

387
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,519
at that time frame in that chart fractal

388
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,660
that portion of price that you're

389
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,760
studying is going to have every single

390
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,100
thing that I have as a PD array

391
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,040
something that I teach you to focus on

392
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,560
but the ones that are actually there you

393
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,660
have to consider them and know what to

394
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,800
do with them and navigate them

395
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,980
so I'm teaching you absolutely how to

396
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,600
predict price because

397
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,399
how else are you going to use this

398
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,579
information and trust it

399
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,980
I'll post the question to you like this

400
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,940
if you are bearish on the marketplace

401
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,380
doesn't it make sense that if you're

402
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,940
going to be using these tools

403
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,639
that you're expecting

404
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,040
the depth of Market to show a lot more

405
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,740
orders below the marketplace

406
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,339
a lot more interest to draw price into

407
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,380
lower prices

408
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,920
because

409
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,720
you're bias

410
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,060
you're

411
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,820
directional bias your analysis you are

412
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,699
bullish or bearish so you're going to go

413
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,100
in into this data looking for those

414
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,560
things to justify what your your

415
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,899
analysis

416
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,000
so I don't go to the middleman these are

417
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,480
all middleman ideas to me and it's

418
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
helpful in the beginning if you don't

419
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,899
know what you're doing and how to

420
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,760
navigate price action and you want to

421
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,199
see the underpinnings of what the

422
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,880
Market's doing and how it books price

423
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,579
that's wonderful but my PD arrays are

424
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,800
always always

425
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
ahead of this

426
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,899
it's always ahead of it

427
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,000
look at what I did this week with the

428
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,220
analysis on the July 9 2023 video I did

429
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,019
on Sunday before the market opened up I

430
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,240
told you exactly what we would be seeing

431
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,920
I told you what would be expected in

432
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,899
terms of price delivery and it delivered

433
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,699
perfectly

434
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,600
flawlessly

435
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,760
no necessity on having any of this stuff

436
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,620
here so really

437
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,320
I want you to compare and contrast

438
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
if this is measuring minute by minute

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,000
second by second real events of

440
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,899
transactions because that's what this

441
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,579
all this is showing you is transactions

442
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,720
but just because there was a certain

443
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,339
number of buyers or sellers at a

444
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,480
particular price

445
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,160
at any given time

446
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,500
and just because there are more orders

447
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
above or below the market price in the

448
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,740
Dom has absolutely no bearing on future

449
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,359
prices

450
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,880
it has absolutely no bearing on the

451
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,699
future direction of price

452
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,040
the markets stay stagnant and stays

453
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
disconsolidating

454
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,459
when this stuff was a big buzz

455
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,459
when I first started using it when level

456
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,679
two became a thing and I'm old enough

457
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,360
and I watched the transition from open

458
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,820
outcry into electronic Trading

459
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,380
when these tools were made available to

460
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,179
us everybody was clamoring to it because

461
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,400
level two that was the thing you were

462
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,720
really informed if you had this

463
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,100
information

464
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,620
where's all the yachts

465
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,179
where's it where's all the billionaires

466
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,160
and the millionaires if it was going to

467
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,780
make you institutional

468
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,940
minded

469
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,980
where's all the rich people that came up

470
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,980
out of nowhere using it

471
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,600
right

472
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,080
so

473
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,039
not to discourage you

474
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,340
but when I say institutional order flow

475
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,799
it's not this

476
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,500
you know you'll hear people say

477
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,480
um ICD doesn't teach order flow I don't

478
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,980
teach this stuff

479
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,780
because this stuff I have no faith in

480
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,780
and I know how to use it but I

481
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,700
completely cut it out of my analysis

482
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,940
because I don't need it you might need

483
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,980
it you may find

484
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,860
helpfulness from it it may allow you to

485
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,299
feel closer to the marketplace and if

486
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,220
that's what you're feeling by doing it

487
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,980
that there's nothing wrong with that

488
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,820
absolutely nothing wrong with it like

489
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,860
I've already stated earlier I have

490
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,100
friends in this industry and I have

491
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,200
students that use this stuff in

492
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,940
conjunction

493
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,160
with what I'm teaching

494
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,500
and they're profitable

495
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,799
so I'm not here to say this doesn't work

496
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
okay what I'm doing is I'm drawing a

497
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,299
stark contrast between when I say

498
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,980
institutional order flow what am I

499
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,620
talking about in contrast to this stuff

500
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,320
here that's what we're going to do okay

501
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,640
so

502
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,840
let's move on into the discussion here

503
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
we're going to look at a case study on

504
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,179
NASDAQ okay and

505
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,059
I'm going to spare you level two data

506
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,320
because it's not required it's not

507
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,700
necessary and I want you to think about

508
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,980
how it is that I teach you and how I've

509
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,940
shown

510
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,820
a plethora of examples of before the

511
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,320
fact where the market is going to go how

512
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,539
it's going to get there not just here we

513
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,340
are at Point a I believe it's going to

514
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,020
maybe get up the point B that's not what

515
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,179
I say I say this is where I think the

516
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,039
draw of liquidity is that means I'm

517
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,299
cosigned

518
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,059
that's a directional bias that means I

519
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,059
have made my expectations known publicly

520
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,919
beforehand

521
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,539
and it's not a two pip or five handle

522
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,860
expectation these are pretty considered

523
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,460
price moves

524
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,520
and I'm not utilizing anything that is

525
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,799
classically lumped into order flow

526
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,820
because

527
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,679
folks that use that information when I

528
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,299
say

529
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,080
um

530
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,820
trading with institutional order flow

531
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm seeing institutional order flow in

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
price action I'm going to cover that

533
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,539
again today I've done it in the past but

534
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,919
I want to present a little bit deeper

535
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,100
presentation about it and I want you to

536
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,039
think about the

537
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,520
the lack of

538
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,380
required tools

539
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,900
that other people other Traders feel

540
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,760
like they have to have when I have

541
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,340
nothing on my chart is simply a

542
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,380
Candlestick chart and I'm as long as I

543
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,480
can see what time it is and where we are

544
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,980
in the range

545
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,980
that's it that's all you need

546
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,179
so

547
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,220
the number one thing is draw on

548
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,100
liquidity so I was bullish

549
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,520
obviously I mentioned that last Sunday

550
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,580
and today is July 16th 2023 at the time

551
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,080
of this recording

552
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,299
so last Sunday

553
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,500
July 9th 2023 I had outlined my

554
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,080
expectation of higher prices on

555
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,679
e-mini s p NASDAQ

556
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,660
higher prices on euro dollar and lower

557
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,480
prices on the dollar Index and it was a

558
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,220
clean sweep everything delivered as I

559
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,980
expected they were not small moves they

560
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,480
were rather large

561
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,059
and I want to go into detail as to why I

562
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,299
believed that NASDAQ would go higher

563
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,520
and I want you to take a look at the

564
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,539
chart here

565
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,460
upper left hand corner this is the

566
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,919
weekly chart

567
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,320
this right here this candle right here

568
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,020
is a mitigation block now I don't talk

569
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,520
too much about it

570
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,120
but it is basically the opposite of a

571
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,500
breaker but they are still both

572
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,559
mitigation in essence

573
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,659
now

574
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,799
we have a high a low and a higher high

575
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,940
no

576
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,600
lower high you see that that low between

577
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,179
it is a mitigation block if this High

578
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,419
here

579
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,520
was taken out with a higher run here

580
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,260
then that would be a bearish breaker

581
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:36,220
bearish Breakers are much more stronger in terms of resistance than a mitigation block 
a mitigation block can be traded through
- so in terms of how I use mitigation blocks, 
- I typically side with using them as targets more so than entry
- because they can be traded through

591
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,960
Breakers are kind of like they're

592
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,059
they're pretty formidable in the path of

593
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,200
price action it doesn't mean that they

594
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,059
can't go through them it doesn't mean

595
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,039
I've never had a losing trade using a

596
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,559
breaker because I have but

597
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,440
mitigation blocks are better used for

598
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,600
targeting purposes I was using this one

599
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,340
here with the expectation that the nasda

600
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,140
could try to gravitate towards that if

601
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
it were to go any higher this small

602
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,380
little if everybody got there and

603
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,840
obviously the buy side above it so I am

604
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,260
not called a high in the NASDAQ or ES in

605
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,700
fact you've heard me emphatically State

606
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,320
many times throughout the commentaries

607
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,059
and or Twitter

608
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,240
that I am not calling a high

609
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,220
and it's important for you not to try to

610
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,679
do that too look out just keeps drilling

611
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,580
higher it's grinding people down anybody

612
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,960
that wants to sell short this Mark and

613
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
believe me I'm in the opinion as well

614
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,799
that there's no justification for the

615
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,020
markets to be where they are at least

616
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,179
for equities your stocks should not be

617
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,880
trading where they're at but

618
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,520
we have to trust order flow what kind of

619
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,020
order flood the things I started to show

620
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,740
you in the beginning of this

621
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,900
presentation I don't subscribe to those

622
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,039
things

623
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,220
I don't have any faith in them

624
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,679
my faith is based on where I believe the

625
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,299
Market's going to go so yes I believe

626
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,159
I'm pretty good at predicting where

627
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,720
price is going to go because I have

628
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,820
experience doing it and I have tools

629
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,740
that help me to do that and I also can

630
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,960
see where orders are going to be anyway

631
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
before your ladders your depth of Market

632
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
before your footprint confirms what I

633
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,940
already and my students already expect

634
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,700
in terms of price delivery

635
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
we already know there's going to be

636
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,059
buying and selling between the two price

637
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,539
points that we're at that that's a given

638
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,039
so knowing where the market is going to

639
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,799
go to that's a directional bias you

640
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,500
listen at some point folks unless you

641
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,740
trade options in your delta neutral

642
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,659
have a directional bias

643
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,140
there's no way around it you have to

644
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,640
otherwise your writing options

645
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,799
so if we're trading futures

646
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
and we're

647
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,700
trying to be a buyer or seller I mean if

648
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,380
you're going long

649
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,500
then you have a bias that's going higher

650
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,220
so why why argue with that why call it

651
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,780
something that it's not you're

652
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,340
predicting Christ you're trying to

653
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,220
predict price then say

654
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,159
we don't need to predict the future

655
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,440
price Direction well yes you do if you

656
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,700
want to be profitable or at least

657
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,460
consistently profitable

658
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,840
like you have to have an understanding

659
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,360
of where the market can gravitate

660
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,280
towards and that's what I teach my

661
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,720
students that's the first thing they

662
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
come out of the gate with with me is

663
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,100
knowing where price is likely to go if

664
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,620
you don't have that skill set you will

665
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,480
not be consistently profitable period

666
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,460
end a story there's nothing else to

667
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,760
discuss

668
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,740
so my opinion was in the beginning of

669
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,000
the week

670
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:50,919
I wanted to see us gravitate towards this MB
it would be above the REHs here that had already been cleared through here and we Consolidated 
markets don't talk like that
okay and it was more likely that we're going to expand higher 
it did 
it reached into the MB

679
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,659
it actually closed right on it so that's

680
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,299
that's rather decent isn't it

681
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,900
so ahead of the week open

682
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,279
on Sunday July 9 2023

683
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,880
we were expecting price to go higher

684
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,919
and we have

685
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,260
this candle right here now on this

686
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,120
candle stick chart here in the lower

687
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,380
left hand corner this is a daily chart

688
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,900
of the NASDAQ everything that I'm

689
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,279
teaching you here folks you may be

690
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,799
primarily a Forex Trader okay

691
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,720
everything that I'm teaching you right

692
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,960
here works on every asset class

693
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,240
I would not do anything different so

694
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,940
that way if you're frustrated because

695
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,440
I'm not talking about Forex like it did

696
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,580
a lot

697
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,640
before I'm teaching through this medium

698
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,260
here because this is where actually got

699
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,919
started in 1992 I was a commodity Trader

700
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
so this is where I started

701
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,600
later on in my career I moved and

702
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,179
transitioned to Forex

703
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,279
there's a lot of things that

704
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,260
prevent me from wanting to trade Forex

705
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,880
so that's the reason why I'm teaching

706
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,740
with this medium here everything that

707
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm teaching you here with Futures index

708
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,380
trading Works in 4x2 it works in

709
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,720
commodity trading it works in Gold it

710
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,360
works in metals and my students I can't

711
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,799
swear by it because I've never traded

712
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,900
crypto but I have students that have

713
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,760
been profitable trading crypto using

714
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,980
this information so that way

715
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,020
at least you know that somebody else out

716
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,900
there other than me has some experience

717
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,980
with it because I don't have any

718
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,059
experience trading crypto

719
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,659
so if

720
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,159
we see this down closed candle after if

721
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,240
you look at the weekly chart here

722
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
there's a small little Fair bit you got

723
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,919
right in there

724
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,919
that's this one here on the daily

725
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,020
so the market traded higher there and

726
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,580
then we have this down closed candle

727
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,279
which is

728
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,080
right above and digging into this down

729
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,880
closed candle this is an older Block

730
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,600
it's bullish this is a propulsion block

731
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:40,360
PB are OB by themselves but the way you differentiate what they are and how they're used is

this down-closed-candle digs into a previous down-close-candle
so an OB that has another OB that digs into it 

PB you never want to see a closing price below MT
MT on our OB is the 50 level
we Wicked down through it but then closed here this one here 
we Wick down through it and closed right here 
we Wicked down through it and closed up here 

so yes we had the movement through the MT but we didn't close below it 
so that still keeps this down closed candle valid as a PB

751
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,220
I promise you we're going somewhere

752
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,140
Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday

753
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,880
Monday's Trading

754
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,100
all of this movement here

755
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,600
was just returning back into this Gap

756
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,760
this tail and this Candlestick we treat

757
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,940
Wicks and Tails on candlesticks as gaps

758
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,120
midpoint of that Gap or tail on that

759
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,159
candle is consequent encouragement

760
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,720
extend out in time you can see that's

761
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,059
exactly where we were trading on Monday

762
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,480
it did not violate the rules that make a

763
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,779
propulsion block invalid

764
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,520
market closes here

765
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,860
and now we open the next day we open the

766
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,179
trade down

767
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,700
rally back up and have it I'll close

768
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,220
so the next two days we had news

769
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,860
we had a pretty good uh economic

770
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,080
calendar events for the rest of the week

771
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,440
and it's sent price parabolic above the

772
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,240
REHs so the draw on

773
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,340
liquidity is the weekly chart

774
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,899
mitigation block

775
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,179
okay so we're not going to say that the

776
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,520
actual price was 15 693 but we're just

777
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,539
going to use it for the sake of

778
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,220
discussion because

779
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,720
I don't know it off the top of my head

780
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,220
what the actual price was I haven't

781
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,600
noted here

782
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,640
you're invited to do that in your own

783
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,980
study don't just take what I show and

784
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,299
talk about in the video you need to go

785
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,980
in there and weigh out whether your

786
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,799
charts show you the same thing because

787
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,360
you want your own proof you don't want

788
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,279
to just take my word on anything in fact

789
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,380
that's the best way to do it challenge

790
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,960
yourself and challenge my observations

791
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,600
was it really there in the chart because

792
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,640
you know just taking my word for anyone

793
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,320
else's word for anything is is not

794
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,460
something you should do especially

795
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,399
investing in financial advice

796
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,080
so

797
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,720
this movement here this was fully

798
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,700
expected we are expecting this

799
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,340
bullishness in higher prices on NASDAQ

800
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,899
when you're expecting it and yes as well

801
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,419
you mean s p

802
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,360
but we look for things to start or

803
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
instigate a price rally higher or a

804
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,580
price decline lower

805
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,460
and we frame it on the basis of where

806
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,740
are we at right now versus where is it

807
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,179
likely to go

808
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,039
so if we think that the price is going

809
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,299
to gravitate

810
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,159
up to this area here

811
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,720
and we'll call it fifteen thousand six

812
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,520
ninety three and

813
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,700
0.75 if we start the week here Monday

814
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,679
and then Tuesday and Wednesday and

815
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:05,940
Thursday and Friday

816
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:28,539
we expect each daily candle to gravitate towards that level even if you didn't pick that level 
if you felt that this FVG was a reason to keep going higher, that's fine
that's nothing there's nothing wrong with that 
but this mitigation block is below that FVG
and if you are using the REHs as a drawing liquidity there's nothing wrong with that either

828
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,419
remember the only thing we're doing is

829
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,640
primarily looking for the expansion

830
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,520
either higher or lower

831
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,860
on the weekly Candlestick that sets our

832
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,440
bias for the week so is it more likely

833
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,419
to see where price was consolidating

834
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,399
here is it more likely it's going to

835
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:48,899
drop down after we've already went into

836
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,659
this Fair Bay Gap here we already did

837
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,399
that and then we Consolidated here the

838
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,320
previous week and then we start a new

839
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,760
week here trade down a little bit and

840
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,500
then reject it

841
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,360
which is all that rejection is based on

842
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,799
this consequent correction this daily

843
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,120
candle right there that's where the low

844
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,279
of the week was formed

845
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
so this is primed to just obviously

846
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,820
expand higher and aggressively above

847
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,260
these REHs on the daily

848
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,480
chart so there's buy orders resting

849
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,580
above that

850
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:30,320
markets don't top like this folks 
they don't do it and since the weekly in a daily chart are showing this pattern
it's more likely to go higher especially since we were bearish on dollar 
not just bearish a little bit but we were exceedingly bearish expecting it to reach for a larger pool SSL

859
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,820
so if that is the case that means it's

860
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,740
definitely a risk on scenario meaning

861
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,919
all assets have the likelihood

862
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,980
to go higher Euro

863
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,500
pound gold

864
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,899
all other asset classes are free to move

865
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,659
higher because it's risk on and we saw a

866
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,120
huge risk on event this past week where

867
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,840
most asset classes went up

868
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,220
while the dollar crashed

869
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,460
over here on the hourly chart I want to

870
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,799
to notice this little shade layer here

871
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,419
that's the propulsion block

872
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,880
that's this whole range here but visible

873
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,580
on a hourly chart

874
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,460
so we have relative equal lows here we

875
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,980
drop down into it we trade above this

876
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,539
short term high right there that's all

877
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,340
it needs to that that's a shift in

878
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,419
Market structure it doesn't need to

879
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,519
close above it

880
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,740
it just now sets the thing in motion

881
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,940
that we're going higher

882
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,559
doesn't mean you can't have retracements

883
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,419
but look where it retraces if you take

884
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:37,380
this

885
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,539
propulsion block right here and you

886
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,299
divide it in half that's MT

887
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,399
that's what this drop was going to right

888
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,600
there

889
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,279
it's going right there and it's also

890
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,880
cleaning up these smooth edges in the

891
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,779
bodies

892
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,460
wait a minute that's not smooth edges

893
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,860
ICT look at this Wick right here or this

894
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,320
tail and look at this right here

895
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:11,440
look at the bodies the bodies tell you the story 
that's the narrative 
the Wicks do all the damage 
that's the stuff that everybody gets hurt by 
you get stopped out and you don't want to go back into the marketplace 
that's their purpose

902
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,879
reading price action with a time-based
chart and focusing on the bodies of the candles 
if you just saw these right here like this and there was no Wicks or tails on their candlesticks 
if you took that completely off your chart this would look like Smooth edges

909
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,339
and that's all this was trading down

910
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,918
into MT which is the entire

911
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,839
range from high to low

912
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,820
split that in half

913
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,859
that's this level right here

914
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,780
that's occurring

915
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,820
right in this level

916
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,980
digging into it after we had a shift in

917
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,719
Market structure so what am I saying

918
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,918
here

919
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,719
at this point

920
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,359
right there that's slightly higher high

921
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,619
than this one

922
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,839
because we've had cell side taken there

923
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,140
now we have buy side we're bullish so we

924
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,420
have now met the minimum criteria for

925
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,880
high probability directional bias

926
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
so now we can absolutely predict higher

927
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,220
prices we can trust that higher prices

928
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,740
are likely to go where

929
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,240
up in here

930
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,980
this mitigation block

931
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,960
so if we're looking for a 15 693 level

932
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,720
and we're down here and we drop down to

933
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,599
MT at that point does the

934
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,339
market want to Rally away from it sure

935
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,500
looks like it does to me

936
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,780
tries one more time

937
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,520
digs into it but look where the bodies

938
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,720
are showing

939
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,780
they're showing it's respecting that

940
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,359
propulsion block right there we've

941
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,440
already did the damage we're going down

942
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,579
into it

943
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,280
and here bodies are supporting the high

944
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,560
end of the propulsion block that shaded

945
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
area and then we want to see does the

946
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,460
market want to Rally well here's the

947
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,200
thing if you're looking at depth of

948
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,480
Market or if you're looking at footprint

949
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,040
you're going to start seeing

950
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,200
all the things

951
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,060
that would justify

952
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,400
the market wanting to go higher

953
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,260
we already knew that

954
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,660
we already knew all those things and

955
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,980
from here

956
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,540
as soon as we get these candlesticks

957
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,040
showing this and this Candlestick closes

958
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
the next candle here and it drops down

959
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,300
and touches this the high of this blue

960
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,760
shaded area which is this candle that

961
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,740
range on the daily chart we're working

962
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,619
with the hourly chart here now

963
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,180
I know

964
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,119
that we're likely to go higher where we

965
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,920
have all this sell side imbalanced bison

966
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,140
efficiency so basically this candle

967
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,599
sticks low and then we have the buy side

968
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,579
above this High here there's buy stops

969
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,619
resting above that

970
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,880
but this also is another pattern

971
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,500
it's a breaker

972
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,680
so I know that everyone that uses a

973
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,960
depth of Market uses a footprint they're

974
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,579
going to be looking for justifications

975
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,040
to go higher or lower the folks that

976
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,119
would be looking at it with the

977
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,500
expectation that the Market's going to

978
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,420
go higher the evidence that they're

979
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
seeking will be there

980
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,339
every instance of it

981
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,500
would be reflected in those tools I

982
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,820
don't need to see that I already know

983
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,980
that the Market's going to go towards

984
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,980
these levels it's driven that way not

985
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,260
because of buying and selling pressure

986
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,480
I have already arrived at these ideas

987
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
before the markets even opened up

988
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,820
before the market even printed its first

989
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,460
book

990
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,619
on Sunday's opening

991
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,140
we had already codified the expectation

992
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,060
that these markets were going to go

993
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,180
higher and to where

994
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,339
there was no need there was no way for

995
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,440
me to look at depth of Market or a

996
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
footprint to justify those things

997
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,320
because the market hadn't already done

998
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,180
anything yet

999
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,660
so while the markets were static

1000
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,119
using experience using institutional

1001
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,460
order flow reading the tea leaves okay

1002
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,680
reading price action so for the folks

1003
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,180
out there to say you know if you're

1004
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,740
reading the tape who said this is

1005
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,300
reading take folks you're watching price

1006
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,480
and how it gyrates off of my PD arrays

1007
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,460
that's reading the tape when someone

1008
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,260
says show me your order book show me

1009
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,480
your order book that's the stuff at the

1010
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,680
beginning of this video that I don't

1011
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,000
need

1012
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,060
before your order book before your depth

1013
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,579
of Market before your ladder in your

1014
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,920
footprint tools start telling you

1015
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,380
anything I have already I'm light years

1016
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,359
ahead

1017
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,260
the footprint

1018
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,920
that's something that is happened

1019
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,020
this is where the buyers were this is

1020
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,720
how many orders were bought and sold at

1021
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,920
these specific levels okay that's

1022
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,839
wonderful that's wonderful history I

1023
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,060
loved it when I was in school

1024
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,700
but who has a better perspective folks

1025
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,760
okay someone that's ahead of you on the

1026
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,720
path

1027
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,520
that you're walking right now

1028
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,500
someone that is

1029
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,660
a quarter mile up the road

1030
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,980
they've already walked this path

1031
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,079
multiple times many times they know the

1032
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,060
terrain they know where the sticks are

1033
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,460
out and the Thorns are and who has the

1034
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,320
better perspective you as an

1035
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,880
inexperienced student of the marketplace

1036
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
someone that's new maybe you started in

1037
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,940
2015

1038
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,540
you're looking back

1039
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
and wondering can you trust these tools

1040
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,940
when I'm ahead of you in experience and

1041
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,920
I can read these charts without any of

1042
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,560
that stuff and I know where you're going

1043
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,480
to see new buying entries you're going

1044
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,220
to see retracements that take out

1045
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,119
liquidity you're going to see

1046
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,320
inefficiencies and how they're going to

1047
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
use those inefficiency and I've proven

1048
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,540
this numerous times with live executions

1049
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,300
I've called the market minute by minute

1050
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,060
live on a live stream not pre-recorded

1051
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,280
you have all sat there and watched me do

1052
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,980
this that is reading the tape I don't

1053
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,859
need these gimmicks to talk about what's

1054
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,720
happened already

1055
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,359
I don't need to see that order book I'm

1056
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,619
going to tell you where the Market's

1057
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,240
going to go before the order books talk

1058
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,380
about it

1059
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,079
that's what my students are able to do

1060
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,720
you may not have that skill set yet you

1061
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,099
will over time it doesn't happen

1062
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,980
overnight it doesn't happen real quick

1063
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,920
but I promise you the idea of these

1064
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,740
things that are being promoted as this

1065
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,359
is institutional order flow it's not

1066
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,180
institutional order flow

1067
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,940
all you're seeing is a glorified time

1068
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,040
and date stamp

1069
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,380
time and sales that's it

1070
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,240
that's all you're seeing it's a it's a

1071
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
repackaged edition of that same

1072
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,180
information

1073
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,339
that's wonderful that's wonderful for

1074
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,320
data collection and and studying okay

1075
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,640
it's wonderful

1076
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,640
but you still are left with the puzzle

1077
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,680
of where is Price going to go higher or

1078
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,060
lower

1079
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,980
and in between where we are at market

1080
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,980
price how will it behave

1081
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,500
well let's talk about that

1082
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,119
if this is the propulsion block and

1083
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,440
we've already seen it dig down into here

1084
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm not looking at ladders I'm not

1085
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,020
looking at depth of Market I'm not going

1086
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,820
to look at that level two data I'm not

1087
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,140
looking at anything harmonic I'm not

1088
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,339
looking at animal patterns I'm not

1089
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:57,540
looking at Elliott wave I'm not looking

1090
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,020
again I'm not looking at anything

1091
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,140
but this price action right here

1092
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,540
now what's more simplified

1093
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,560
trying to determine the efficacy of of

1094
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,400
footprint a depth of market and then not

1095
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,440
trading with the expectation of

1096
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,320
predicting price to me that's

1097
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,720
that's Insanity like how could you

1098
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,359
possibly know what to do

1099
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,980
and then it's not surprising when you

1100
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,359
see everybody out there that are trying

1101
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,240
to live stream and use these tools they

1102
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,280
fumble or they're not very confident

1103
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,260
when it is discussing what it is they

1104
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,240
want to do

1105
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
and one of the things I get challenged

1106
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,560
with is you know I I'm arrogant no I'm

1107
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,780
confident and my students that are

1108
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,980
profitable that know what they're doing

1109
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,599
they're confident and it seems like

1110
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,240
arrogance the people that can't do it

1111
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,339
and I'm just trying to communicate to

1112
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,200
you in a manner where I don't want you

1113
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,060
to view me as trying to be arrogant I

1114
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,200
want you to learn how to do this

1115
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,359
yourself if I was trying to hold it back

1116
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,660
from you then I could see your argument

1117
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,660
but I'm trying my best to teach it to

1118
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,820
you and I'm trying to disarm you for

1119
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,140
those that are standing here trying to

1120
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,060
arm wrestle me and say you know this is

1121
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,320
fake or you don't know what you're doing

1122
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,180
and it's always hindsight when I have

1123
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,140
literally scores of executions and live

1124
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,940
streams where I've called these things

1125
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,680
before they happen

1126
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,540
and your ladders and your depth of

1127
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,760
market and all this footprint stuff

1128
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,359
hasn't even spoke to you yet

1129
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,280
I'm light years ahead I'm ahead of you

1130
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,800
in the path okay and I'm looking back at

1131
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,780
you I know where I've come from I've

1132
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,119
been exactly where all of you are I've

1133
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,079
been there

1134
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,060
and I understand how confusing it is and

1135
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,320
you're trying to determine what you're

1136
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,160
supposed to do with this information

1137
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,440
it's a lot of stuff to understand I

1138
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,119
understand that's normal

1139
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,099
I didn't say it was going to be easy

1140
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,040
but I will make it easy and how I'm

1141
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,140
teaching you this year there's no other

1142
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,000
way to simplify it

1143
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,680
there really isn't it says you have to

1144
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,940
keep doing it for a while and you'll

1145
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,700
learn how to do it but when I look back

1146
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,880
at you as someone that's starting

1147
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,740
I have the advantage of knowing how

1148
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,140
price will deliver

1149
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,859
I know how Market structure will use

1150
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,140
specific things that I've dubbed PD

1151
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,420
arrays you don't know where they're

1152
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,440
going to form or how they're going to

1153
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,700
form I do

1154
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
and I've proven that with live streams

1155
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,560
live with the lowest latency that

1156
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,900
YouTube can permit

1157
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,000
so there's no excuses there's absolutely

1158
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,700
no arguments there's none

1159
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,940
order books are not advantageous to me I

1160
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,740
don't need those things and if you're

1161
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,240
learning how to do what it is I'm

1162
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,280
teaching you you don't need those tools

1163
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,960
either but if you want to use them to

1164
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,480
help you and you find advantages in

1165
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,520
using it that's wonderful I'm not going

1166
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,740
to tell you to put it down

1167
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,720
but if we're expecting price to go up to

1168
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,700
this blue line and we're seeing evidence

1169
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,980
that all these things down here stops

1170
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,380
have been taken is swept we have all

1171
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,880
these bodies here which is relative

1172
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,700
equal lows forget the Wicks go back into

1173
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,839
the bodies they're telling you the

1174
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,760
narrative that's the storyline that

1175
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,720
means they're going to want to sweep

1176
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,220
through it there you go it's happening

1177
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,619
right there so when this is a full my

1178
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,480
bearish candle I would be buying that

1179
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,880
you probably wouldn't most people on

1180
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,560
YouTube Twitter and Instagram and

1181
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,359
Discord and things like that wouldn't

1182
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,619
buy that

1183
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,119
they would be too afraid they had no

1184
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,000
idea price would react that way

1185
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,520
but I'm leaning on this being a

1186
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,680
propulsion block this is a order block

1187
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,180
that's already confirmed that it is

1188
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,020
we broke through

1189
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,220
this candle's closure here which is

1190
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,260
rejection Block it's showing a

1191
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,460
willingness to want to go higher I don't

1192
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,560
need this High to be taken now

1193
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,280
it's went above this one here while I'm

1194
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,500
bullish this down closed candle is a

1195
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,760
propulsion block so that range I'm

1196
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,980
shaded here I'm putting that and

1197
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,619
transposing that onto an hourly chart

1198
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:57,420
so I'm watching price action on an

1199
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,000
hourly basis how it performs see when

1200
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,380
I'm doing my live streams or if I'm

1201
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,079
doing a execution and I'm recording my

1202
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,400
trades

1203
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,099
I don't have four laptops folks okay

1204
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,240
I've had laptops you know numerous

1205
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,000
laptops over the years and I kill them

1206
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,660
I burn them out and once they're done or

1207
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,400
close to being done I take all the

1208
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,140
information off them and they're dead

1209
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,579
they're thrown away there's nothing I

1210
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,140
can do with them

1211
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,780
but I have many monitors in front of me

1212
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,400
on my system and I've showed you that on

1213
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,020
my YouTube

1214
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,880
I showed you my displays I showed you

1215
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,079
what it looks like

1216
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,480
and I'm watching different layouts and

1217
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,700
one of the layouts I use has very

1218
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,900
similar to what you're seeing here where

1219
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,079
we have multiple time frames and I'm

1220
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,540
watching how price delivers on all of

1221
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,920
them I'm not just staring at a one

1222
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,180
minute chart

1223
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,680
can I trade with a one minute chart

1224
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,140
entirely all by itself yes

1225
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,819
but I'm not teaching you to do that

1226
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,020
because you're going to miss a lot of

1227
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,520
the information that I'm showing you

1228
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,920
here you would not have the context of

1229
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,480
using everything I'm talking about here

1230
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,220
without having the daily chart

1231
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,619
without having the weekly chart the draw

1232
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,780
on liquidity this blue line here 

1233
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:29,099
so when I'm looking at Price whether I have it on the chart or if it's on my notepad
because I'm using a notepad unless I draw it out on the chart for you 
because you're going to watch the video later on
there's no there's no annotations on my chart 
because I want my focus on where we are in that range 
so on my notepad I have the high the low and the MT price point of that Candlestick 

1244
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,460
right there on the daily chart and I have on

1245
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,540
my notepad daily propulsion block hi

1246
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,260
MT low so I'm watching price

1247
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,900
when it's Meandering around in here I'm

1248
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,700
watching time of day

1249
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,220
and how it responds at those specific

1250
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,560
levels because I'm predicting I'm

1251
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,900
anticipating I am not reacting to

1252
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,980
anything

1253
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,260
the only time that I react is if I'm

1254
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,880
wrong and I see the evidence in price

1255
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,880
action that I'm offside or and likely to

1256
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,500
become offside then I'm going to react

1257
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,060
to that new information and say okay I

1258
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,560
got a bail on the trade

1259
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,359
that's the only permission that you're

1260
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,220
ever going to get from me to react to

1261
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,560
price because everything else we are

1262
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,079
absolutely predicting price you are

1263
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,420
doing that you're predicting the future

1264
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,520
that's what this is It's future it's why

1265
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,440
they call it Futures Trading your lip is

1266
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,940
in the name and why are you arguing

1267
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,200
saying you're not trying to predict the

1268
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,099
price or you shouldn't be trying to

1269
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,020
predict the price you are if you are

1270
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,520
bullish that means you are predicting

1271
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,500
higher prices if you're bearish You're

1272
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,200
Expecting and predicting lower prices

1273
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,380
how are you reacting to anything

1274
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,819
if you're reacting it means you're

1275
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,339
chasing price I'm not chasing price I'm

1276
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,020
waiting for very specific things where

1277
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,880
price will walk into my crosshairs and

1278
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,500
when it does

1279
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,140
it's going down

1280
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,599
I'm going to pull the trigger and I'm

1281
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,819
getting my entry I have 81 ways to get

1282
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,339
in there trust me I'm getting in there

1283
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:56,220
if trading was like a a cat burglar I'd

1284
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,359
be the best one at it because I can get

1285
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,280
in that so we have the mean

1286
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,560
threshold here rallies back above

1287
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,660
REHs have been cleared

1288
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,760
here and now the bodies are showing that

1289
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,060
there is an interest in seeing no

1290
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,920
further decline

1291
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,319
or how do I know that because the bodies

1292
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,000
are not closing inside that blue shaded

1293
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,319
area it's already done the work of doing

1294
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,280
what

1295
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,700
trading down into MT

1296
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,380
one more time shifting higher so Market

1297
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,000
structure is now again one more time

1298
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,319
bullish

1299
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,300
so where's their inefficiency Above This

1300
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,619
price point right here when this candle

1301
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:29,520
closes

1302
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,079
this one right here

1303
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:34,020
when it closes where is the draw on

1304
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,280
liquidity

1305
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,140
from that price point there well you

1306
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,380
have this short term high so do you need

1307
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,660
do you need a depth of Market ladder to

1308
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,420
tell you or a or book map

1309
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,220
or some kind of order application to

1310
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,660
tell you there's going to be buy order

1311
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,640
stacking above this this High here do

1312
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,220
you need that because I don't you don't

1313
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,119
need that

1314
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,060
that's reading tape do you need to know

1315
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,280
that that all throughout this decline

1316
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,500
here while price starts going up you're

1317
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,819
going to see

1318
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,920
all the orders above the marketplace

1319
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,200
being eaten into because that's expected

1320
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,839
we expect that we anticipate that we're

1321
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,160
not reacting to that we're not surprised

1322
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,319
at saying wow look at how the depth of

1323
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,880
Market ladder is showing how all the

1324
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,619
orders keep getting eaten and consumed

1325
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:19,140
that that's expected that's reasonable

1326
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,940
we expect that we're not surprised by

1327
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,260
that

1328
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,000
we're not surprised to help we don't

1329
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,680
care what the number is either

1330
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,180
I don't care what the footprints sound

1331
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,400
how many people bought this level and

1332
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,380
versus that I don't care because my

1333
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,660
focus is on it's gonna

1334
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,339
roll right back up this inefficiency

1335
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,839
which is a sibi so I'll send a balanced

1336
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,160
by sound efficiency it's a

1337
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,859
classification of a fair value guy

1338
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,900
but then once it goes to this level here

1339
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,579
it's not done in my opinion because my

1340
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,040
focus is up here so I'm reading the tape

1341
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,339
I'm watching how it delivers

1342
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:51,900
all through here

1343
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,060
once you get to this price point here

1344
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,180
I'm going to anticipate I'm going to

1345
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,339
predict this is where I would be in my

1346
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,200
live stream this is where I would be 

1347
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:30,940
in my recording of my execution I'd be typing out "Big Range Candles Incoming"
when it gets right here right to that price point low
right there I would be typing out 
we're going to anticipate 
we're going to expect 
we're predicting 
we're not going to be surprised by large up close candles 
why? because it's going to make a quick run for the liquidity resting about this high
that's what the algorithm does folks. that's what it does 

1360
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,720
you're not going to know that from the depth of Market

1361
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,980
you're not going to know that from the

1362
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,260
footprint because that's it doesn't have

1363
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,060
the ability to show you that experience

1364
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,000
reading price action does so tape

1365
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,920
reading is where that skill set is

1366
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,560
derived from watching price action how

1367
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,480
it behaves

1368
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,059
I don't count the number of buys and

1369
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,500
sells at a specific price level to me

1370
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,839
it's irrelevant information I don't care

1371
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:58,079
that doesn't doesn't mean anything to me

1372
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,480
that's like saying how many cars passed

1373
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,520
me on the left lane going to my

1374
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,319
destination this morning I don't know

1375
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,720
I'm focused on a destination which is up

1376
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,680
here

1377
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,680
I don't care how many cars pass me as

1378
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,420
long as I have air in my tires gas in my

1379
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,000
tank and my engine running fine

1380
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,980
I'm getting there that's my focus I'm

1381
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,240
looking through the windshield I'm not

1382
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,920
looking in a rear view mirror which is

1383
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,440
what footprint does

1384
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,559
depth of Market it's so short-term in

1385
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,079
perspective you don't need that

1386
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,020
it's it's built in the idea that if you

1387
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,000
know that you're trying to be

1388
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,400
long on a Marketplace it goes without

1389
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,960
saying that the orders above the

1390
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,760
marketplace should be eaten and eroded

1391
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,319
into

1392
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,319
so where's the advantage in that

1393
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,359
it goes without saying it's part of it

1394
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,280
if the Market's going to go higher well

1395
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,359
there you go I don't care how many

1396
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,559
people are actually buying it because

1397
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:50,880
the volume

1398
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,980
how many buying and selling has

1399
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,599
absolutely no bearing on my belief

1400
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,280
system and why price goes where it goes

1401
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,220
because it's algorithmically delivered

1402
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,079
that's the problem

1403
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,540
that all of you have with me you're all

1404
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,099
wrong

1405
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,420
and you're wrestling you're arm

1406
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,160
wrestling they saying no no this is what

1407
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,900
it really is but you're not even coming

1408
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,819
close to the results I'm showing you you

1409
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,079
can't even come close to the same

1410
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,819
Precision that I'm showing you you can't

1411
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,260
even call the Market to the degree I'm

1412
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,119
doing on a weekly basis now

1413
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,200
at some point at some point

1414
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,420
you have to sit down

1415
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,220
lay down your pitchforks and your

1416
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,900
torches and say you know what

1417
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,180
let me just listen to this guy and see

1418
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,220
where it takes me that's all I'm asking

1419
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,180
you to do

1420
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,220
you don't have to do it

1421
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,960
but everything I'm telling you happens

1422
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,059
I'm telling you what goes on the

1423
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,099
marketplace and why it does

1424
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,920
I'm literally teaching it to you

1425
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,380
I'm not demonstrating toys I'm teaching

1426
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,940
you how to do it

1427
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,579
what you have to do to develop this

1428
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:56,400
skill set it takes work it's not

1429
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,800
watching a video it's understanding what

1430
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,480
you're supposed to do

1431
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,760
and then go out and do it yourself

1432
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,960
and it's going to feel like you don't

1433
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,680
know what you're doing in the beginning

1434
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,540
but showing up every day and from the

1435
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,700
charts reading the tape that means

1436
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,559
studying how it behaves without putting

1437
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,240
a demo trade on without putting a live

1438
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,500
trade on without trying to pass a

1439
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,420
combine on a funded account it means

1440
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,839
simply studying what price does based on

1441
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,780
the time of day and day of the week

1442
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,819
knowing in advance which I tell you

1443
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:25,559
where the Market's going to go

1444
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:26,880
it's going to go up or it's going to go

1445
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,040
down to a very specific level not range

1446
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,200
not Zone

1447
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,559
and you use that 30 years experience to

1448
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,359
trust while you're studying

1449
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,700
so we have an ICT bullish breaker here

1450
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,859
these are the instances where you see

1451
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,420
classic support resistance ideas come in

1452
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,980
and this right here this is one of those

1453
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,059
videos where someone's going to come

1454
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,160
back in the future and say see all ICT

1455
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,660
is doing he's showing you classic

1456
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,220
support and resistance and this is

1457
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,720
nothing new on Nissan

1458
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,079
no no

1459
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:00,000
trust me we're going to go deeper I want

1460
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,040
you to think about why this level would

1461
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,380
be sensitive anyway

1462
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,680
because there's other highs to the left

1463
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,180
of this and I talk about that on my

1464
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,819
market view that I did yesterday so on

1465
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:14,640
July 15 2023 there's a market commentary

1466
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,980
or market review video and I talk about

1467
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,599
that very instance

1468
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,040
so

1469
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,839
I'm not going to take it any further

1470
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,920
than that because I've already talked

1471
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,420
about it yesterday

1472
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,040
but I want you to think about how 
- the market from this high traded down 
- and then traded up 
- and then threw it
what does that make this range from this low to that high 
once we broke out Above This High here which is what we were anticipating 
we're not breakout Traders
we're not reacting to price 
we want to see that but what makes this a very specific range: this becomes a BPR 
what makes it balanced? we had a high we traded it down so sell side delivery has been offered not SSL

1488
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:29,440
SSD is any price run from a high to low 
we have had SSD from here in here that that range 
now when we run right back over that entire range again
from that low up to that high which is what we're doing here over time
as soon as we break through here this High to that low is now a BPR 

1498
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,680
there is absolutely no reason to anticipate expect or want to see price come back down below that low
why? because the focus is up here folks

1501
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:45,420
we're expecting we're predicting we're

1502
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,940
anticipating the market the footprint

1503
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,160
it's as radon up to that level

1504
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,319
we want to see that we're expecting that

1505
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,900
so where is the mile markers that going

1506
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,420
to be where's the where's the rest stops

1507
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,760
along away well when the market runs

1508
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,099
above this area here it's more likely to

1509
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,559
do what treat this level here as a

1510
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,660
breaker or a springboard to go higher

1511
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,520
why

1512
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,520
because this High has a lower

1513
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,980
low that's higher than this low over

1514
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,119
here I'm not showing it to you because I

1515
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,500
want you to look at the commentary from

1516
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,400
yesterday

1517
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,640
I talk about this on the hourly chart

1518
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,980
so the market comes back down 
does it Wick through that high 
absolutely and that's permissible 

1521
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,859
that means it's allowed we expect that we anticipate

1522
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,300
that we're not reacting we're not scared

1523
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,500
by it either

1524
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,540
look where the bodies close right here and it opens right there

1526
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,119
so there are Wicks that are going down

1527
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,339
into this bison and balance I'll sound

1528
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,200
efficiency which is busy it's a fair

1529
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,559
value guy but what specifically stands

1530
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,599
out here

1531
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,760
what is that

1532
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,640
what's the segment between this high

1533
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,400
on that Candlestick right there to this

1534
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,619
candlesticks home what is this area

1535
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,260
what is that

1536
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,599
it's inefficient but then when we see

1537
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,880
this Candlestick here trade down into it

1538
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,579
it erodes some of this inefficiency so

1539
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:30,599
it starts from here to here this becomes a breakaway Gap w
e don't want to see that we don't want to see that filled in
are you telling me the ICT is teaching
how the see anticipate and work with
Breakaway gaps yes
now did I say ICT invented Breakaway gaps no

1548
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:33,420
when I first started learning how to

1549
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,900
look at Price action and uh John

1550
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,140
Murphy's book which is the retail Bible

1551
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,240
for Traders everything in that book if

1552
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,920
you knew how to really trade based on

1553
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,880
what I'm teaching you could turn it

1554
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,700
upside down if you see that pattern

1555
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,619
that's taught in that book and my

1556
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:50,880
concepts are called for the opposite

1557
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,260
that pattern in that book is going to

1558
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,380
fail

1559
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,300
don't take my word for it

1560
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,000
and buy the book and challenge it so

1561
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
by the way I don't have any affiliation

1562
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,960
with John Murphy So when you buy his

1563
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,640
book I get new Kickback so there it is

1564
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,440
but it should be in every

1565
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,420
every Trader's library because it really

1566
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,339
is the retail Trader's Bible all that

1567
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:12,720
stuff in there

1568
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,839
is literally exploitable

1569
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,460
if you understand what price is really

1570
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,319
trying to do

1571
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:20,520
so we have

1572
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:24,119
this area here is a break wake up the

1573
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,859
reason why it becomes a breakaway Gap

1574
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,740
and why we would never expect

1575
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,260
the depth of Market the Dom even if

1576
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,880
there was bigger orders below the

1577
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,859
marketplace here okay if there was a

1578
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:36,540
stacking of orders below that that were

1579
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,480
really large okay big big interest to

1580
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,280
draw into that area down there they're

1581
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,319
not going to go down there those things

1582
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,760
are not going to fill

1583
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,599
what yeah yep no Footprints are going to

1584
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,700
be found down below that that low right

1585
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,480
there

1586
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,819
because it's going to go higher because

1587
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:55,980
this area is going to stay open
why should it stay open? because it's running out of this range

1591
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,839
right here it's already done the work of

1592
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,339
digging into

1593
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,859
this daily propulsion block this is why

1594
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:09,599
you cannot look at one Candlestick chart

1595
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,420
one time frame and follow the narrative

1596
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,579
you can't you can't be done folks either

1597
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:16,020
you're taking the information from the

1598
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,599
HTFs and transposing them

1599
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,940
that means placing whatever ideas that

1600
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,940
you think is supportive or

1601
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,160
counterproductive for your trade from a

1602
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,540
HTF whatever makes that

1603
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,099
trade idea you're under the

1604
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:34,680
I guess expectation is going to pan out

1605
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,839
whatever those ideas are from a higher

1606
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,940
time frame weekly and daily chart

1607
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,660
they have to be on your tradable chart

1608
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,280
either

1609
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,599
in

1610
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,359
some kind of annotation some kind of you

1611
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:51,180
know line or you know some kind of you

1612
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,680
know mechanism that draws your attention

1613
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,020
to it because if you don't have this

1614
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,059
information if I didn't have the

1615
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,280
propulsion block shaded over here you

1616
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,020
would not know what it is I'm talking

1617
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,940
about down here what makes the context

1618
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,980
behind why it would be trading the way

1619
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,740
it is you wouldn't know that that's the

1620
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,420
only reason why I put this lipstick on

1621
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,160
the charts because you're learning from

1622
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,319
me so I don't need this but because I

1623
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,000
don't need it doesn't mean I shouldn't

1624
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,900
put on the chart because if you're

1625
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,720
learning it will help you it's a crutch

1626
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,880
it helps you stay organized from one

1627
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,839
time frame to the next

1628
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,780
but my focus is up here

1629
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,880
I want this to go higher

1630
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,700
so I'm gonna watch price reading the

1631
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,280
tape and look for all the evidences all

1632
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,900
the signatures and price action that

1633
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,440
support that very thing coming to pass

1634
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,599
I want to see periods where it's going

1635
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:45,660
to run aggressively higher if I get that

1636
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,880
then I'm gonna be really trustworthy

1637
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,040
that I'm on side that means I'm on the

1638
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,780
right side of the marketplace and stay

1639
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,680
with the idea

1640
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,819
do we get that confirmation with the

1641
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,819
bodies thing at or above this high

1642
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:00,780
here

1643
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,200
yes does this stay open

1644
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,839
it's not trading back down into it so

1645
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:08,940
where's the advantage they are using

1646
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,640
depth of Market or ladders or footprint

1647
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,099
you would never expect this if you're my

1648
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,599
student you're never expecting this area

1649
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,240
to be printed into anymore

1650
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,180
but I promise you and I've seen it

1651
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,280
Traders are looking at those things and

1652
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,420
they're expecting to go down because

1653
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,160
they think this is an inefficiency now

1654
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,140
because ICC has talked about it

1655
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,660
no no this is why you should not be

1656
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,460
listening to Dollar Menu mentorships

1657
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,079
okay

1658
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,059
you're going through the ICT drive

1659
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,799
through just like they are

1660
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:39,599
okay you're having the same experience

1661
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,400
they are they're putting a price tag on

1662
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,540
something that they don't even know how

1663
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,579
to do yet

1664
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,660
learn how to do it independently you

1665
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,240
don't need to pay for this stuff

1666
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,819
so the market should be rallying higher

1667
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:52,859
where should It Go

1668
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:54,480
well where's the next draw on liquidity

1669
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,660
near term yes this is it up here but

1670
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,119
what Above This High exists in terms of

1671
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,520
liquidity buy sign

1672
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,740
so your book map

1673
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,680
or your depth of Market will start

1674
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,359
reflecting as we get closer to it

1675
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,579
there's going to be a lot of orders

1676
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:14,520
resting at or just above that high you

1677
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,900
need these tools to tell you that

1678
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,280
because I don't and my students don't

1679
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,559
need that either this is reading the

1680
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,380
tape this is what reading the tape is it

1681
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,380
has absolutely nothing to do with the

1682
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,700
things I opened this presentation up

1683
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,839
with

1684
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,119
so when you read or see or listen to

1685
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,380
these people out there they'll say

1686
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,640
you're talking about institutional order

1687
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,900
flow we're talking about reading the

1688
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,299
tape show me your order book no no no

1689
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:38,819
show me you using the information from

1690
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:40,980
those tools and you calling the market

1691
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,660
precisely

1692
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,119
because that is lacking I don't see that

1693
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,760
anywhere I absolutely do not see that I

1694
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,140
would love to see it I would be

1695
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,520
entertained by it and I would love

1696
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,140
watching the person whoever it may be

1697
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,480
that would be willing to do that

1698
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,319
I am a person that loves to study a

1699
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,720
traitor I don't want to relearn anything

1700
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,520
there's nothing else out there that

1701
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,900
would ever interest me that would ever

1702
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,339
be better than what might have what I

1703
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,500
have here is the market

1704
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,900
but I love watching how Traders navigate

1705
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,819
the marketplace themselves they manage

1706
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:13,920
themselves or mismanage themselves it's

1707
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,540
unfortunate sometimes but it's very

1708
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,980
entertaining also when they're

1709
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,799
discovering themselves

1710
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,960
and truth be told sometimes I try to

1711
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,460
counsel them and tell them where they

1712
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,079
should focus their attention on how to

1713
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:26,460
correct it and then many times it's not

1714
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,559
received in in good spirits I'm

1715
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,980
ridiculed or you know not

1716
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,440
given any regard for it but you know

1717
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,180
everybody has their own prerogatives in

1718
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,099
their own choices they don't have you

1719
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,000
don't have to you don't have to listen

1720
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,140
to me

1721
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,359
but I'm the guy calling all this stuff

1722
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:44,099
before it happens

1723
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,720
so the market right here has buy side

1724
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,420
the market draws up into it what happens

1725
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,940
before it gets to this run right here

1726
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,799
right here this run right there what

1727
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,040
happens

1728
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,059
you see this Wick right here

1729
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:02,400
you see that Wick half of that is what

1730
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,380
consequent encouragement interesting how

1731
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,780
it goes right down to it right there

1732
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,520
interesting how we have a gap right

1733
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,040
there with a wick

1734
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,839
so if we have a gap like this with a

1735
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:15,299
wick always trust

1736
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:18,119
and allow for it's likely to go into

1737
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:20,220
this CE not just

1738
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,559
filled in that Gap right there

1739
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,839
so it can trade down even though it goes

1740
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,780
over top that Gap the the candlestick's

1741
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,940
hybrid here if it went through that live

1742
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,640
I would not be unsettled by that

1743
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,579
I would not be scared by that

1744
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,460
I would look for this candlesticks Wick

1745
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,079
right here

1746
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,520
the midpoint which is consequent

1747
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,260
encroachment we treat that as a gap the

1748
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,540
Mark goes right back to it there

1749
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,520
then what does it do right back up here

1750
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,079
all right so when the next game opens up

1751
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:50,520
I would be looking at that and saying

1752
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,900
okay now I want to see it start

1753
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,780
expanding towards this High here

1754
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,200
and I want to see it

1755
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,160
aggressively run through I want to see

1756
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,420
speed

1757
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,980
oh we get it there

1758
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,319
we come back down in what is it doing

1759
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,200
it's working inside this Wick which is

1760
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,680
what a gap we do gradients on wicks

1761
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,339
75 of the wick 50 of the wick we never

1762
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:16,859
want to see in this case here lower than

1763
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,980
50 or CE so any

1764
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,200
respect of this Wick should be limited

1765
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,780
to the high 75 percent of the um Wick

1766
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,339
and then consequent equation which is

1767
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,380
half so in my mind when I'm watching

1768
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,940
price action over here I don't want to

1769
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,220
see it Go below half of that Wick

1770
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,559
find that in Steve Nielsen's book go

1771
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,480
over here look what it's doing

1772
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,819
it's going down but it won't breach on a

1773
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,579
closing basis midpoint of that Wick

1774
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,079
which is consequent encouragement that's

1775
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:45,720
tape reading you can't see that in Dom

1776
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,420
you can't see that in footprint you're

1777
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,559
not even going to look for it there's no

1778
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:50,700
reason for your look for it because it's

1779
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,280
not in that theory

1780
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,559
Dan's not talking about it white cup

1781
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,240
doesn't know anything about it either

1782
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,160
so the market does what it rallies Above

1783
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,140
This High here what's above that high

1784
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,220
buy side buy stops someone is chasing

1785
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,839
that lower when it's green this is an

1786
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,819
hourly chart so inside that week

1787
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:12,000
this in the hourly candlestick

1788
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,260
someone's going short where they're

1789
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,400
gonna place a stop

1790
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,559
about that high so the market does what

1791
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,020
it gravitates up to it here

1792
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,000
and we drop down

1793
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,280
respecting CE there

1794
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,660
and we rally

1795
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,000
what do we do now we start expanding

1796
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,680
aggressively towards that Weekly

1797
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,500
mitigation block

1798
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,359
this level right here

1799
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,280
and we trade up into

1800
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,180
that level there and then we consolidate

1801
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:45,440
markets do not top like this

1802
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,280
so we have what is this

1803
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,500
what is this area right here become once

1804
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,539
we trade through it here right there

1805
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:57,299
what does this area or fractal and price

1806
01:06:57,299 --> 01:06:58,619
action become

1807
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:00,900
the same thing I told you this becomes a

1808
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,520
balanced price range from this

1809
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,859
candlesticks High here

1810
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:07,740
up to this High then back down once we

1811
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,140
clear this High here this whole shaded

1812
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,599
area becomes a balanced price range I am

1813
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:13,859
not

1814
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,440
concerned about price one at any time up

1815
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,079
here going back down inside this range

1816
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,200
so for stop loss management your stop

1817
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,260
loss can be anywhere in this range and

1818
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,640
feel pretty confident that it's not

1819
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,900
going to get there so how would I do it

1820
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,819
and sleep good at night

1821
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,640
75 of that range if my stop is below

1822
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,839
that I'm comfortable with that

1823
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,460
some of you get crazy about how I'm

1824
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,500
using my stops sometimes they get really

1825
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,420
close to what you might be scared to do

1826
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,220
at the time when you're watching my

1827
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,500
executions and you're seeing it you're

1828
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,940
thinking man this is crazy I wouldn't

1829
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,380
feel comfortable because you just don't

1830
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,440
know I'm teaching you right now

1831
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,140
these are long videos these are very

1832
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,619
dense very

1833
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:00,660
demanding of your attention

1834
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,160
to learn

1835
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,440
and that's expected I didn't tell you

1836
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,880
it's going to be easy and watch a video

1837
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,200
and you know how to do it I've warned

1838
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,160
you ahead of time it's going to take a

1839
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,480
lot of work but it's something that it's

1840
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,220
worth doing because once you have this

1841
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,140
skill set nobody can take it from you

1842
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,240
they can make jokes about all they want

1843
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,620
but they're never going to be able to do

1844
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,560
what you can do once you master this

1845
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,060
so let's go into

1846
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,259
now we have the hourly chart over here

1847
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:26,819
and we have the balance price range

1848
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:27,600
there

1849
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,339
and now this chart here is a 15 minute

1850
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:30,960
time frame

1851
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,000
so we have the market

1852
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,699
trading sideways ahead of Friday

1853
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,140
so we have this consolidation here and

1854
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,939
then we have a market report that's due

1855
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:43,738
out

1856
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:45,660
on Friday

1857
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,540
we're anticipating what the Market's not

1858
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,279
going to top like this

1859
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:52,140
so we anticipate the Market's going to

1860
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,399
do what

1861
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:57,060
spool higher going higher run higher

1862
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,939
so at 8 30 when the news comes out on

1863
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:03,000
Friday here's the five minute chart here

1864
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,238
we have the market rally aggressively

1865
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:07,738
here which is a buy side and balanced

1866
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:09,839
sales sign efficiency which is the long

1867
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,560
name for bissy b-i-s-i this is a fair

1868
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,560
value Gap by classification specifically

1869
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,299
buy side imbalance cell side

1870
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,160
inefficiency that means it's

1871
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,100
buy side imbalance it's more upside and

1872
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,899
it didn't go back and forth

1873
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,779
to offer sell side delivery we get

1874
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,880
partial sell side delivery with this

1875
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,219
drop right here in this segment in price

1876
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:34,500
action where I told you it's a breakaway

1877
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,939
Gap that's what I'm zoomed into here

1878
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,979
showing on a five minute basis but I

1879
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,500
want you to think about what

1880
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,859
is occurring here at this time of day at

1881
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:46,439
10 30 after the news driver

1882
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:49,920
we have this swing low here and it

1883
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,198
breaks below that

1884
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:54,480
this segment of price action right in

1885
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,860
here

1886
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,160
is a fair value guy it's a sibby sell

1887
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,840
side imbalance by side and efficiency

1888
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,219
which is the opposite of this over here

1889
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:05,760
so it's offering the market on a sell

1890
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,980
side delivery but there is an

1891
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,440
inefficiency on buy side so we would

1892
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,500
anticipate markets like this to re-price

1893
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,600
up into this Candlestick or higher

1894
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,820
and then reprice lower why what time of

1895
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,340
day is it New York lunch macro so Above

1896
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,760
This High we have buy side liquidity and

1897
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,100
it's entering a time of day where the

1898
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,719
lunch macro which is going to do what

1899
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,360
it's going to run for liquidity where is

1900
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,760
the liquidity at for this time of day

1901
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,400
looking at in this area here it's below

1902
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,960
the lows of the morning

1903
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,400
what is that

1904
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,000
right here

1905
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,320
this is your your swing low right after

1906
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,260
the news driver hits the marketplace

1907
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,179
first swing low here

1908
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,640
everybody that went long or was long

1909
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,159
before this market report was out they

1910
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,020
have their cell stop resting right below

1911
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,659
that that's exactly what the lunch macro

1912
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,520
will do it'll run from this fairbag app

1913
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,600
here

1914
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,420
drop down aggressively

1915
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,580
leaving what

1916
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,400
most of this portion of this open which

1917
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,780
is what I've already talked about in the

1918
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,820
couple minutes ago this is a breakaway

1919
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,600
guy

1920
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,300
this line right here

1921
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,340
is this line right there it's the

1922
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,400
breaker so this high that line is this

1923
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,860
line right here on the five minute chart

1924
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,480
this little segment of price action

1925
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,860
right there and it's a breakaway Gap

1926
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,260
that's this little portion right here

1927
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,600
below that low

1928
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,340
okay so that way you can

1929
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,380
find your way through the charts of what

1930
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,120
I'm showing you if you're not doing this

1931
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,580
with your own analysis and toggling

1932
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,780
through

1933
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,280
you know scrolling through each

1934
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,840
individual time frame while you're

1935
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,179
watching price action having every

1936
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,739
expectation the Market's going to be

1937
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,659
going what going higher

1938
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,460
so we're seeing even on the five minute

1939
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,620
chart look at the bodies of these

1940
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:59,580
candles here are they closing below

1941
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,800
that breaker line which is this

1942
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,780
candlesticks high right there

1943
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,820
even on the five minute chart it's

1944
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,920
showing you what that this is being

1945
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,380
respected there's no necessity for it to

1946
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,300
trade back down into this area so that

1947
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,239
will be a what a breakaway Gap

1948
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:16,739
that indicates that we're going to see

1949
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,080
continuous upside delivery

1950
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,239
and it's going to draw towards the buy

1951
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,040
side that's the next significant pool of

1952
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,000
liquidity

1953
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,739
so throughout the afternoon we see the

1954
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:27,719
market treated higher

1955
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,179
come back down in

1956
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,760
trade higher

1957
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,640
come back down in some random fair value

1958
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,760
Gap here and then gravitate start moving

1959
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,560
towards the higher high again which is

1960
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,620
this here okay we run out of day

1961
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,199
during the day session so all this

1962
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,060
consolidation when we resume at 6 PM

1963
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,980
because the market takes a an hour break

1964
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,580
between 5 PM Eastern Time to 6 p.m when

1965
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,620
that occurs when markets start trading

1966
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,100
again the same premise we would have in

1967
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,500
our expectation we're not reacting we're

1968
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,880
anticipating and predicting price that

1969
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,199
will eventually gravitate towards this

1970
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,940
High here so if you're an overnight

1971
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,260
session Trader say you want to trade in

1972
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,020
Asia say you want to trade in London

1973
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,760
you're using these ideas in conjunction

1974
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,920
with the day and time that you're

1975
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,840
trading so where's liquidity the

1976
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,640
liquidity is not changing because you're

1977
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,980
trading in Asia the liquidity is not

1978
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,840
hiding itself and becoming something

1979
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,219
different and morphing into something

1980
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:24,900
else because you're in the London

1981
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,360
session liquidity is there and it's

1982
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,400
going to gravitate towards that level

1983
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,060
and if this context is here we focus on

1984
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,560
moving higher

1985
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,780
so let's go a little bit further in this

1986
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,880
here's that five minute chart

1987
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,520
you can see how we gravitated here

1988
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,719
higher and now

1989
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,060
the end of the day and now starting a

1990
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,159
new day

1991
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:50,400
so we start working towards what all

1992
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,560
throughout Asia and then we get to

1993
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,380
midnight interesting enough going into a

1994
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:59,159
new day at midnight New York time we ran

1995
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:04,159
the buy side here right there boom

1996
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,960
then we do what we come back down

1997
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,120
what's below here

1998
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,000
South Side stops

1999
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,620
but I want to take you before we go any

2000
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,820
further here I want to take you back

2001
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,800
into this area here focus on this little

2002
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,900
segment of price action right there what

2003
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,820
time frame is this chart

2004
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,380
are you looking up here

2005
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,400
it's a five minute chart

2006
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:27,719
look at all the things here on this five

2007
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:29,159
minute chart do you see anything that

2008
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:31,739
stands out we'll come back to it but I

2009
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:33,860
want you to see in comparing contrast

2010
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,540
the price action on the five minute

2011
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,159
we're gonna drop down to a four three

2012
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,380
two and one but we're going to focus on

2013
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,699
this little area and why am I focusing

2014
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:44,159
on this area here to shade it in

2015
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,920
from this high down to that low and then

2016
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,420
how we start to deliver going back up

2017
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,360
because the the trust is that there's no

2018
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,980
necessity to go back down into this area

2019
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,600
which is a breakaway Gap because this

2020
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,920
line here

2021
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,560
is your bullish breaker everything is

2022
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,199
indicating that order flow is supporting

2023
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,699
that idea

2024
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:04,620
I don't need a ladder I don't need a

2025
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,420
depth of Market I don't need a footprint

2026
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,760
I don't need any of that stuff you don't

2027
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,340
either the time based chart will tell

2028
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,679
you everything you need

2029
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,320
it's simple it really is simple but

2030
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,640
you're trying to bring every concept

2031
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,260
that I've ever introduced into every

2032
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,400
discussion

2033
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,560
I'm not doing that

2034
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,300
I'm not bringing everything into this

2035
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,520
fractal here only things that stand out

2036
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,440
in this fractal I can only deal with

2037
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,659
whatever PD arrays exist in this shaded

2038
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:31,620
area

2039
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,360
so watch this shaded area this is the

2040
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,440
five minute chart now we're going to

2041
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,400
transition into a four minute

2042
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,500
okay notice any changes here this is the

2043
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,400
part of the video you're going to want

2044
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,340
to go back and study independently or

2045
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,980
look at it from your own chart

2046
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,020
preferably I don't know what time you're

2047
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,159
going to watch this video maybe years

2048
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,440
later but I'm doing this for the purpose

2049
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,420
of that because you may not be able to

2050
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,520
recall this information on your chart at

2051
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,500
the time so yeah you can use my charts

2052
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,540
here and screenshot them and

2053
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,000
do whatever annotations you want to do

2054
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,239
now we'll look at the three minute chart

2055
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,239
okay that is all this here what is price

2056
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:10,860
dealing I don't need a depth of Market

2057
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,239
to show you what I'm about to show you

2058
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,159
it's a two minute chart

2059
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,320
same range but it looks different

2060
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,860
doesn't it

2061
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,360
and then finally down to the one minute

2062
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,260
chart

2063
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,179
now this

2064
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:30,120
green line here again is the hourly

2065
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,120
bullish breaker that high

2066
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,940
we dig into it here one

2067
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:39,840
one two three times and then we have a

2068
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,560
swing High

2069
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,239
broken to the upside

2070
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:48,060
the last down closed candle prior to

2071
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,940
that shift in Market structure that down

2072
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,699
close candle is a bullish order block

2073
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:57,360
that opening price is a change in the

2074
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,659
state of delivery now huge leap forward

2075
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:01,980
for people that want to learn order

2076
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,040
blocks okay

2077
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,120
for the record

2078
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,699
order blocks have zero notice I'm not

2079
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:09,840
talking about that the market here

2080
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,600
notice I'm not even pointing at a ladder

2081
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,460
I'm not talking about footprint I didn't

2082
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,199
even talk about volume I don't care how

2083
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,739
many orders were purchased or sold short

2084
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:22,199
in this candle it's irrelevant

2085
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:24,000
that has nothing to do with my order

2086
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,580
block my order block which is codified

2087
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,260
and created and authored by me nobody

2088
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,000
else is the author of it I didn't borrow

2089
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,860
it from somebody else and any supply and

2090
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,080
demand

2091
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,020
this candle right here the open of that

2092
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,239
candle the change in the state of

2093
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,760
delivery is when that candle sticks

2094
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,820
opening price is crossed right there for

2095
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,440
the first time

2096
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,940
when that happens then and only then

2097
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,120
never before never another time in the

2098
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,940
future that validates this down closed

2099
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:00,060
candle as a bullish order block

2100
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,100
now why

2101
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,739
what makes that an order block the fact

2102
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:07,920
that we have this bullish

2103
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,080
hourly breaker

2104
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,420
the fact that we traded down into it and

2105
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,540
then we see a shift in Market structure

2106
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,640
then we go back to the down closed

2107
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,460
candle the last one prior to a run

2108
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,040
higher that has a shift in Market

2109
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,980
structure there that is not a change of

2110
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:28,260
character

2111
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,840
rebranding

2112
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,719
stop it this is not an Fu candle this is

2113
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:35,460
not an engulfing King I don't care if

2114
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,320
this candle started here

2115
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,020
it opened here and went down or if it

2116
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,060
opened here and went down I would draw

2117
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,040
it right on the opening price

2118
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,440
it has nothing to do with engulfing it

2119
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,300
has nothing to do with anything else

2120
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,500
except for what I'm teaching you right

2121
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,600
here folks anybody out there trying to

2122
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,739
teach order blocks unless they're

2123
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:54,659
parenting exactly what I said in another

2124
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,760
video lecture they don't know what

2125
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,199
they're talking about

2126
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:01,140
period and the story that's just the

2127
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,780
facts

2128
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,120
this becomes a bullish order block as

2129
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,460
soon as that candle crosses it

2130
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:11,219
what the opening price that's the change

2131
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:12,540
in the state of delivery soon as that

2132
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,300
occurs this low

2133
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,060
should not be violated

2134
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,719
so you can now start looking for bullish

2135
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:24,540
PD arrays that are in discount well

2136
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,800
everything's in a discount now because

2137
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
we're so far down but

2138
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,100
we have a down close candle right here

2139
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,800
so we can use that opening price extend

2140
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,560
it for anything in there buying this

2141
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,420
anywhere in this area here buying buying

2142
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,520
that you can buy that with a stop loss

2143
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,500
right below there

2144
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,360
well that's a little bit too wide for me

2145
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,120
then don't take the tree

2146
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,940
wait for another run higher and look for

2147
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,100
an inefficiency wait for a fair value go

2148
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,580
wait for a breaker wait for a

2149
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,500
institutional order for entry drill wait

2150
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,540
for whatever your model is suggesting

2151
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,699
you should use

2152
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,640
but look closer

2153
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,820
we are now looking at that price range

2154
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,400
from this high up here all the way down

2155
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,820
to that low we trusted that low will not

2156
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,760
be violated why because this Candlestick

2157
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,679
was crossed right there now what happens

2158
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,780
let's pay Depot's Advocate what happens

2159
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,760
if it breaks that low okay then you have

2160
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,100
this continuously study price action and

2161
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,440
wait for that same instances where we

2162
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,760
see a shift in our construction to it

2163
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,739
upside in the last down closed candle

2164
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,420
we'll mark the opening price and if

2165
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,520
there's a candle that goes above it that

2166
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,260
validates the down close candle as a

2167
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,400
bullish order block

2168
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,040
this is only one form of my bullish over

2169
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,159
block there are so many of them and yes

2170
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,420
for the folks out there that have a

2171
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,800
problem with me having all kinds of

2172
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,140
weapons in my repertoire I'm sorry that

2173
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,360
I'm not a one-trick pony I'm sorry that

2174
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,380
there's a whole lot of things out there

2175
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,880
but you don't have to know everything

2176
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,580
I'm teaching you you just need one thing

2177
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,860
one thing one concept one model and you

2178
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,060
can be profitable and you don't have to

2179
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,440
worry about anything else I've ever made

2180
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,760
videos about I don't know why you guys

2181
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,260
are complicated you're complicating it

2182
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,580
not me you are so

2183
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,159
we have the ranges here 75 of the range

2184
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,620
is the gradient 50 percent

2185
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,480
and then 25 percent

2186
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,239
so I want you to notice how as price

2187
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,540
works very close to 25 of that range

2188
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,940
again the range is the high to that low

2189
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,800
we are trusting that it wants to go

2190
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,060
higher now because we have a change in a

2191
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,500
state of delivery and when that candle

2192
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,719
starts moving above that opening price

2193
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,580
now we have it it's in place

2194
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,159
we have a shift in Market structure all

2195
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:37,560
lights are green for going higher how do

2196
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,540
we use this information how do we read

2197
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,000
the tape how do we discount the

2198
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,739
necessity for reaching for depth of

2199
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:46,560
Market ladders and footprints

2200
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,739
you'll need those tools 

2201
01:21:49,739 --> 01:22:03,659
look at price. 
order flow 
what kind of order flow?
institutional order flow 
easiest, right to the chase no bones about it
easiest thing is if we're bullish we want to see down closed candles support price

2207
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:16,040
if we see a short-term low taken out, we expect to see that as a stop run and then price should revert right back into going higher right away 
and everything I just said reverse it for when the markets are bearish

2213
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,580
it's that simple folks watch we have a

2214
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,679
down closed candle here draw it out in

2215
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:25,320
time does price support at that level

2216
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,980
yes yes yes does it start moving higher

2217
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,860
yes does it take out short-term highs

2218
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,239
yes

2219
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,980
yes

2220
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,520
down close candle is price supporting it

2221
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,500
as a bullish order block yes it's not

2222
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,540
going below it does price go higher and

2223
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,480
take out High yes it does we have a down

2224
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,640
closed candle does price go down into it

2225
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,920
and reject that area and leave it and

2226
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,060
break a high

2227
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:53,460
yes do you need a depth of Market ladder

2228
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:56,100
to tell you that we expect the depth of

2229
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,260
Market the latter to start eating into

2230
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,940
those orders above the market price

2231
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,760
that's expected folks we anticipate that

2232
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,280
we are predicting that to happen

2233
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,280
we expect that your candlesticks and

2234
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,860
your raincoat bars and your algo bars

2235
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,120
and whatever the hell you're going to be

2236
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,199
using

2237
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,580
they're going to start going higher

2238
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:19,500
that's expected folks

2239
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,060
we expect that

2240
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,340
we're not surprised by it down close

2241
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,960
candles here why am I picking this one

2242
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,280
because it's above this High here and

2243
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,460
it's high here so does it support price

2244
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,440
look at it what happens when it hits it

2245
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,840
starts going higher does it take out a

2246
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,239
short-term High yes it does so is order

2247
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,360
flow bullish or bearish if

2248
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,520
what is it reaching for

2249
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,699
a premium relative to what the range

2250
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:48,020
which is this High to that low

2251
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,820
that is determined by this level here

2252
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,860
which is equilibrium

2253
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,960
at that level or below it is what

2254
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,820
discount

2255
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:21,540
at that level or above is what premium, so when we get above this 50 level
it's far less probability, more risk if we start taking order blocks and buying them Above This level
because we're in the premium range of this high to low

2265
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:24,420
doesn't mean it can't keep rallying it

2266
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,880
just means that we have to do all of our

2267
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,659
buying below equilibrium or less while

2268
01:24:30,659 --> 01:24:32,880
we're on a discount that's the framework

2269
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,900
for high probability

2270
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,100
short-term lows being taken out we

2271
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,960
expect that to be rejected and start

2272
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,880
seeing price go higher we start to see

2273
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,800
it run higher here because it finds

2274
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,120
support on this down closed candle here

2275
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,580
yes sends it higher does it take a short

2276
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,679
term High yes and yes

2277
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,239
we have a down closed candle here right

2278
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:53,159
around equilibrium

2279
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:55,260
no return back to here that's fine

2280
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,699
because that we're in an area where it's

2281
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:57,960
a short-term premium

2282
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,880
down closed candle here

2283
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,739
look at the body supporting that idea

2284
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,380
and then the Rally's higher Highs are

2285
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,600
taken out down closed candle does it

2286
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,020
support it as bullish yes higher

2287
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:36,120
so when I'm watching price and I'm on one side and I'm expecting prices to go higher 
I'm looking at every down closed candle as a means or mechanism to support price 
or any swing low is a potential stop run so I'm not in a hurry 
if I'm long to ram my stop loss between some random swing low 
because that's exactly what the algorithm is going to do, it's going to sweep below them 

2298
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,420
like it does here like it does here and like it does here

2299
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,000
and then once it does that a round

2300
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,800
equilibrium then it's going to go into

2301
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,840
another price leg higher and then we

2302
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,600
enter a consolidation

2303
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,060
what's below here cell stops

2304
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,199
now we can go higher

2305
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,540
notice also that we have all of these

2306
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,360
FVGs right here and all this

2307
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,620
in here

2308
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,900
when we have a change in the state of

2309
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,340
delivery and we enter a buy program

2310
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,679
which is where we are from this point on

2311
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,179
there

2312
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,580
well what's going on here Michael it's

2313
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,440
just retracing that's all it's doing

2314
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,320
it's allowing for a Deeper Discount with

2315
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,480
that low staying intact

2316
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,880
when this high is taken out here notice

2317
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,260
that we have another return back into

2318
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,880
this order block when we have this

2319
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,139
retracement back in the over block here

2320
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,460
that's when we start seeing the more

2321
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:28,860
pronounced run higher but look what's

2322
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,139
occurring here all of this imbalance

2323
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:32,520
here

2324
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,520
what is it lacking buy side delivery not

2325
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,219
liquidity buy side deliveries when there

2326
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:40,679
is a run higher in Price look what it's

2327
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:42,600
doing it runs higher look at the bodies

2328
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,060
respecting what the inefficiency is high

2329
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:48,179
right there this city that candle is low

2330
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:51,600
wasn't respecting this candle's low

2331
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,960
here now what is it dropping down into

2332
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,000
CE midpoint of this

2333
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,880
candle's low and this candle is high

2334
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,820
there rallies where's rally two the fair

2335
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,500
Bay Gap right here

2336
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,239
so what how we use this information

2337
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,239
their inversion FVGs

2338
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:11,760
these are like a mountain climber

2339
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,380
and the mountain climber is climbing up

2340
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,060
the surface of the mountain and he's

2341
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,320
looking for those little pockets that

2342
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,120
stick his fingers into and stick his

2343
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,900
toes on to find footing and grasp a new

2344
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,060
finger point or holding point to pull

2345
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,520
his body up well we're in a bullish

2346
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,659
market now

2347
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,400
we're in a buy program we're climbing a

2348
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,139
mountain what's the mountain this is the

2349
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:33,960
Mountainside here this is the most sheer

2350
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,000
drop-off

2351
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,820
so this is the smoothest part

2352
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,880
in that drop-off so we have to use these

2353
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,179
areas to find what footing

2354
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:46,739
there's little pockets we have to wait

2355
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:48,540
for them to form that means consequent

2356
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,620
encroachment

2357
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,020
short term low trades below what's it

2358
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,639
going to do trade back into this order

2359
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:55,320
block and take out that short-term low

2360
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,540
for sell stops I'm not freaking out when

2361
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,280
I see that I want to see it react at

2362
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,719
that order block and then also that it's

2363
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,580
taken out liquidity and there's also a

2364
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,080
volume and balance right there

2365
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,960
that's tape reading you watch price

2366
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,940
whether you're watching it live or you

2367
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,260
have to watch it in Market replay which

2368
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,659
is not going to be the same folks unless

2369
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:14,880
unless you can watch price delivery

2370
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,760
every individual fluctuation which

2371
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,860
trading view is limited it doesn't do

2372
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,300
that

2373
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,520
um it's better for you if you can't

2374
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,920
watch live price action to to Res you

2375
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,440
know record your screens I use Camtasia

2376
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,159
which is a application from

2377
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:34,159
techsmith.com

2378
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,239
t-e-c-h-s-m-i-t-h Dot c-o-m

2379
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:41,699
and that is the

2380
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:43,199
the program that I use to record and

2381
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,179
make these videos you can set it to

2382
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:47,280
record the marketplace while you're at

2383
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,659
work while you're sleeping while you're

2384
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,820
at school whatever and then when you

2385
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,560
come home you can play back the

2386
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,420
recording and watch real-time price

2387
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:57,060
delivery and it's a wonderful way to do

2388
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,400
journaling if I had that resource when I

2389
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,840
first started that's how I would do my

2390
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,940
journaling I would make it in video

2391
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,980
format and yes it takes a lot of time

2392
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,719
yes it would take a lot of time to

2393
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,540
manage it all yes but all that time

2394
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,239
would shorten anyone's learning curve

2395
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,560
but you don't want to put a lot of work

2396
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,699
into it and you wonder why you're not

2397
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,920
getting the results you're looking for

2398
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,679
so FVGs like this if we're

2399
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,120
bearish we expected to go up there and

2400
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,440
sell off but when there's a change in

2401
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,300
the state of delivery

2402
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,420
we expect the market to go up so all

2403
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,340
these down movements here it's lacking

2404
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,500
what by side delivery so it's going to

2405
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,360
want to gravitate up into them

2406
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,179
if it ever retraces into them once it

2407
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:37,679
closes them in

2408
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,260
we treat them as what inversion fair

2409
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:41,639
value gaps

2410
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,620
so we see this CE

2411
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,600
which is midpoint of the Shaded area

2412
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,060
midpoint between this low and this high

2413
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,960
here we rally up to what

2414
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,639
this Gap we're treating it as an

2415
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:54,960
inversion paper you get does that mean

2416
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,699
it's going to trade right here and go

2417
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:57,960
higher rate from there no we have to

2418
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,820
wait and watch what is this here this is

2419
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,260
a buy-time balance outside efficiency

2420
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:04,620
what is this right here it's a swing low

2421
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,780
we've had a nice move outside of the

2422
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,820
range of these REHs and

2423
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,300
we're into two inefficiencies this one

2424
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,280
and this one and now we have a short

2425
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,719
term low it's

2426
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:18,719
probable not guaranteed it's probable

2427
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,880
that it's going to run for short-term

2428
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,520
sell-side liquidity stop hunt that's

2429
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,380
what we're getting from here it drops

2430
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,300
down takes out that liquidity also

2431
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,159
respecting constant encroachment of this

2432
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:31,560
Fairway Gap

2433
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,699
then rallies it rallies to this high and

2434
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:37,739
through this inversion FVG

2435
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:39,600
comes back down

2436
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,600
support support rallies back up what is

2437
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,860
it creating

2438
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,560
what's it creating here

2439
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,540
short term low so what's going to be

2440
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:51,380
trailed up right behind that sell side

2441
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:55,380
where are we at in the range

2442
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,820
from high

2443
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,380
to low

2444
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,239
here's equilibrium we're right there at

2445
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,840
equilibrium when this occurs equilibrium

2446
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,639
is where you're going to anticipate

2447
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:07,260
you're going to predict you're going to

2448
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:08,699
expect

2449
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:10,800
a stop hunt

2450
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,540
that's what the algorithm will do don't

2451
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,639
take my word for this folks do not take

2452
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,260
my word for it you go back and look at

2453
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,940
old price moves you're going to see this

2454
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:21,659
every single time 100 of the time every

2455
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:23,219
single time and that's what you're

2456
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:25,920
seeing here a run on stops this one is

2457
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,840
two times

2458
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,179
but returning back into what this fair

2459
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:31,679
value gap which is an inversion for

2460
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,719
everybody got you would take this extend

2461
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:34,800
it over

2462
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,739
what is it respecting

2463
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:39,540
this order block still that's a

2464
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,980
reclaimed order block but it's also in

2465
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:44,159
concert with this candlesticks low

2466
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,280
it's respecting that old Gap so that

2467
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,500
makes this an entry off of what this

2468
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,139
inversion fair value got right here

2469
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:55,080
the market finds support here

2470
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,699
rallies

2471
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:59,159
takes up high takes up the high And

2472
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,620
Trades up into what

2473
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,199
the next Gap over here which will be

2474
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,540
treated as what an inversion of airbago

2475
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,920
so I'm looking at like a mountain

2476
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,360
climber here

2477
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,280
I'm looking at all the potential finger

2478
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,440
holes where I can grab a hold too pull

2479
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,000
myself up higher that's what price is

2480
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,760
doing that's all prices doing folks it's

2481
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,679
so easy to understand when you try to

2482
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,900
lay down all the other stuff you're

2483
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,340
trying to bring into this you want to

2484
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,300
bring in

2485
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,219
Elliott wave stuff still you want to

2486
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:27,900
bring in harmonic animal patterns that

2487
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,179
have absolutely no reason for expecting

2488
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:31,679
price to go higher or lower that's a

2489
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,900
fantasy that's a religion

2490
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,120
don't bring Gan into discussion white

2491
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,139
golf

2492
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:40,260
it's let the man rest okay he's not part

2493
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,300
of this conversation I promise you he's

2494
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,500
not

2495
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,420
when we drop down we're taking out

2496
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:48,239
Southside here

2497
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,659
and we're doing what for rallying off of

2498
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:54,420
the low of this okay Vega

2499
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:56,580
so this candle sticks High that's what

2500
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,780
we're respecting everything look at the

2501
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,520
bodies it's telling you the story it's

2502
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,679
supporting the idea that that is still

2503
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,659
the underlying narrative

2504
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:06,120
thoughts have been taken

2505
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,679
control mechanisms are in place the

2506
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,480
algorithm is absolutely respecting that

2507
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,120
old fair value gut right here that again

2508
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,880
Samsung we are cutting through candles

2509
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,560
because that's where the narrative is

2510
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,020
derived from

2511
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,340
the inversion pair that you got for the

2512
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:23,400
win rallies order block touch it does it

2513
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,139
rally higher yes does it stay at a high

2514
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:27,620
yep

2515
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,620
do you see what tape reading is now

2516
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,780
do you understand how we're working with

2517
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,820
time frames and we drop down to the

2518
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:38,100
lower time frames and we do not need any

2519
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,080
gimmicks to see what price should do

2520
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,840
it's liquidity and inefficiency it's

2521
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,260
discount and premium time of day all

2522
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,699
these things come together to make a

2523
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:49,500
beautiful tapestry and you're never

2524
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,120
surprised

2525
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,500
once you understand all this stuff

2526
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,480
you're not surprised you want to see

2527
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,040
these things form and you're waiting for

2528
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,120
them to form

2529
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,280
my profitable students see these things

2530
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,199
before they happen

2531
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,520
the only thing that happens when they're

2532
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,500
watching price they're not saying oh my

2533
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,239
goodness where did that come from why

2534
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,400
did that just happen they're grinning

2535
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,380
before it starts to deliver they know

2536
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:12,600
it's coming

2537
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,580
they are grinning right now as they're

2538
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:15,540
listening to it because they know

2539
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,420
nodding their head yup yup because if

2540
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,920
we're all on the same river now and I

2541
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,820
said raise your hand if you've been

2542
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,500
there before all kinds of hands will be

2543
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,860
raised up

2544
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,300
but you can't experience it until you

2545
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,920
had that experience

2546
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,420
and you'll never have that experience

2547
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,920
until you go in and watch and study

2548
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,020
price action like this

2549
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,760
I promise you all the things I'm

2550
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,920
teaching you they keep repeating

2551
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,600
but you want something that's easy go

2552
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,980
out there in one two three get me and

2553
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,600
get me out never have a losing trade and

2554
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,739
I'm sorry

2555
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:46,620
but there's no way to do that

2556
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:49,139
I get it wrong sometimes

2557
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:51,800
sometimes

2558
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,780
all right so here is the back on the 15

2559
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,280
minute time frame so what happens once

2560
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,020
we clear this balance price range here

2561
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,940
remember we hit the bullish breaker line

2562
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,020
here

2563
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,880
we have all these inefficiencies in here

2564
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,860
what happens when we get above it what

2565
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,300
can we do now well we have a Target up

2566
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,679
here that's a drawing liquidity and then

2567
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,360
we have now this Old Market structure

2568
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,280
high so now we can take that range and

2569
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,260
draw a fib from that high up

2570
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,139
to this target now we have gradients so

2571
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:18,120
now we're grading a future price point

2572
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,340
that has not happened yet

2573
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,139
as soon as this Candlestick right here

2574
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:26,040
closes now we run from high to Target

2575
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,920
and we run gradients and now watch what

2576
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,980
happens around the 20 I'm sorry I have

2577
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:34,739
it backwards here 75 or the lower 25 of

2578
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:36,659
the range between the draw and liquidity

2579
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:39,239
and the high that was broken we don't

2580
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:40,320
think that the Market's going to go down

2581
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,639
here why because this is a balanced

2582
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:42,780
price range

2583
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,880
so we anticipate every instrument out

2584
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:45,960
there every little gimmick every little

2585
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,080
toy is going to say oh look orders are

2586
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,780
getting eaten above market price

2587
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,400
the footprints showing that look it's

2588
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,960
it's bull it's just absolutely bullish

2589
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,540
of course it is it's gone higher

2590
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,580
so we have relative equal lows and they

2591
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,199
sweep that where does that occur in the

2592
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,060
lower quadrant of the range from this

2593
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,920
high up to that Throne liquidity which

2594
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,620
is the weekly mitigation block that's

2595
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,320
what this level is up here

2596
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,239
then we have consolidation where does

2597
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,340
consolidation form ICT although I said

2598
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,020
it in the core content lessons back in

2599
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,000
2016 and I taught it to everybody that

2600
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,800
was my private one-on-one student back

2601
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,719
in 1996.

2602
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,600
at equilibrium 50 level right here

2603
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,500
that's where consolidation is forming

2604
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:30,179
and then what happens

2605
01:36:30,179 --> 01:36:32,219
a stop hunt

2606
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:34,080
lower time frames look in there you'll

2607
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,159
see it

2608
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:36,719
rallies up

2609
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,760
another time here and what happens here

2610
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,580
at the upper quadrant

2611
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:43,260
from the draw in liquidity

2612
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:44,520
to this high

2613
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:47,699
we're anticipating new price points that

2614
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:49,620
surge higher that's what that's what I'm

2615
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,360
showing you here

2616
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,860
we rally up then we take out the

2617
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:56,280
liquidity above

2618
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,940
that Weekly mitigation block

2619
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,980
then we do what we find some support at

2620
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,880
it

2621
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,500
and then we consolidate going into

2622
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,060
Friday

2623
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,960
New York session

2624
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,520
that's where we're at now this is a

2625
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,460
15-minute time frame on Friday

2626
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:16,380
and we're consolidating

2627
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,300
markets do not top like this folks

2628
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,760
especially ahead of

2629
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,679
news drivers

2630
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:25,560
so a market report

2631
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,840
we're expecting prices go higher

2632
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,699
we've Consolidated we're part of a

2633
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:32,280
bullish run and we're expecting

2634
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,960
capitulation to come in and that's what

2635
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,760
we're seeing here Market rallies

2636
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,860
aggressively

2637
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:40,080
what are we what are we seeing here see

2638
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,560
this Gap right there

2639
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,120
extend that through that's what you're

2640
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,320
seeing that's an inversion fair value

2641
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,639
explosive run to the upside

2642
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,780
retracement

2643
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,900
failed to run higher

2644
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:01,679
back down into the cell side here for a

2645
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,780
TGIF tree

2646
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:06,360
let's take a closer look

2647
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:09,480
five minute chart on the NASDAQ

2648
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,520
here's that price run here

2649
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,139
then we have this by Center balance

2650
01:38:13,139 --> 01:38:15,120
outside and efficiency we'll get to that

2651
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,699
in a moment and then we run up we have a

2652
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:19,380
blow off move and then we break down

2653
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,820
where's the fair value here

2654
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:25,860
there isn't one in here not on this side

2655
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,739
of the curve the curve is here and then

2656
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:29,940
damp

2657
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,980
so you have to use the imbalance on the

2658
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,480
left side

2659
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,860
that's going to be an inversion of

2660
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,540
everybody go

2661
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,400
extend that through all the price action

2662
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,320
that's what you're seeing here

2663
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,580
then you have a small little Fair bag

2664
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,780
out there that I didn't want to draw any

2665
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,000
annotations on because we have the

2666
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,380
inversion frame rate I can pull it out

2667
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,120
like I'm doing here trades up into it

2668
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,699
here then we break

2669
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:54,840
this area here is a breakaica

2670
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,940
we want to see it stay open

2671
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,100
so why should it become a breakaway Gap

2672
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,380
because we have had a shift in Market

2673
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,540
structure there

2674
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,580
we have a bystanding balance outside and

2675
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,560
efficiency why trade the NASDAQ and not

2676
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,820
the s p ICT I'm telling you right now

2677
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,620
relative equal lows blow off move after

2678
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,940
the market has been going straight up

2679
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:18,000
all week as we were expecting it to do

2680
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,560
and then we have the inversion fair

2681
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,540
value Gap is it respecting that yep and

2682
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,639
then we break below the short term low

2683
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:25,980
here below this short term low here and

2684
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,020
where's liquidity at below here sell

2685
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:28,860
sign

2686
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,620
but then we have this bison efficiency

2687
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,659
so any Rally from this Candlestick open

2688
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:36,360
up in to Above This High we want to see

2689
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,860
it stay open what happens if it closes

2690
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,000
in it's okay

2691
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,560
I would still want to kick a short up

2692
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,239
there if I was watching live

2693
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,580
and the market breaks down

2694
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:47,100
doesn't get below the what the bodies so

2695
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,900
we still have this Wick to contend with

2696
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,280
so we retrace higher

2697
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,659
up close candles consecutively that's a

2698
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:56,699
bearish order block

2699
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,739
breaks down through it

2700
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,300
extend the opening price over there

2701
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,219
that's a change in state of delivery

2702
01:40:02,219 --> 01:40:05,639
returns back into a here and all of this

2703
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,100
consolidation is time Distortion it's

2704
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,900
not time for the market to do anything

2705
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,080
it's not going to do it it's already ran

2706
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,960
the low here which is the lunch Macro

2707
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,120
for New York it's already did that but

2708
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,460
we're not done we have TGIF

2709
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,620
it's Friday so thank God it's Friday

2710
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,500
it's likely to do what 20 to 30 of the

2711
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,000
weekly range in terms of a retracement

2712
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,380
from the high of the week where's the

2713
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,060
high of the week over here when can we

2714
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:31,560
trust that's the high of the week when

2715
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,360
we see this element here and then we

2716
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,620
start seeing everything start breaking

2717
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,199
down this high is intact

2718
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,239
but what happens if it runs up and goes

2719
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:40,920
higher then you're wrong how's that for

2720
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,179
logic you're going to get it wrong

2721
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:43,440
sometimes

2722
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,300
but you have to have rules and things to

2723
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,920
work with to grow in your understanding

2724
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,239
as a Trader and this is what I'm sharing

2725
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:53,340
with you what time does time distortion

2726
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:54,719
stop

2727
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,360
what did I teach you post New York lunch

2728
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,179
we start seeing two o'clock to four

2729
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:03,179
o'clock that's your PM session time

2730
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:04,920
then all of a sudden what happens the

2731
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,540
market delivers a run through

2732
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,980
low

2733
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,360
or low

2734
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,920
very bad you got

2735
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,080
trades up into it

2736
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,880
CE of the low on

2737
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,620
this Wick

2738
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,000
boom

2739
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,400
sells off hits the SSL

2740
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:27,000
And Trades to 20 level of the weekly

2741
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,440
candlestick

2742
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,380
so from the high to the low measure that

2743
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,800
and it retraces 20 of the weekly range

2744
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,719
in here

2745
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,119
blow out the cell cell side and then

2746
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,639
close real close to which is not noted

2747
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:45,119
here but look at the commentary I did on

2748
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,239
July 15 2023 the video right before this

2749
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:49,500
one

2750
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,659
and you'll see the TGIF levels and how

2751
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:53,460
the fine Diamond markdown on your chart

2752
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:56,400
this is all the details and that was not

2753
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,159
in that presentation

2754
01:41:59,159 --> 01:42:02,639
this is what was in my trade idea that

2755
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:03,719
uh

2756
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:06,480
wasn't cherry-picked I elected to use

2757
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,580
the NASDAQ because it was

2758
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:11,880
more exposed to inefficiency here

2759
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,739
and it was much more energetic on the

2760
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:16,199
upside and much more energy on the

2761
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:18,600
downside so it had a better structure

2762
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,480
than that of es that was the reason why

2763
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,239
I did DS es got real close to doing a 20

2764
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,940
retracement of its weekly range

2765
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,520
if you still traded ES

2766
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,840
you still would have been able to find

2767
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,480
profitability doing it so it's not an

2768
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,540
argument about you know es and NASDAQ

2769
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,440
which one you should have been in

2770
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,639
because they both offered the

2771
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,639
opportunity but NASDAQ I was in and

2772
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:44,639
NASDAQ was just a beautiful delivery

2773
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,820
thank you

2774
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,040
right and here's a one minute chart of

2775
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,619
that time of day here's

2776
01:42:52,619 --> 01:42:55,199
the PM session and I want you to see

2777
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,880
that

2778
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,520
inefficiency that bison let me take you

2779
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,659
back up so that way you know where I'm

2780
01:43:00,659 --> 01:43:03,420
pointing your attention to this range

2781
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,000
right here okay we're looking at a five

2782
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,260
minute chart we're going to drop down

2783
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,520
into a one minute chart and look at

2784
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,800
Price action from here to here okay

2785
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,840
that's what we're watching but in this

2786
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,239
shaded area right here I'm going to put

2787
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:19,199
the gradients in 25 50 and 75.

2788
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,659
we're going to look at this return back

2789
01:43:21,659 --> 01:43:22,980
into that

2790
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,100
shaded area here okay so here's the

2791
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,139
lower quadrant or 25 percent of the

2792
01:43:28,139 --> 01:43:29,820
range that's shaded here

2793
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,880
so here's the high 75 of that range 50

2794
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,820
of that range 25 of that range and the

2795
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:37,440
low of it

2796
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,000
so the market trades up into that and

2797
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,080
we'll come back that in a second let's

2798
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,520
go back up into here and look at some of

2799
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,739
the details

2800
01:43:43,739 --> 01:43:47,100
right away this should jump off at you

2801
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,080
that's a breakaway Gap why why should

2802
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,639
that be a very wake up because we are

2803
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,739
under time Distortion that means all

2804
01:43:52,739 --> 01:43:55,139
this back and forth price action is just

2805
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:57,659
marking time that's the benefit of

2806
01:43:57,659 --> 01:43:59,880
knowing how to use a time-based chart

2807
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,219
I'm not getting fooled by candlesticks

2808
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:04,380
I'm waiting for time when does it start

2809
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,420
right there two o'clock in the afternoon

2810
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,860
New York local time because the market

2811
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:10,199
is driven by an algorithm there's a time

2812
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:11,940
for everything

2813
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:14,520
a beginning and an end

2814
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,880
a pause a consolidation and Distortion

2815
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,340
where everything you try to do will chop

2816
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,719
you up

2817
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:24,179
so you wait wait for what two o'clock

2818
01:44:24,179 --> 01:44:27,060
and then wait for displacement what does

2819
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:29,100
that look like right here

2820
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,920
takes out that short-term love boom but

2821
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,360
now we have what we're late in the day

2822
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,880
this shaded area here is the Bots animal

2823
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,920
cell sign efficiency we have moved away

2824
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,780
from the high and we moved aggressively

2825
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:46,199
away from the 75 percent upper 75 range

2826
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:48,719
of this shaded area so I don't want to

2827
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:51,060
see this area come back into I don't

2828
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,139
want to see it come back up and trade

2829
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:53,880
into that but if it does I would treat

2830
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,080
it as an Institutional order flow

2831
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,300
integral in other words a partial entry

2832
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,760
and then sell off

2833
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:01,139
either way it makes it a breakaway Gap

2834
01:45:01,139 --> 01:45:03,239
so we don't want to see it trade back up

2835
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:06,300
above 50 or consequent encouragement on

2836
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,760
this shaded area here and now we enter

2837
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,820
into another time of day

2838
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:16,260
the 250 to 310 macro my algorithm starts

2839
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:19,380
at 250 to 310 and we'll start spooling

2840
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,179
price running for the liquidity that has

2841
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:22,560
not been purged yet what is that

2842
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,900
liquidity the liquidity below the lows

2843
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:28,380
the 7 A.M New York session time

2844
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:34,500
the 830 lows the 9 30 to 11 lows all of

2845
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,420
that is the draw on liquidity

2846
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,480
and or in this case 20 of the weekly

2847
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,760
range that would be anywhere in this

2848
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,739
area here

2849
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:45,480
but we start to see this energetic price

2850
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,699
run aggressive dropping lower that's

2851
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:49,619
algorithmic

2852
01:45:49,619 --> 01:45:51,300
this

2853
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,679
right here just like I talked about

2854
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,920
earlier when we ran up

2855
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,659
you can use the FVG on the

2856
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:59,460
left side of the Curve and we've seen

2857
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,080
that happen right there if it would have

2858
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,060
been opening here trade it up right

2859
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,340
there if I was wanting to trade short

2860
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:07,139
and I hadn't already been short that

2861
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:08,280
would be an area where I would go short

2862
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:09,840
right there too

2863
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,239
then it breaks this is a measuring Gap

2864
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,920
we don't want to see that filled in just

2865
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,880
like we don't want to see that what

2866
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,380
makes this a measuring cup

2867
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,600
well between this High down to this low

2868
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,699
we're expecting that run in about

2869
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:22,260
halfway

2870
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,659
we're expecting a gap to form when it

2871
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:26,699
does and it moves away from it we are

2872
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:28,139
not expecting it to come back into that

2873
01:46:28,139 --> 01:46:30,360
that's a measuring Gap you have to know

2874
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:31,860
where the market is likely to draw too

2875
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:33,719
if you don't have that skill set you

2876
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,159
will not be consistent in your ability

2877
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:39,060
to find or classify a measuring guy

2878
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,400
Breakaway gaps are just gaps when you

2879
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,199
want to see an energetic price run away

2880
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,080
from an area you anticipated prior to

2881
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,699
it running away

2882
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:49,500
so you're expecting it to move lower

2883
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,699
great

2884
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:52,560
when it finally does and it creates a

2885
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,239
gap like this your first thought should

2886
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,159
be okay the first favorite you got after

2887
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,199
it starts to run that should be a

2888
01:46:58,199 --> 01:46:59,340
breakaway Gap we want to see that

2889
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,119
especially if we've been in

2890
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:02,159
consolidation or experiencing time

2891
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,739
Distortion time Distortion is simply a

2892
01:47:04,739 --> 01:47:08,520
matter of time between segments of time

2893
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,380
of the day where markets will start

2894
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,960
spooling that's it that's a very simple

2895
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,280
thing it doesn't mean that you should

2896
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,480
understand it right away because I said

2897
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,219
that but over time when you come back to

2898
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:19,020
these lessons like this or refer back to

2899
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:20,400
new future lessons that I'll talk about

2900
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,199
it it'll make perfect sense to you

2901
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:24,000
because you haven't been exposed to it

2902
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,500
enough times to know exactly what I'm

2903
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,179
referring to

2904
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:29,340
the market finally rips below the sell

2905
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,199
side liquidity does it multiple times in

2906
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,940
here and then consolidates at the close

2907
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,280
going into 20 percent of the range of

2908
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,960
nasdaq's weekly candle

2909
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,100
all right folks so

2910
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:47,659
I covered a lot of stuff here and I will

2911
01:47:47,659 --> 01:47:50,760
admit rather openly that this is not one

2912
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,060
of those easy go out there and I can do

2913
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,880
what ICT has taught me okay but I'm

2914
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,280
showing you many things here I'm showing

2915
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,139
you a Amplified version of what we do by

2916
01:48:04,139 --> 01:48:06,900
reading the tape I've rung in macros

2917
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,119
I've rung in time of day I've rung in

2918
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,580
how we use Breakaway gaps and measuring

2919
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:14,040
gaps and how we anticipate price action

2920
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,380
and we don't look for ladders depth of

2921
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,360
Market footprint or anythings because

2922
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,340
we're anticipating price performing a

2923
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:21,960
specific function

2924
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,840
we understand order flow what kind of

2925
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,340
order flow institutional order flow

2926
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,199
institutional order flow is going to be

2927
01:48:28,199 --> 01:48:30,119
based on the things I'm showing you here

2928
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:34,139
price is the thing that's the that's the

2929
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:37,739
context that's the that's the prize that

2930
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:40,619
we seek the better understanding of that

2931
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:42,360
you can take the Open high low and close

2932
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,219
of every interval

2933
01:48:44,219 --> 01:48:46,739
and beat it up torture it with number

2934
01:48:46,739 --> 01:48:49,199
crunching and have it come out with all

2935
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:52,020
kinds of supposed insights

2936
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,600
some kind of mathematically derived

2937
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,560
indicator or you can take the past and

2938
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,840
say okay this is how many contracts were

2939
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,100
bought or sold at this price and

2940
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,380
therefore I believe this or that or you

2941
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:06,719
can look at a range above the

2942
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,699
marketplace price or below the

2943
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:09,960
marketplace price

2944
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,780
and determine and there's a larger range

2945
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,980
of

2946
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,840
or number of orders above the

2947
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,480
marketplace than that of below it and

2948
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,420
you might think that that is indicative

2949
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,780
of wanting to go higher not always

2950
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:26,760
think about it what happens if you're in

2951
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,860
these types of situations here

2952
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:31,500
where you're right before the market is

2953
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,540
going to start going lower

2954
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:35,580
but your depth of Market your latter

2955
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:38,040
suggests that there's a lot of orders

2956
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,679
just above the market price

2957
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:42,719
you might be convinced by looking at

2958
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:45,000
just that tool thinking that okay it

2959
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,560
should start going higher and eat into

2960
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:49,440
that number no that might be just a

2961
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,639
large pool of smart monies stop loss

2962
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:55,139
that isn't going to be tripped that

2963
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,960
isn't going to be eroded or eaten into

2964
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,760
and then you watch price run away and

2965
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,340
you're thinking yourself wow look at

2966
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:04,980
that rip wow look at that where'd that

2967
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:06,060
come from what just happened somebody

2968
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:07,800
must be talking all these things folks

2969
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,600
all these things come out of the mouths

2970
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,520
of people that just don't know how to do

2971
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,960
this yet

2972
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,480
and I want them to learn that's all I

2973
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,800
want them to learn just like you I want

2974
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,719
them to understand how they can capture

2975
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:20,880
these types of price runs and not hurt

2976
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,000
themselves in the process

2977
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,380
so if we found this one insightful

2978
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:26,520
hopeless

2979
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,320
edifying for you until I'll talk to you

2980
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,400
next time

2981
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,119
be safe
