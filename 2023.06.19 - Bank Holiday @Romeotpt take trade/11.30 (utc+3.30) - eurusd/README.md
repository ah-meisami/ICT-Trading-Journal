the eurusd chart is better viewed on FXCM.com than FOREX.com, also it is in compatible with MT4 chart.

1. Validation of Range: When price respecting 50% of the range then you can reasonably anticipate that range to hold that range.  
2. Range High taken out in to HTF PD-Array (-OB[1h]) means Turtle Soup Strategy.  
3. Break down: Shift in momentum from bullish to bearish.  
4. Re-trade in to order block (-OB[15m]) which is a Turtle Soup.  
5. I am not looking at PD-Arrays so much. I am looking at highs and lows above\under\inside .  
6. Turtle Soup >> Decline. Turtle Soup >> Decline. Turtle Soup >> Decline.  
7. Turtle Soup inside High Probability Order block.  
8. This is a Range(LTF[5m]) inside another Range(HTF[15m]).
9. Price Respect Bearish PD-Array (-BB[5m]) and Disrespect bullish PD-Array (+OB[5m]) which is confluence.  

High Probability Order block Rules:  
  1. Inside Liquidity Pool
  2. Thick Volume Candle (Push price towards price where you want to go, that's order flow)
  3. FVG

Definition of Breaker block:  
  1. Last down close candle
  2. or the last down close candle before the purge
 
Three Main Ways of Stop loss:  
  1. The HTF PD-Array (more sure but less Risk-Reward)  
  2. using intermediate term high (ITH), intermediate term low (ITL)  
  3. Lowe time frame change state of delivery (LTF-CSD)
