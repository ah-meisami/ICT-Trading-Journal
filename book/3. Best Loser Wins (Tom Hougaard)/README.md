What 99% of people do not realise is that when you win, 
there are things happening in your brain chemistry, 
which – if left unnoticed and unchecked – will have a detrimental effect on your decision making.

Anything in Life Worth Doing, is Worth Overdoing.

The truth of the matter is that you can clearly see the difference between a consistently profitable trader and a normal trader. Their approach is very different.
1.Account size.
2.Trade frequency.
3.Ratio of time spent holding winning trades versus losing trades.
4.Adding to winning or adding to losing trades.
5.Trading with a stop-loss.

For every hour you spend on technical analysis, 
you must set aside at least 25% of that time for what I call [internal-analysis]. 
You need to know what your weaknesses are. 
You need to know what your strengths are. 
You need to know what you are good at, and you need to know what you are not good at.

INTERVIEW WITH CNN : main differences between Retail traders & Large Fund Traders
1. TRYING TO FIND THE LOW
2. TRYING TO FIND THE HIGH
3. THINKING EVERY SMALL COUNTER-MOVE AGAINST A TREND IS THE START OF A NEW TREND
  - This is a common trait amongst traders. They think that every single little counter reaction against the trend is the beginning of a new trend.

Tom: I think you are trading yesterday’s experience. You haven’t wiped the mind-slate clean. You are not present. You are focused on the past. You are trying to get back to an emotional equilibrium. You are in a state of imbalance because you are unable to shake the loss from yesterday. As a result, you are not judging the trade on its own merit, but on the merit of a past trade. You are not seeing the world as it is. You are seeing it as you are.

I don’t think Tiger is a better golfer than me, if you measure it in how well we putt, or how far we hit the ball, but Tiger Woods does have an amazing ability to forget his mistakes and move on.

Failure is one of our greatest learning tools.

THE CURSE OF PATTERNS [01:55:13]



PATTERNICITY
“Tom, you only see in the markets and on charts what you have trained your eyes to see.”
We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.

You must be patient with yourself. 
You must be able to let your knowledge settle and mature within you.
If you trade small size now, but you want to trade bigger size in the future, 
then that journey will most likely be anything but linear.




The coordination between the eyes and the mind is fascinating. 
The eyes can see one thing, while the reactive impulse mind tells us that we are seeing something else.
It is only through observance and training that we become mindful of our tendency to believe what we immediately think we see.



No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.
Mankind has an ambivalent attitude to change. 
We want change, because otherwise our lives become mundane and boring; 
but if the change is thrust upon us, rather than driven by motivation and enthusiasm, 
then we tend to resent it.



However, a share, or a currency, or a share index, is like a river. 
It is in constant transformation. 
The transformation is the result of the interaction of traders and investors.




=========================================================================================================
Our minds struggle to separate the world of trading from the world of general consumer behaviour. Let’s look at the differences.

If my free mind argues for a position, 
and my fear mind argues about the consequences of failing on that trade, 
then I am essentially arguing with myself. The posh term for this phenomenon is cognitive dissonance.


You need to teach your brain to be hopeful (about profits) 
when it is wrongly fearful (about losing the profits). 
You need to teach your brain to be fearful (about losses) when it is mistakenly hopeful (about the position turning positive).


Why is it easier to add to a losing position than to a winning position?

The key point here is: what is your mind dwelling on?

When we add to a losing position, we decide to dwell on the potential for bigger profits. We decide not to dwell on the fact that the market is telling us we are wrong. We decide not to dwell on the fact we have just doubled our risk.

#BestLoserWins   2023.08.02
A very wise old trader once told me that losers spend their time thinking how much they will make, while winners spend their time thinking about how much they will lose.


I am not trading the chart. I am trading my account. I am trading my state of mind. I am trying to get rid of the pain from my previous trade. 

The pain of having missed out on the rally towards the end of the day was greater than the pleasure from making back what I had lost earlier in the day.


=========================================================================================================
The key to victory starts with being mindful of the existence of two brains: conscious mind vs. subconscious mind
For the subconscious brain there are two pains in trading. There is the pain of seeing a profit. When it sees a profit, it wants you to close it because then it doesn’t have to deal with the pain of seeing the profit disappear. Then there is the pain of loss. When the subconscious brain sees a loss, it wants you to hold on to the position a little longer and a little longer. Otherwise, it will have to deal with taking the loss. As long as the position is open, there is always hope.

In a nutshell, what separates the 10% of winners from the 90% of losers is which brain they are listening to. It took me many years to realise this. I developed a system for my mind, a training program that enabled me to withstand the influences of the emotional subconscious brain on my trading decisions.
