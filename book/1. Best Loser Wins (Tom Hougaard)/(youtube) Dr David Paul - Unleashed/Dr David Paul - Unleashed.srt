1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,359
what can you say when you lose somebody

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,639
like David Paul God he enriched the

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,099
lives of everyone unbelievable the

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,960
thousands of people that he met I mean

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
it was incredible the most amazing thing

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,580
about it from my perspective is the

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,220
depth of knowledge and the humility by

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,680
which he presented it I mean there's not

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,420
many people like him around folks and

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,000
he's not here anymore but his legacy

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,920
will live on forever because he trained

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,080
one of the best traders that I've ever

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,120
met who was a great Trader Tom who guard

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,640
and David Paul turned him into one of

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,040
the greatest Traders I have ever met

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,719
he's done things that I didn't think

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,059
were possible it was mainly because of

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,160
the work of David and he was almost like

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,739
a father to him and it worked out great

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
for both of them he will certainly be

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,000
missed I was able to trade with David

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,280
one day and I was absolutely impressed

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,039
about how simple the methodology that he

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,100
used worked his whole idea was when you

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,840
find something that you really like and

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,699
you know it's going to work and you have

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,319
a pretty good idea what your risk is you

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,659
have to a bit big and that's what it was

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,880
all about is risk little and bet big and

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
he did this with an incredible amount of

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,820
success

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,979
David's personality is what really

33
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,659
brought everybody together because of

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,220
his love of the business the way he

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,560
handled people and he didn't have any

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
strangers anybody that came up to him

37
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,060
absolutely loved the man and he he will

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,159
really be missed he he was a really a

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,479
stand-up guy

40
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,840
and I can tell you this that by golly I

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,580
I will certainly miss him I only got to

42
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,340
know him for about 10 years but uh it

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,140
was really something to really know this

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,759
gentlemen so if you ever see any work by

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,400
him pay close attention because he was

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,979
the real deal and he was a stand-up guy

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,619
in anybody's book Larry pessimano

48
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,100
signing off folks and may God bless

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,159
uh so I I don't know I've told you guys

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,320
this story but uh

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,259
when my son started to trade I told him

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,000
to

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,380
did I tell that on Friday

54
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,799
when my when my son started to trade I

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,160
uh told him to watch videos of Tom at

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,099
saxo bank that were done 12 15 years ago

57
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,340
of that order and his trademark of the

58
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,160
day was a a three-piece sit you know

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,860
with the old west coat and that dreaded

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,480
black tie that he used to wear

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
everywhere so

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,459
uh Mike watched us any uh

63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,459
text me back he said he's the James Bond

64
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,360
of trading

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,500
and to this to this day and Friday uh he

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,599
sent me a what's up message he says give

67
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,920
my regards to bond

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,959
so it's a compliment I assure you so a

69
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,780
compliment ah so and I believe Daniel

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,019
Craig is giving the job up so you could

71
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,739
be in the running I'll

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,680
I don't well I don't know I don't know

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,160
where those

74
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,599
so folks let's let's let's go into some

75
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,560
charts but you've been in lots and lots

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,780
of charts what I tried to do in the last

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,300
two hours I believe from the bottom of

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,060
my heart uh dealing with literally

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,940
hundreds and thousands of Traders uh

80
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,900
that

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,379
that's what they need and

82
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,500
unfortunately the more they resist

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,140
the stuff that I just spoke about that

84
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,120
will be directly proportional to their

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,099
failure as a Trader

86
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,700
I'm afraid okay

87
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,220
coming to terms with uncertainty is

88
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,080
difficult really really difficult

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,060
especially if if you're from the

90
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,019
professions and in Chicago they sort of

91
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,260
use a dentist for uh the the classic

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,480
professional and you've got to say to

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
yourself a dentist wants to trade what

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,500
does he know about risk what is the

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,299
chances of you getting past that dentist

96
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,640
receptionist without showing your credit

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
card to pay for the bill

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,480
I don't know what Danish risk dentist

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
receptionists are like but the ones in

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,019
the UK you wouldn't stand a chance

101
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,298
there'll be one grizzled battle ax

102
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,160
sitting there

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,100
and she'll want her lit before you leave

104
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,360
uh soap

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,860
rule number one the good trait is a hard

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,419
trade

107
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,720
you know who taught me that

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,919
delightful old man he was one of the

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,259
first Market Wizards Michael steinhardt

110
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,699
do you know him Larry

111
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,520
I know him so well he's 90 these days

112
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,139
91. he's still trading my word he's made

113
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,620
a hemp he trashed those uh indices for

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,220
25 years uh and he was the inspiration

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,259
for me in fact buying oil right at the

116
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,620
Lowe's I was just that classic Michael

117
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,100
steinhardt trade and please Google uh

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,860
Michael steinhardt uh he was one of the

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,040
original Market Wizards uh he has got

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,360
cast iron you know what's in his day uh

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
he was something uh uh a really

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,680
privileged to speak to him on one

123
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,400
occasion uh rule number two guys the

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,660
good Trends are hard to it I'm not

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,180
saying it's intellectually difficult

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,820
okay in fact as I said in Friday the

127
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
thicker you are the better but it's just

128
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,199
difficult to do the Market's roaring

129
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,660
down three big red bars

130
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,240
put Sophia God into you I know some

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
idiot tells you you must step in and buy

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,139
it it was really really difficult

133
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,460
okay

134
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,440
very difficult to do uh so uh

135
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,720
that's a characteristic of a good trade

136
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,380
uh if the thread seems easy there's a

137
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,880
good chance you're just about to be

138
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,220
sexually violated and that's fine if you

139
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,560
like that sort of thing okay uh

140
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,500
rule number two I want to feed the

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,360
short-term Trend in the direction of the

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,100
long-term trend

143
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,080
he's smiling do you like that sort of

144
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,340
thing

145
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,639
okay

146
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,259
we've heard all about you Danish fellas

147
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,360
yeah ripping and pillaging

148
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,819
uh so fade the short-term Trend in the

149
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,680
direction of the long-term Trend so what

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,900
I'm saying is that I've got a long-term

151
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,240
Trend in place and I want to buy a

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,759
pullback uh and Let It Go Again guess

153
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,120
what that is

154
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
AV blessed CD okay so I wonder where I

155
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,300
got that from

156
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,780
and uh then the third row

157
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,880
I want to put my entries where the

158
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,840
masses put their stops how's that

159
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
on your way home

160
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,979
I want you to pass

161
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,780
a building site

162
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,060
and on the building site you pick up a

163
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,960
brick

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,020
okay you take that back home

165
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,300
and tomorrow when you're about to put on

166
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,139
your first trade

167
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,400
decide where you're getting in

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,919
just before you press the button you

169
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,139
pick the brick up and you go smack it

170
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,819
against your head

171
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,620
that puts you into the present moment

172
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,380
and here's what I want you to do

173
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,599
rather than buying the market at where

174
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,740
you thought you were going to buy the

175
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,380
market buy them put an order in at where

176
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,060
you were going to put your stop and see

177
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,860
how often the damn thing goes to your

178
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,259
stop okay

179
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,780
so uh

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,819
place your entries where the Masters

181
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,139
place your stops and this is another

182
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,060
thing I learned from Larry is that the

183
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,979
best traits occur when the masses have

184
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,560
been stopped and trapped

185
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,319
so even if you don't get in at the cusp

186
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,419
of the turn if you can look back and see

187
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,639
that a whole just obvious on the chart

188
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,500
that lots of people would have bought

189
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
there and then the bloody thing went

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,099
down again nailed them and then reversed

191
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,380
if you get in after those people have

192
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,539
nailed then you're on a much better

193
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,400
place

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,940
okay

195
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
and of course that's difficult because

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,860
we're scared of missing out at least I

197
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,120
am

198
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,639
okay uh so uh

199
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,680
so I'm going to talk about a little bit

200
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,860
about Richard Wyckoff and I know uh many

201
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,958
people say that volume doesn't work but

202
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
uh volume uh especially in the stock

203
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
market is a great great Edge

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,700
and if I have the discipline

205
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,160
if I have the discipline

206
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,459
to in the stock market to wait for a

207
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,040
volume coming to the party I can get my

208
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,620
head rate up to 80 percent

209
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,880
uh when volume hits me between the eyes

210
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,440
so uh Richard weichel died in 1934 his

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,560
work was carried on by many many people

212
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
I bought this original course in the

213
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
early 1980s and I went through it and

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
please do not buy a white golf's works

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,899
and this course unless you're prepared

216
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,760
to put a great deal of effort into it

217
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm not saying you won't do that but

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,880
it's certainly not something that you're

219
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
going to take in on a Sunday afternoon

220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,839
while you're putting back three or four

221
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,180
frosties okay that's not going to work

222
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,080
he writes in the uh like the king

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
James's version of the Bible it's all

224
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,740
these and the eyes really really

225
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,800
difficult going as ganned it so his

226
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,839
three laws supply and demand

227
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,260
uh cause and effect effort and result

228
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,300
so I'm I'm

229
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,360
my slides are not as good and I've

230
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
so the the rule is it the price action

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,420
and the chart must reflect the volume

232
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,339
action below it

233
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,240
uh if the volume demand is large and the

234
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,880
price a move is large then price is

235
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,800
acting rationally

236
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,620
if they don't then that in Wyckoff

237
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,100
terminology is known as a non-validation

238
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,279
and that's a leading indicator

239
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,300
uh and an opportunity for profit so uh

240
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,180
for example a large change in price and

241
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,640
low volume so we got a breakout on low

242
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,420
volume uh then that's a known validation

243
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,200
and

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,700
markets on any time frame rising and

245
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,080
falling volume need to be carefully

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,339
watched

247
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,839
uh

248
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,160
and all of this came from the old fellas

249
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Livermore Wyckoff and a whole host of

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,260
traders of that era just reading the

251
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,880
tape the only thing that was on the tape

252
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,740
was price and volume

253
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,260
so what Wyckoff tried to do in his chart

254
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,839
reading and his course was to try and

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,140
give the retail Trader the ability and

256
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,480
the education to be able to read the

257
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,380
tape

258
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,920
in terms of price and volume

259
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,620
uh and I love the wake of stuff I really

260
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,700
do and it's a complicated Theory uh

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,320
fella in the stock market there's a

262
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,120
gentleman called Stanley Weinstein

263
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,940
that's written uh quite a few books on

264
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,060
the longer term uh aspects of the

265
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Wyckoff technique uh no

266
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,579
when I presented this before at the

267
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,079
institutional level to a bunch of

268
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,300
quantitative Traders they were not happy

269
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,519
because they wanted something that they

270
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,399
could quantify exactly and wake up is

271
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,640
not like that and he said in this course

272
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,459
look at the last 20 bars of trading and

273
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,399
any time frame and make a judgment

274
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,079
on the Range is it high average or low

275
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,300
the position of the close is it near the

276
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,640
high mid-range near the close and volume

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,399
High average or low

278
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,500
that's what he looked at now you're more

279
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,600
than welcome to quantify that even more

280
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,519
and certainly some of her VectorVest

281
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,000
people quantify volume around a 50-day

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,140
moving average of volume

283
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,579
higher or lower than a 50-day moving

284
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,560
average volume and we can scan for that

285
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,459
on VectorVest so let's just have a crack

286
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,399
can you see the black bars on that

287
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,100
uh before Tom does it I'll put those in

288
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,140
a different color but that's wide

289
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,860
average and low as and that's close on

290
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,899
the high close in the mid range close on

291
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,300
the low I I thought that would have come

292
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,720
out better when I did it at home uh uh

293
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,240
and there's volume high volume meddling

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,459
volume and low volume so you just look

295
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,560
back on the chart and you judge what's

296
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,300
low volume what's high volume what's

297
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,459
average volume that's how Wyckoff did it

298
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,079
that's how I do it

299
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,480
by all means quantify that a little bit

300
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
better but

301
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
in terms of validation folks

302
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,639
if you've got a a big range bar

303
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,839
with above average volume that closes in

304
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,700
the top 80 percent of the range or the

305
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,800
top half of the range then all is good

306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,019
and in that moment whatever that moment

307
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,680
is five minutes one hour one day one

308
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,380
week one month then you should do your

309
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,360
best to let it run

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,660
uh and and similarly if you've got a

311
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,339
narrow range bar

312
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,320
maybe you could put those lights down a

313
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,079
little bit sir at the back there uh

314
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,980
there's not

315
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,899
I I should have made that a different

316
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,240
color I'm sorry about that it looked

317
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,660
fine on my computer screen at home

318
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,180
if you've got low volume and a very

319
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,700
small range that's also good

320
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,279
that's fine

321
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,320
so small

322
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,680
result small effort that's good

323
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,120
everything's in sync

324
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,260
now

325
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,160
where you get

326
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
a non-validation is that if you get a

327
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,360
big bar

328
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,399
on low volume

329
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,779
now that can happen easily at a Breakout

330
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,940
and it can happen easily at the end of a

331
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,700
trend where the the price keeps running

332
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,820
on low volume now let's look at the

333
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,560
housing market at the moment certainly

334
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
in the UK and from discussions with

335
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,060
Kathy in the US as well we've got a

336
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,399
situation where our prices are rising

337
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,959
and volumes Rising I don't know what

338
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,800
it's like in Denmark

339
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,959
now sooner or later you'll find that

340
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,480
volumes will stay up there

341
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,060
and prices will go flat

342
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,100
well that's the next step and that can

343
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,820
happen very quickly

344
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,519
so we'll get a if you if you examine the

345
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,440
results carefully you're going to get a

346
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,600
non-validation between the volumes of

347
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,180
homes sold and the prices at the moment

348
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,399
everything's going Rosy but it changes

349
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,320
very quickly indeed at the top of a

350
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,500
market

351
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,540
that's the next step just watch out for

352
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,220
that any of you that are involved in

353
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,600
property

354
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,820
just look at the monthly stats at the

355
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,920
minute volumes are rising prices are

356
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
rising certainly in the UK that's the

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,160
case

358
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,779
The Next Step

359
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,480
will be that volume stay up there but

360
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,519
prices just don't go in other words

361
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,079
you've got to flood the sellers into the

362
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,180
market all that volume can't push the

363
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,560
price up anymore

364
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,300
and then all of a sudden you get a turn

365
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,940
that's a non-validation happens in every

366
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,079
Market uh so uh

367
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,519
now

368
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,040
this is an interesting one and this

369
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,880
happens frequently at at the end and

370
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,220
this is what many Traders call a volume

371
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,019
climax

372
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,740
well you get lots and lots of volume

373
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,959
and no movement

374
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,100
nothing than the next step in the uh

375
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,019
housing market in my opinion no what's

376
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,579
happening here now this is going to be

377
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,800
easy for the Danish people let's say

378
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,500
that you're in your car on a miserable

379
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,180
cold night

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,320
right

381
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,560
and there's lots of snow around

382
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,720
and you're going up a hill

383
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,579
use your mind's eye here you're going up

384
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,980
a hill and you put foot as they say in

385
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,800
South Africa and you're moving up

386
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,380
and all of a sudden the wheels start to

387
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,339
spin

388
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,680
on the ice yeah

389
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,180
and you put foot again

390
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,920
and you go a little bit further but you

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,560
can't make any traction and then you put

392
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
foot again but it doesn't matter how

393
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,720
hard you put your foot you slide back

394
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,519
and that's what's called a volume climax

395
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,380
lots and lots of volume

396
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,040
no action in the price that's that's I

397
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,839
think that's probably a quarter to two

398
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,679
quarters away in the housing market

399
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,660
in my humble opinion okay uh so that is

400
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,540
a non-validation and that can certainly

401
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,179
give you a heads up on what's Happening

402
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,020
so and then that's a bar by bar

403
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,099
non-validation now it gets more

404
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,260
interesting because we can now look at a

405
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,459
multi-bar

406
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,400
and if you've got let's say three bars

407
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,799
up uh you've got

408
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,580
um

409
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,880
good ranging bars the the range is

410
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,980
getting bigger on the bars and volume is

411
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,400
rising all is good all is good

412
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,460
and the same on a down Market uh uh but

413
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,440
you can get a non-validation quite

414
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,919
easily

415
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,500
there's the price Rising uh we've got a

416
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,600
big big range bar but the volume can't

417
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,140
come to the party that's a non

418
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,000
validation I'm not saying that there's

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
something up here you've got to be

420
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
careful now the mistake that I made

421
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,559
at the outset with volume is that I

422
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,419
actually try to react to the volume and

423
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,940
volume is not like price you can't react

424
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,880
to it immediately it is a subtle warning

425
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
of the future

426
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,100
that's all it is the heads up you so it

427
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,320
could take three four five bars for the

428
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
change similarly in the housing market

429
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
it could take many many months for it to

430
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,460
top out before it changes Direction

431
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,320
but it's close in the housing market

432
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,559
what do you think Larry it's close

433
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,840
um my professional opinion is setting to

434
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,820
my right she is never wrong on the

435
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,020
housing market if you ask her okay

436
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,020
I will later on

437
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,679
[Music]

438
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,440
okay all right well that I'm watching it

439
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,320
carefully at the moment because I I'm as

440
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,299
I say I have a love of horses I've got a

441
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,799
horse in the country but I need a place

442
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,500
in the country to keep my own horse uh

443
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,679
and uh a man is lost without a horse and

444
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,179
a border collie uh so there is uh this

445
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,580
is a little uh stock and that at the

446
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,039
last it was going up nicely and then at

447
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
the end we've got a

448
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
at the end we've got a bar and as you

449
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,299
can see it couldn't close at the top of

450
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,820
that bar on huge volume that's a heads

451
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,220
up that's a heads up

452
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,960
it was a great deal there's a lot of

453
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
volume but there was a great deal of

454
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,120
Supply at the top of that bar

455
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,340
all these things are are heads up you're

456
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,020
not going to trade them you're not going

457
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,360
to put orders in based on this but it's

458
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,620
a heads up and if I see a a

459
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,580
non-validation it's uh a reason not to

460
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,919
add to a position it's in fact a reason

461
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,340
to actually lighten a position

462
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,559
so during the day

463
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,740
I and I'll show you

464
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,520
a a better schematic of this now this

465
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,559
drawing that I hope you can see more

466
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,160
clearly uh I did at my first technical

467
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,840
analysis seminar at the University of

468
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,320
Cape Town in 1989 I had a full head of

469
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,320
hair at the time uh

470
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,140
as price Rises folks volume should rise

471
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,700
with it

472
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,220
and as price pulls back we should see

473
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,340
volume drying up

474
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,320
simple as that

475
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,860
and at this low believe it or not in

476
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,919
that low there's no volume at all

477
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,240
right at the turning point

478
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,960
so

479
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,179
the great question of course

480
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,280
and you all you all must have said this

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,580
to yourself uh the rule says buy

482
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,740
pullback but when the pullback is

483
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,960
occurring your little mind is moving to

484
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,520
the Future and then saying to yourself

485
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,620
well this may not be a pullback at all

486
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,360
this could be a change in Trend and I'm

487
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,919
going to buy it and I'm going to feel

488
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,660
like I write proper

489
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,559
plonker

490
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,580
so if you see the price pulling back on

491
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,240
falling volume

492
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,860
that's a very good sign that we're still

493
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,720
in a bull market and that's the primary

494
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,760
definition of a bull market

495
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Rising range is expanding on Rising

496
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,820
volume pulling back and falling volume

497
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,679
if I see that then I'm quite happy to

498
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,320
buy into that market and and you can see

499
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,539
that as clear as day so those of you

500
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,480
that give volume a bit of a hard time on

501
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,580
an intraday chart if you see a couple of

502
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,200
bars pulling back on falling volume

503
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,620
that's a great place to add

504
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,900
see a couple of bars pulling back

505
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,240
tiny little bars pulling back on low

506
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,260
volume

507
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,360
remember a low range bar should be

508
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,200
accompanied with by a low volume

509
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,500
pulling back tiny little bars

510
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
great place to add if you see a pullback

511
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,020
and Rising volume then the game can be

512
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,120
up no that's

513
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,840
a sign that we've got more likely

514
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,280
not a retracement but a change in trend

515
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,679
I'll show you some examples of that in a

516
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,940
second uh and uh this I took out of

517
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,480
wyckoff's 1929 course and I had the

518
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,940
artist again done in 89. I had the

519
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,480
artist put the color around it and if

520
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
you can see it broke and it broken

521
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,039
Rising volume

522
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,080
and then it pulled back on falling

523
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,039
volume

524
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,620
that's what a market should do

525
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,960
uh

526
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,620
in these if this is accumulation

527
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,280
you should see Rising volume in the

528
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,740
upswings and falling volume in the

529
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,460
downswings

530
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,559
we just the VectorVest people we've just

531
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,419
had an example of that on Bloomsbury

532
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,700
publishing where it went sideways for

533
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,159
the last year and an upswings good

534
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,320
volume and the downswings no volume at

535
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,659
all and Bloom 3 produced very good

536
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,059
results the other day and it flew up by

537
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,179
a third so the real world is something

538
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,860
quite different

539
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,299
that's an American Stock a new core and

540
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,220
it

541
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,020
uh

542
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,720
this I'll explain the setup in detail

543
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,760
but I think Dr Brooks did a good job of

544
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,159
talking around it it came back it traded

545
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,840
this double bottom

546
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,559
or uh as we'll see in a second of spring

547
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,320
uh pushing up and Rising volume

548
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,159
and at this turn here you can see that

549
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,840
it came down and took out the law and

550
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,940
reversed and above average volume that's

551
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,700
a very good sign uh there was a little

552
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,120
bit of uh trouble here I then went

553
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,640
sideways on medium volume and then

554
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,559
pushed back up again but that was the

555
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,520
Clincher for me uh this uh trade here on

556
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,059
the long side uh and that's uh so that's

557
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,900
that's new core uh

558
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,120
this is an intraday chart of the s p

559
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,580
again I'll explain the setup in some

560
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,620
detail

561
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,400
and we uh the market pulled back

562
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,179
uh to this low and then reversed and

563
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,820
then takes off and Rising volume and

564
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,799
then it goes sideways

565
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,000
on falling volume

566
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,380
that's a great place to add

567
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,320
as you can see this trend is now in a

568
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,700
little bit of danger because we could

569
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,200
get nowhere near the same volume uh

570
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,100
okay

571
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
but it has another go

572
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,600
has another go in there

573
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,940
that's been my best trade of the quarter

574
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,340
CF Industries these are the people that

575
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,280
are responsible in the UK for all of the

576
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,059
uh

577
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,419
CO2 in our cool drinks and beer and

578
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,039
there's a shortage of it again the

579
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,480
British government they've got a plant

580
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
up in the north north of England and the

581
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,620
government had to bail them out to keep

582
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,299
them here otherwise we would have run

583
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,360
out of CO2 uh and I at the moment

584
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
there's a shortage of mineral water

585
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,260
again or fizzy water again

586
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,500
as you can see we broke up on Rising

587
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,620
volume and we went sideways on falling

588
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,559
volume that's assert uh and then it

589
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,440
breaks and Rises on high volume that's

590
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,960
just a certain now there's a big Trend

591
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,419
there uh the fundamentals on VectorVest

592
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,860
were great

593
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,080
and it's in the throes of a long-term

594
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,900
Trend uh and Tom if you'll remember I

595
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,380
still use an 89-day moving average uh

596
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,360
for the trend uh 21 55 and 89 although I

597
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,039
don't put them on the charts that often

598
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,140
because I've been looking at them for so

599
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,020
long that I know where they are but uh

600
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,240
if you need a hand to define the trend

601
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,960
21 55 and 89 where they all cross I call

602
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,720
that a bow tie where they all cross okay

603
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,220
uh so uh now this thing moved up and

604
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,860
this is a bit of a worry here you see

605
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,039
look at that huge volume couldn't that's

606
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,360
where we were at the moment couldn't

607
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,100
close at the top I'll show you the rest

608
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,940
of the chart in a second uh uh so uh

609
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,760
that's an example of of trade entry I

610
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,559
took all the trades that I'm talking

611
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,260
about here I've taken them myself

612
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,039
and there's where we were uh remember

613
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,460
the the bar that closed uh halfway up

614
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,640
its range on big volume and it came back

615
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,100
after that

616
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,020
and then one thing that happened which

617
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,360
was a heads up that worried me is that

618
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,779
the price fell on Rising volume and that

619
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,100
was a heads up

620
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,980
I still took the Breakout

621
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,559
but on the last little bit of the trend

622
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,480
the price is rising but the volume

623
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,520
couldn't come to the party and then the

624
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,400
bloody thing fell out of bed

625
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,640
so that that last bit there was two bits

626
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,559
of evidence here uh they uh

627
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,059
maybe where's that pointer go to I

628
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:33,720
wonder

629
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,440
uh

630
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,720
the price fell and those red bars

631
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,000
and Rising volume that was saying this

632
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
trend looks complete uh then it breaks

633
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,360
and has a last hurray on falling volume

634
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,820
and then a gap Stone

635
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,860
so there was and that's what volumes

636
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,500
like folks it's a subtle signal

637
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,480
it's not something it took me a long

638
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,580
time to work this out I I was actually

639
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,400
taking action on volume very quickly

640
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
indeed but it's a subtle signal that the

641
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,340
trend is in a bit of trouble

642
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,440
okay and that's how it should be looked

643
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,679
upon

644
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,980
that's correct yeah

645
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,440
that's a warning so you need to be

646
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
careful when you see that you don't want

647
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
to be you can certainly hold the

648
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,900
positions you have you don't want to be

649
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,820
adding to positions in that environment

650
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,279
that's what I do so I want to add to

651
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,100
positions when I say price increasing

652
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,380
I'm pulling back or going sideways on

653
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,900
falling volume and then I'm reasonably

654
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,059
happy that it's going to break again

655
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:42,299
good place to add but when I see uh

656
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,419
evidence of non-validation

657
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,659
then uh then I get a little bit worried

658
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,940
about adding to the position

659
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,919
that's all I'm saying and it's

660
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,220
relatively subtle uh and uh that's why

661
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,220
many people give it a hard time uh

662
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,820
that's uh also in food sugar flour grain

663
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,400
Archer Daniels uh had a great trade on

664
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,820
that uh it uh runs up

665
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,520
on Rising volume and then it pulls back

666
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
and falling volume now here's what I

667
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,059
taught my son

668
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,820
the very first set about Autumn and

669
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,520
there's probably an a b equals CD uh

670
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,179
Market runs up as this is a stock it

671
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,760
should run up by 30 percent in six weeks

672
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,700
to three months right

673
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,179
should run up on Rising volume

674
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,860
and then it should pull back

675
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,200
enter some form of consolidation

676
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,000
triangle flag rectangle

677
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,980
by the Breakout

678
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,580
that's it tight little stop loss try and

679
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,320
make uh three times as much as you risk

680
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,960
and we find he find by doing that that

681
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
the the share would run from for hard

682
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,360
after the if it worked it would run hard

683
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,080
after the breakout uh for five days

684
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,840
let it run for five days get your stop

685
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,240
to entry

686
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,880
and then do your best to let it run uh

687
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,240
until a b equals CD

688
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,860
that's the set that's the only thing he

689
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,539
does he's got 50 million pounds under

690
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,620
management

691
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,440
it's the only thing he does

692
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,059
so that's that runs up

693
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,000
needs to move up by 30 percent let it go

694
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,100
sideways let it break again

695
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,960
um

696
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,260
this is ccj folks and it's a great

697
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,240
example the share hasn't done much yet

698
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,480
for me but I it's setting uh this is a

699
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
uranium stock and you can see clear

700
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,260
accumulation here uh big bar up out of

701
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,919
that Gap and then uh as you can see it

702
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,220
good volume there but uh a lot of

703
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,260
selling volume it then pulls back goes

704
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,799
side pulls back on falling volume runs

705
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,860
again on big volume runs again on big

706
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,440
volume runs again on big volume it's not

707
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,899
going sideways and falling volume you

708
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,880
can't do that with that level of

709
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,820
certainty without volume analysis in any

710
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,200
market and any time frame

711
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,760
the relationship between price and

712
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,080
volume tells you who's running the

713
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,640
market whether the Bulls are running a

714
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,320
market where the Bears are running a

715
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,100
market

716
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,919
and I'm I'm more than happy to admit on

717
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,020
a five minute chart it gets very noisy

718
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,260
indeed and uh much much more difficult

719
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,919
on a daily chart or an early chart uh so

720
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,799
uh and that's what I teach at VectorVest

721
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,620
and I do a webcast on blue in the face

722
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,159
on that sort of stuff uh again that's a

723
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,899
stock that that's a trade that I took a

724
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,120
little while back as my standard trade

725
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
folks it moves up and Rising volume goes

726
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,520
sideways and falling boom then it goes

727
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,520
again it couldn't be simpler uh

728
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,100
I love these patterns and this is Lucy

729
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,960
Mike's uh

730
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,779
that run up must be 30 in the share

731
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,520
price from the last base

732
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,860
right uh

733
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,919
that should take place in uh six weeks

734
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,020
to three months that thirty percent it

735
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,659
then pulls back into this case a flag

736
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,559
and then it breaks again uh and he then

737
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,340
takes a b equals you know what CD for a

738
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,279
Target that's a setup now the difference

739
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,220
between what I what I the difference

740
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,840
between

741
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,720
what's been presented so far and what

742
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm trying to motivate is that you

743
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,159
should see a noticeable increase in

744
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,679
volume in a b

745
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,500
and a noticeable decrease in volume in

746
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,520
BC

747
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,799
to give you the strength

748
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,500
for it to go again no that's easy in the

749
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,240
stock market it's easy

750
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,100
and probably volume is much more

751
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,520
reliable in the stock market uh

752
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,559
but you can see it in all markets in all

753
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,320
time frames and that's the basis of the

754
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,019
white golf work and that's the only

755
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,880
thing that Mike doesn't say that's the

756
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,159
only thing he does

757
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,880
and uh he does it very well doesn't look

758
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,659
at anything else

759
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,720
now that's I own the share uh it's told

760
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,059
to Gala it used to be called Amco it's

761
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,480
not together resources and this is an

762
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,860
interesting one you can see the little

763
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,100
flag here this is it went up by 30 it

764
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,500
went from four to six not by fifty

765
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,340
percent in that run then go sideways

766
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,059
now it moves up that last bar was in

767
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,059
good volume and then we've got these two

768
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,679
red bars

769
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,799
and the red bars as you can see uh

770
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,440
produced very very little results we had

771
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,559
uh big volume but they were down bars so

772
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,080
lots and lots of volume going in but the

773
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,179
market couldn't get down that's what

774
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,080
Wyckoff called bag holding uh then go

775
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,480
sideways and then it breaks up and big

776
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,060
volume that's the classic trade folks

777
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,980
that's just classic that's a beauty that

778
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,780
share is going from three pounds four

779
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,000
that was listed at three pounds it's

780
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,980
gone from three points to nine pounds

781
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,899
now in uh

782
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,099
what

783
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,080
uh nine months uh if that it was listed

784
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,119
anglo-american had to get rid of it when

785
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,918
that conference was on up in Scotland

786
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,960
you remember the cop conference up in

787
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Scotland it's called they had to get rid

788
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,300
of it and they listed it in a fortnight

789
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,899
uh and uh then all of a sudden coal goes

790
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,199
from the Antichrist itself now to

791
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,599
something that people need to keep the

792
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,920
lights on uh so uh that's uh quite a

793
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,740
simple little trade uh and uh

794
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,300
that's

795
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,760
a pump for my VectorVest program that's

796
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,859
earnings per share that's the VectorVest

797
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,260
valuation of the share and those of you

798
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,700
that are technicians all of you are

799
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,859
technicians you should see the classic

800
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,440
cup and handle pattern before that as

801
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,900
well but at the end I only traded the

802
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,640
flag pattern uh

803
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,440
and this back in the day that Zoom

804
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,560
that's one of my best trades uh that's

805
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,900
back in the day it's given all this all

806
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,300
up again uh there's my moving averages

807
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,820
that's earnings per share

808
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,480
flying up on Zoom uh we had this big run

809
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,579
up the gap on big volume

810
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,859
and then it goes sideways I didn't trade

811
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,740
that first bit and then it rises again

812
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,380
on Rising volume and now it pulls back

813
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,660
on falling volume and then away it goes

814
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,240
again and it flew from there so that's a

815
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,480
classic setup folks uh uh and they're

816
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,740
the two that's 21 and 55 and it's it was

817
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,839
at that stage significantly undervalued

818
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,440
by VectorVest and that's a very simple

819
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,400
way to make a living uh finding those uh

820
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,140
and that is Tesla is that a flag setting

821
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,520
up in Tesla

822
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,920
I'll be trading it

823
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,900
push-up I don't know what's going to

824
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,000
happen next push-up happened and Rising

825
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,940
volume get a couple of see this get a

826
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,859
couple of small little bars on average

827
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,140
volume that's good and now it's going

828
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,180
sideways on falling volume that's going

829
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,440
again

830
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,079
let me take Glory by association can I

831
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,099
take this Hemingway

832
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,300
he said he that he liked to take Glory

833
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,520
by association that was one of his

834
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,579
Expressions uh my two sons went to the

835
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,099
same school as Elon Musk how's that

836
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,480
I'm taking Glory by association so I I

837
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,260
think that that's going to go uh uh so

838
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,540
the bear Market folks as the Irish

839
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,859
should say is the same only different

840
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,440
whereas that man I spoke Kieran

841
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,339
he's going home I think

842
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:18,839
the price and the bear Market the price

843
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,300
should fall and the volume should rise

844
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,420
and then we get a rally on falling

845
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,220
volume and that's where you want to

846
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,560
short it now that's one of the most

847
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,260
reliable trades in the world if you're

848
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,020
gonna trendone and a rally on falling

849
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,520
volume that's the only time I would

850
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,740
consider shorting a stock

851
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,560
Rally's on falling volume and the last

852
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,420
two bars you'll find will be really

853
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,000
narrow range bars before it changes its

854
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,640
mind again and then it should fall on

855
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,160
Rising volume there's no non-validation

856
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,880
there again this comes out of wake UPS

857
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,060
1929 course or 28 course a break on

858
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,380
Rising volume

859
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,900
and then a rally on falling volume then

860
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,680
it goes down again on Rising volume uh

861
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,359
now I was

862
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,359
I remember yeah Friday uh way back on

863
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,400
Friday uh I was short the uh s p x but

864
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,560
that's the spider and I like the volume

865
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,280
figures on the spider much much better

866
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,460
uh and you can see a way back here

867
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,700
uh in the first wave darn look at this

868
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,339
huge print here at that low and you can

869
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,859
see that uh that's an end-of-day chart

870
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,800
as well you can see that this Market in

871
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,380
fact uh opened went right down I'm

872
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,820
closed huge huge bar huge huge reversal

873
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,280
enormous demand at that level uh we

874
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,140
actually get the same thing here it

875
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,660
takes out the level huge now these are

876
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,480
the two biggest volume days uh for the

877
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,760
last five years on the spider at that

878
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,780
level

879
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,339
uh and then it runs and as it runs up

880
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,380
over the last week or two the last 10

881
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,320
days it's run up and falling volume and

882
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,060
that's why I was looking for any reason

883
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,220
to short the bugger up there on Thursday

884
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,380
or Friday on Wednesday my first trade

885
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,680
was uh was two the stop was too tight I

886
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,079
got stopped out but I made it all back

887
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
plus on uh Thursday and Friday but nice

888
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,960
I'll show you the trade in a second so I

889
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,820
run up and falling volume like that

890
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,820
folks uh that's a heads up and you don't

891
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,160
want to react to the darn thing straight

892
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,640
away you need it clearly a a a a signal

893
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
from Price action

894
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,560
but uh it's a heads up and that that's

895
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,400
the uh uh that's the uh

896
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,240
fresh that's the cash Market uh uh chart

897
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,420
that was my attempt on uh Wednesday I

898
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,420
think I was a 15 minute chart it broke

899
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,240
down and Rising volume at the open

900
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,940
and I always like to watch the open bar

901
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,640
on a 15-minute chart there's always a

902
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,859
lot of volume obviously it just has

903
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:05,520
opened and uh just see what the first 15

904
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,300
minute bar looks like and that one in

905
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,960
fact couldn't uh it went right up and it

906
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,760
couldn't stay up there it was certainly

907
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,859
Supply came in up there so that was the

908
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,839
basis of my trade and then all of a

909
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,240
sudden it rallied on falling volume and

910
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,359
I thought I was quid Zen

911
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:28,140
but no alas alas there was noise up

912
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,119
there and I got stopped a very small

913
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,320
loss but I I was quite I I I thought

914
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,640
that maybe that was going to be a big

915
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,040
one I had to wait for the next day again

916
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,920
the same sort of thing uh on the stock

917
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,680
market I want to see a 30 fall I want to

918
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,180
see a rally

919
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,800
and that's pretty much what we had on

920
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,980
Friday on the S P 500 and then I want to

921
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,020
see it fall again and you've guessed it

922
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,839
a b equals CD but rally down should be

923
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,579
on Rising volume

924
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,920
sorry the move down should be in Rising

925
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,200
volume the rally should be unfalling

926
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,540
volume and that's one of the most

927
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,700
certain trades that you can have and

928
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,260
there was an old fella out there called

929
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,480
Cohen and he had a company in New York

930
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,240
City called chartcraft and he was one of

931
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,240
the original Founders after Wyckoff on

932
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,000
point and figure charting and I met his

933
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,980
grandson some years back a guy called

934
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,579
David Cohen and his granddad had made

935
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,859
this conclusion that markets are

936
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,800
significantly more predictable on the

937
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,680
downside than they are on the upside and

938
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,140
as old as Grandad had proven that over

939
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,180
many many years have you met old man

940
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,320
Cohen chart craft

941
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,000
yeah chart craft in New York City is run

942
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,579
by David Cohen the original chaps uh

943
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,480
grandson first class fellow so

944
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,579
you don't have to make it complex you

945
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,140
know what and I don't mean any

946
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,940
disservice to people who didn't grow up

947
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,760
my ex-wife told me once upon a time that

948
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,060
I complicate The Lord's Prayer uh so I

949
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,400
can make life very complicated for me

950
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,260
and I mean no

951
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,020
harm to anybody that wasn't dragged up

952
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,560
the same way as myself uh but I I tend I

953
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,000
can't make things far far more

954
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,260
complicated than they are uh I for a

955
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,079
high probability trade I want to see

956
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,900
evidence of a trend up or down I want to

957
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,940
see then and a bear case I want to see a

958
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,460
rally on falling volume

959
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,380
and then I want to sell the hell out of

960
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,320
it simple as that uh tight stop try and

961
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,420
make three times as much when I'm right

962
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,420
as I am when I'm wrong uh I've got some

963
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,359
more examples that's a a classic short

964
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,020
that's JD Sports it's a High Street uh

965
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,720
sports shop uh this is a while back

966
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,599
folks but it's just a classic one I

967
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,700
rarely short in stocks I'm happier

968
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,460
shorting the index but we can see this

969
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,099
big print on the downside

970
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,619
and then it rallies on falling volume

971
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,900
can't get up at all and then it falls

972
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,300
out of bed again uh so uh this one is a

973
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,700
a stock that I'd held I was out of it

974
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,579
well before this I didn't short it but

975
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,220
you can see that this is no rallying and

976
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,339
this flag this thing uh Rising wedge or

977
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,339
uh three drives pattern that Larry talks

978
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,880
about uh and as you can see uh right at

979
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,980
the Apex of that there's just nothing

980
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,220
there at all nothing apart from right

981
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,319
rats and mice and then it fell through

982
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,440
the bloody floor so uh and again I

983
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,960
guarantee if you do an a b equals CD

984
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,180
you'll find the target pretty much

985
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,940
all right so uh uh

986
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,220
we made a heap of money at VectorVest on

987
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,440
this one last year I mean a heap of

988
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,560
money we were in it from these lows and

989
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,140
then I added again uh when I got that

990
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,599
breakout on huge volume that's always a

991
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,740
great sign a big big bar on huge volume

992
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,220
uh and uh then got out of it up there

993
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,460
then this you see this Rose for a couple

994
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,160
of weeks and volume on that week pretty

995
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,920
much zero that's a huge non-validation

996
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,740
and then we get the outside bar and the

997
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,140
bloody thing falls out of bed uh so and

998
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,200
it's still falling out of bed uh

999
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,960
this is on an hourly chart

1000
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,800
price rising and falling volume uh and

1001
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,540
that's and then it fellow to bed again

1002
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,440
that's uh ages old I think uh I did that

1003
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,140
these for Tom's last seminar

1004
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,839
so let let me go on to my final little

1005
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,319
bit it's according to five uh and

1006
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,500
four years and before I met you Tom I

1007
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,680
had a little the book had fallen apart

1008
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,220
uh sorry sir

1009
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,500
remote client to take that shot than you

1010
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,619
would uh follow up no I would take but I

1011
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,900
will take both and I'm probably better

1012
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,760
on the long side in the stock market

1013
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,920
okay uh happier on the long side uh

1014
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,160
I I rarely short stocks themselves I'm

1015
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,980
more than happy to short the index but

1016
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,400
uh if you want to short the stock market

1017
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,800
uh a rally on falling volume in a

1018
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,599
downtrend in other words an a b equals

1019
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,060
CD Down uh where the a b c

1020
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,780
c b c is on falling volume that's As

1021
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,540
Good As It Gets in this line of work in

1022
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,240
my humble opinion it's a more reliable

1023
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,160
trade than the long trade yeah

1024
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,020
okay more reliable yes sir

1025
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,619
I can't hear you sir

1026
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:00,619
uh that is uh Wall Street yeah

1027
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:07,740
uh I I I I I took a e-signal volume uh

1028
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,240
for years

1029
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,400
uh uh um and uh from the index yes

1030
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,839
from the Futures Market yeah that's

1031
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,000
where they get it from I took uh

1032
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
e-signal volume for up years and then I

1033
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,099
found out that the trading view volume

1034
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,079
was exactly the same as the e-signal

1035
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,000
volume so I stopped trading I stopped

1036
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,780
e-signal okay

1037
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,980
on trading View

1038
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,319
you've got it yeah

1039
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,599
yes that's correct yeah that's where

1040
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,900
they get it from yeah uh so uh it's

1041
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,740
exactly the same I tried it forever and

1042
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,520
e-signal is a temperamental sword uh

1043
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,160
foreign

1044
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,200
so this little book of wyckoffs it fell

1045
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,359
apart in my briefcase

1046
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,460
and he said so beautifully

1047
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,220
that you can make a living by trading

1048
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,260
Springs and up for us training these

1049
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,119
setups represent the essence of My

1050
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,880
Method it involves establishing trades

1051
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,460
at the danger point where the risk is

1052
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,079
least in the profit potential is

1053
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,099
greatest

1054
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,520
and schematically that's how I've drawn

1055
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,800
these things so ah

1056
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,079
I trade most of them with the trend

1057
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,880
although you can't pick bottoms with

1058
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,819
them but I don't need to I I'm not

1059
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,520
hungry enough to do that I'm looking for

1060
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,260
Market to come up

1061
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,780
to find resistance

1062
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,619
to pull back and kiss that resistance to

1063
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,560
push up again and then come back and

1064
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,980
clip that low and run now it can be the

1065
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,960
same as a gartly pattern but it doesn't

1066
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,359
have to be it just needs to get its nose

1067
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,440
down below that low

1068
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,280
similarly enough thrust is a it finds

1069
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,440
support

1070
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,440
or demand and wyckoff's language a

1071
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,319
couple of times it then breaks goes up

1072
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:04,740
kisses comes down and then goes up and

1073
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,319
takes the old top boat by a tick or two

1074
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,800
and that's called an up thrust

1075
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,140
and there's the theoretical part of it

1076
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,599
uh

1077
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,480
you can trade it with a trend or you can

1078
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,339
try and pick bottoms with it I only

1079
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,760
trade it with the trend now when it

1080
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,859
breaks this little bit at the bottom Mr

1081
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,740
gam called Lost motion

1082
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,520
now when it breaks up

1083
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,980
40 percent of the time it comes back and

1084
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,339
kisses the level 40 percent of the time

1085
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,060
sixty percent of the time it goes

1086
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,099
so forty percent of the time you get a

1087
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:48,060
test now there is uh uh a classic this

1088
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,859
is on Platinum and That's a classic uh

1089
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:56,460
uh Wyckoff uh spring technique we've got

1090
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,780
resistance

1091
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,900
it comes back to here

1092
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,520
runs up

1093
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,280
to here and this bar should this

1094
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,680
reversal bar should occur on Rising

1095
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,880
volume

1096
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,740
and I I would be a buyer on there

1097
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,500
at the next open stop loss under here

1098
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,359
and you can see how I came back and

1099
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,000
kissed you see that forty percent of the

1100
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,339
time it does that it'll come back and

1101
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:24,960
kiss that level

1102
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,359
uh some people say that you should in

1103
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,260
fact buy the test and of course that

1104
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,540
means that you miss the 60 that don't

1105
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,560
test

1106
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,700
40 percent of them test uh uh I tend to

1107
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,260
get in on a close above uh the level

1108
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,780
uh you can buy the level if you want but

1109
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,339
uh that was a particularly good one

1110
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:50,819
because this is an outside bar and you

1111
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:51,720
know what

1112
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,119
I know I'm a bit of a one-track pony but

1113
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,579
I don't do much more than that and I get

1114
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,140
enough trades around the market to keep

1115
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,040
me well uh well fed and watered by doing

1116
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,859
that now

1117
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,839
this is an example that's setting up

1118
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,280
that I'm going to be talking to the

1119
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,540
VectorVest people about tomorrow

1120
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,140
afternoon uh this is gold fields

1121
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,780
uh and you can see there's run up on

1122
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,300
Rising volume and now it's pulling back

1123
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,520
on falling volume hasn't shown a great

1124
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,819
deal of volume on the breakout as yet

1125
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:26,339
but it came down and I like this bar

1126
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,240
because it reversed on uh pretty much

1127
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,280
average volume bit more would have been

1128
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,000
better but uh that to me is a classic

1129
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,640
white golf spring and that's something

1130
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
that I should be personally Trading

1131
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,740
uh

1132
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,859
okay that's gold Fields that's the 21

1133
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,619
moving average if you put the 55 on

1134
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,839
there the 20 ones above the 55s above

1135
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,240
the 89 and that means the trends intact

1136
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,339
and unvective S the fundamentals are

1137
00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:00,359
great uh uh there uh I think we looked

1138
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,160
at these on Friday

1139
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,800
this is last week

1140
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,980
on the S P that's a one hour chart which

1141
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,960
is where I try and look for most of my

1142
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,420
trades because when that's that's not

1143
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,420
called a spring for nothing folks

1144
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,460
when it if you sit and wait for them

1145
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,839
you're going to be very happy because

1146
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,000
they spring

1147
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,880
and they go like the clappers

1148
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,180
and you're not sitting there and angst

1149
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,579
they either go like the clappers or they

1150
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,440
don't go at all there's nothing worse

1151
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,940
than setting in a trade that's going

1152
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,579
bloody well nowhere remember the tail

1153
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,400
must never Wag the Dog

1154
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,099
you're there to make some money

1155
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,140
to buy resources

1156
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,740
it's the only thing that life's about

1157
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,099
maybe the odd Border Collie

1158
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,319
a border collie is the price of a good

1159
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,359
car do you knew that

1160
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,460
twenty thousand pounds for a decent

1161
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,839
Border Collie

1162
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,400
dog

1163
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,700
twenty thousand pounds

1164
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,819
there's a cue there's for a decent

1165
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,740
well-bred border collie you're gonna

1166
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,020
have to put your name in and wait for

1167
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,859
six to nine months

1168
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,020
they're they're they're they're they're

1169
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,200
worth waiting for uh so uh

1170
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,060
[Applause]

1171
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,900
you're not okay all right all right okay

1172
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,720
uh there's nothing more uh

1173
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,660
Pleasant than a dog uh that's the one

1174
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,099
thing I haven't got a dog at the moment

1175
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,800
but it's the one never I'm never gonna

1176
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,720
have a wife again but I'm gonna have a

1177
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,140
dog ah okay

1178
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,480
I mean I don't mean that in any nasty

1179
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,400
way at all

1180
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,700
uh but uh and I've been pricing dogs and

1181
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,599
that's why I know exactly uh the price

1182
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:59,520
uh for a decent border collie yeah and

1183
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,140
they're people scrumming over them at

1184
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,140
twenty thousand pounds uh so here's the

1185
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,839
we've got resistance folks and the damn

1186
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:09,059
thing goes up can't get up there and

1187
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:11,819
then it pulls back and kisses that and

1188
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,339
then it reverses and that's it there's

1189
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,440
nothing more to it than that

1190
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,599
the white Gulf Spring and then the

1191
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,119
bloody thing Springs

1192
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,260
now this is another one

1193
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,880
maybe some people would have got in

1194
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,339
there and that happened in the morning

1195
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,460
about 10 o'clock I didn't take that one

1196
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,400
but that's at the open and uh it moves

1197
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,079
up here and then it comes back and you

1198
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,960
see the test there's the level and it

1199
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,839
comes up comes back Tess and then goes

1200
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,180
again I got in on that one after the

1201
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,500
test

1202
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,260
now where are you going to get out well

1203
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,140
you can use Larry a b equals CD that'll

1204
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,160
be perfect

1205
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,079
absolutely perfect or you can use a a

1206
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:59,940
1.618 extension of the pullback of your

1207
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,520
Fibonacci fan but you've heard Larry

1208
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,359
yesterday uh and speaking from the

1209
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,980
bottom of his heart about the power of

1210
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,140
the ab equals CD so that's a good place

1211
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,900
to be looking for a Target where a b

1212
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,680
equals CD okay

1213
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,740
sir what is the lowest time frame you

1214
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,260
would use volume as an indicator to make

1215
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,960
a decision

1216
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,460
you can use it right down to a five

1217
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,740
minute chart that become you're gonna I

1218
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,720
would suggest that to get your

1219
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,780
to get your interpretation correct that

1220
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,520
you would look at a gnarly chart for the

1221
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,319
next week or two until you get the feel

1222
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,180
of it but by all means you can look at

1223
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,280
but works pretty well in a 15-minute

1224
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,059
chart

1225
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,380
okay uh uh but it's noisier in a five

1226
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,359
minute chart and probably more it's like

1227
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:51,420
any any form of stats the more

1228
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,940
the more observations you have the more

1229
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,119
accurate they become so on a longer time

1230
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,760
frame The Edge effects get canceled out

1231
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,920
especially in this in any Market people

1232
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,660
buy and share things for no other reason

1233
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,300
for for example your granny dies and

1234
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,980
leaves you a quarter of a million pounds

1235
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,960
you go out and buy stocks you've bought

1236
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,180
stocks for no other reason than your

1237
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,180
granny left you the money and and

1238
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,400
all of a sudden you run up gambling

1239
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,819
debts to 250 000 pounds and you've got

1240
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,500
to go out and sell stocks to pay the

1241
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,960
gambling debt uh there's nothing to do

1242
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,520
with the stocks themselves there's all

1243
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,040
sorts of edge effects in there all sorts

1244
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,020
of noise in there people buy and sell

1245
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,180
things for all sorts of of reasons that

1246
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,859
have got nothing to do with the actual

1247
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,740
instrument itself so the longer the time

1248
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,420
frame the more reliable start with an

1249
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,579
hourly chart

1250
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:43,200
or even better still start with the

1251
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,020
daily chart and work your way down if

1252
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,059
you're trading the indices keep your eye

1253
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,000
on the spider the Spy the volume on the

1254
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,800
spiders are real good leading indicator

1255
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,859
for any other index in the world uh so

1256
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:57,720
that's two good examples that's last

1257
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,819
week I haven't Cherry Picked them but

1258
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,460
they do come like London taxis folks you

1259
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,280
know you you get six and you stand there

1260
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,380
for hours in the rain and then six taxis

1261
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,300
come at once all right that's just the

1262
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,559
way it is uh so uh let's go a little bit

1263
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,140
further and then I promise I'll let you

1264
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,160
all

1265
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,140
that's

1266
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,839
I think that's the same

1267
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,940
one that's a Spring Beauty down there

1268
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,119
now this one there's no shoulder I took

1269
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,400
it in a way it didn't work that well I

1270
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,220
but it worked finally but I I got out of

1271
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,319
it didn't get back in here but that's

1272
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,540
textbook there's the shoulder resistance

1273
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,119
here there's no shoulder and those are

1274
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,800
always dodgier

1275
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,500
I like that I like to see a resistance

1276
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,099
support support and the way it ran this

1277
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,260
low that's a clear stop running exercise

1278
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,040
look at the spring just a beauty

1279
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:57,319
absolute Beauty uh so uh

1280
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,720
that's a five minute chart Works in all

1281
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,220
time frames

1282
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,880
uh

1283
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,440
that's another five minute chart worked

1284
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,420
perfectly there

1285
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,140
uh

1286
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,200
maybe a bit more agricultural but not

1287
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,280
bad

1288
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:23,700
down here on that's in the Dow Jones uh

1289
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,300
there's another one uh came back once

1290
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,619
because right there and that's at the

1291
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,960
open they frequently happen in the first

1292
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,220
hour

1293
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,559
a couple of hours where it runs up comes

1294
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,079
back once has a go and then comes down I

1295
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,940
think Dr Brooks showed a couple of

1296
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,619
examples this morning where that

1297
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,240
happened this morning he was I don't

1298
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,579
know two or three times but I'm I'm more

1299
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:46,800
than happy to wait for the spring okay

1300
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,960
uh

1301
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,180
and sometimes of course they just go and

1302
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,520
you miss it that one's good down here

1303
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,380
but the second one I was waiting for it

1304
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,040
I remember Vivid I just kept on going uh

1305
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,180
that is another five minute chart uh

1306
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,460
that was a judgment call folks because

1307
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,880
it actually didn't take out this low so

1308
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,220
it wasn't everything else was perfect

1309
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,920
and we could see the volume shooting up

1310
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,220
here on this first bar and I took the

1311
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,380
trade anyway but maybe I was

1312
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,000
scared of missing out I'm more than

1313
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
happy to admit that uh

1314
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,760
and now the opposite is the upfrush

1315
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,059
that's the schematic of the up thrust uh

1316
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:32,460
and uh that's a good example I think

1317
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,579
that's in Forex uh their support comes

1318
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,940
up once and goes right up and then you

1319
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,880
can see the capitulation at the top huge

1320
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,740
amount of Supply coming in at that old

1321
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,140
top we chart one of those what's it

1322
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,020
called shooting stars and then uh it

1323
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,680
falls and Falls like a stone uh

1324
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,980
that's that's gold the other day now the

1325
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,200
VectorVest people I was trading this

1326
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,420
last Monday afternoon if you remember in

1327
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,559
the uh 1 30 session uh and

1328
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,339
that was I got in underneath that low

1329
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:10,619
and I had that order I put the order in

1330
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:13,619
before I went to bed on Sunday night and

1331
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:17,599
uh I got that taken out

1332
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,119
Larry when you talk about pets

1333
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,920
it's good man it's good it's good it's

1334
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,400
good at one stage I had I was trading

1335
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,260
the poem to get the dollar against the

1336
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,240
Yen and I had one of those projectors

1337
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,960
and I had the dollar against the Yen

1338
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,700
projected against the wall

1339
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,520
on the bedroom so I could wake up in the

1340
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,780
middle of the night and have a look I

1341
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,299
was much more I was much Keener I was

1342
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:50,220
much Keener in those days and maybe

1343
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,180
that's why the wife left but

1344
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,359
I had to I was much hungrier on those

1345
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm 66 folks and I'm I'm I don't need

1346
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,640
that much money uh everything that I

1347
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,220
used to spend money on I've given up so

1348
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,599
um uh

1349
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,819
I finally had to get rid of the

1350
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:11,460
projector because the Border Collie that

1351
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,160
I had uh she stayed around after the

1352
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,380
wife left and the border of Cali would

1353
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,380
bark at this bark at the wall during the

1354
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,819
night because it was interfering with

1355
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,040
her Slumber so I had to finally get rid

1356
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,780
of that ah so this was last week uh and

1357
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,020
I think that this is an AB equal CD here

1358
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,359
in fact I'm sure it is and I think it's

1359
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,720
a 38 Protestant as well I don't know uh

1360
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,540
but it went up took out that top and

1361
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,220
then It reversed it tried to get down

1362
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,180
rallies and then it broke that level on

1363
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,180
uh first first well in the first four

1364
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,760
hour bar of Monday and then it goes back

1365
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,920
in tests in fact my very words to the

1366
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,480
VectorVest people last Monday afternoon

1367
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,940
I hope that the test is over

1368
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,960
okay and then uh it uh fell and fell

1369
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,260
very nicely indeed until I did this uh

1370
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,720
and then when I yeah it stopped at this

1371
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,420
low on big big volume it was demand came

1372
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,480
in at the low uh and I'm the tricks in

1373
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,240
between now and on gold itself

1374
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,420
that low that we see here right that

1375
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,020
1900 there's a big high on the daily

1376
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,559
chart six weeks ago so I thought maybe

1377
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:27,799
gold was going to go back to about 1850

1378
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:31,500
uh but we've now seen very determined

1379
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,980
support at the 1900 level in Gold so uh

1380
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,819
we shall see what happens tomorrow uh

1381
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,559
that let's see what that that's that's

1382
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,859
uh glencore that's uh up thrust on

1383
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:47,339
glencore uh frequently folks you'll find

1384
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:49,079
that these things get run in the news

1385
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,599
and that I don't know what the news was

1386
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,940
there but it went right up and clipped

1387
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,099
the high and then reversed again so

1388
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:00,180
that's news trading and likes I I avoid

1389
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,000
it like the plague uh

1390
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,020
and uh

1391
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,940
that is another up thrust and I'm

1392
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,700
finished now but I've got

1393
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,119
I want to look at uh trading view I

1394
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,640
think I've got it open for the that was

1395
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,079
Friday

1396
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,460
and

1397
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,079
I was in

1398
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,299
uh this trade I was looking for any

1399
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:27,660
reason to short it and I shorted it on

1400
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,920
that bar

1401
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,339
where it fell on Rising volume and had

1402
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,619
broke there's a trend line there as well

1403
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:37,020
uh I was looking for any reason to short

1404
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,359
it and I know that's not good to talk at

1405
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,260
a seminar but uh uh that's because at

1406
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,960
the 4-6 level we had that big up thrust

1407
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,640
on The Daily charts I was looking for

1408
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,059
any reason to short it and as it broke

1409
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:51,780
down

1410
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,079
uh on big big volume that was my reason

1411
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,819
to short it then went back and tried to

1412
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:00,299
test and then it fell out of bed uh and

1413
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,880
I held it overnight

1414
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,339
and

1415
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,559
I should have

1416
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,740
there's another little spring here

1417
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,839
sorry up thrust

1418
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:16,079
there's no shoulder but it does this and

1419
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,020
it's in a b equals CD as well and it

1420
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,079
does this and uh I should have added to

1421
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,480
that position here I didn't because I

1422
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,540
was I was in fact on my way I was

1423
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,900
wandering around outside uh because you

1424
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,780
guys moved here uh without letting me

1425
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,740
know uh now uh the Target in this and I

1426
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,660
took profits on this when I was sitting

1427
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,339
up there uh uh listening uh uh and I I

1428
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:47,640
if you draw a fib extension there's an

1429
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,440
old high here on the chart there's a

1430
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,059
range here uh and uh as you can see I I

1431
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,359
always draw a fib uh

1432
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,079
and extend from there to there and

1433
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,700
looking for that Target and I took

1434
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,220
profits at four five one five on that

1435
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,680
which was the construction that I had in

1436
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,260
place and then all of a sudden we got to

1437
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,540
move up into the close I think that on

1438
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,540
the indices folks we've had five waves

1439
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:20,339
down uh and five waves down as uh is an

1440
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:22,740
Impulse wave I think now that we've got

1441
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,619
uh probably uh a bit of a correction to

1442
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:27,480
go that'll take us up for two or three

1443
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,940
days and then we'll see what happens we

1444
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,740
really will see what happens it doesn't

1445
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,220
matter my count on the doe is that that

1446
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,740
high at four six naught naught was a

1447
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,140
wave five of wave three and what we're

1448
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,079
in now is a week four and uh We've now

1449
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,940
got away five to come so I think there's

1450
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,980
another new hide that could take us up

1451
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,680
into May in the stock indices and then

1452
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,020
we'll see what happens you've all read

1453
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,380
about the two and the ten inverted there

1454
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,960
was a PMI report on Friday one did that

1455
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,420
come in that does anybody know

1456
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,480
the uh my looking at this generally for

1457
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,559
many years the uh the last PMI the the

1458
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,920
210 inverting invariably forecast a

1459
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,660
recession but forecast a recession about

1460
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,720
six months out uh uh the PMI the last

1461
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,319
PMI was 60 and PMI industry was 61. so

1462
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:21,839
if you get a PMI coming down under 50

1463
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,440
plus the 210 becoming inverted then

1464
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,319
that's a much more serious signal so as

1465
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,900
long as that PMI sits up there at about

1466
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,420
60 level uh

1467
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,059
I think we can get a more upside there's

1468
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,220
no bears there's people are still too

1469
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,400
bearish so I think that the last bear

1470
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,960
needs to

1471
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,799
be silenced before it goes down uh so

1472
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,900
I'm still optimistic but I'm overly

1473
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,720
optimistic uh folks that's me finished

1474
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,160
