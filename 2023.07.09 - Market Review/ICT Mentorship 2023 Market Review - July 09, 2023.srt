1
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,019
all right folks welcome back this is a

2
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,359
market review for

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,740
July 9th 2023.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,480
we're looking at the dollar Index is our

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,219
weekly chart here

6
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,219
and I'll take you into

7
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,399
this candle here mean threshold that up

8
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,660
close candle

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,219
bearish water block you can see we

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,260
worked up into that level here several

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,340
weeks ago

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,500
uh you've known about this

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,120
fair value Gap here

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
and we have a liquidity pool

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,239
right here for sell side liquidity so

16
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,460
we're in a bit of a trading range so far

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,480
we've had

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
multiple instances of trying to get

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
above this imbalance

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,220
at both times we've had Anonymous to do

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,119
that

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,760
very short term sell side liquidity pool

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,020
here

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,060
a lot more

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,520
resting below here so it'll be

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,860
interesting to see how we open and trade

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,900
this week coming up

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,580
um I'm favoring

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,500
at least they run below this low and how

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,119
we trade there does it accelerate if it

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,439
does then obviously we'll be looking for

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,960
it to reach below here for the sell side

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,159
if we trade below it here and then

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,259
reject and then we may stay inside of

35
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,420
this range right in here a little bit

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,579
longer

37
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,020
all right so here's the daily chart on

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,640
dollar Index you can see again how we've

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,460
worked up into that weekly mean

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,799
threshold of the bear shorter block

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
this shaded area doesn't look as clean

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,780
you'll notice the weekly fair value you

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,240
got before we drop down into the daily

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
chart as you've noticed up here

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
it doesn't look like a fair value gap on

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,700
the daily chart that's why you have to

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
take your higher time frame PD arrays

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,479
and transpose them into the lower time

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,280
frames I'm having daily fair value Gap

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,420
here

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,160
and we see we worked into that level

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,060
there

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
and now we had a really nice sell-off

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
last Friday

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,239
um

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:49,120
this down close candle right here
1.I'm watching how we open on Sunday 
2.and we trade on Monday 
because we have this potential OB
we might again want to return back up into this area right in here
and the reason why I'm saying that is because we also have a -high -low -higher high which is a BRK 
so it may want to come back up into this area here 
and this entire down enclosed candle is the -BRK 
so we have to be mindful of that going forward

00:02:50,099 --> 00:03:06,700
so you know gone to my head 
I favor a run below this low 
and how we do? if at all trade below that low 
if it accelerates then all this liquidity in here should be a likely draw longer term

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,260
hourly chart one dollar Index here's

78
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,239
that Weekly fair value Gap year

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,239
and I have the holiday fourth July

80
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,099
highlighted here

81
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,680
opening price

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,200
on Monday New York midnight opening

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,700
price

84
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,340
so we can see the weekly power three

85
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,560
which is the open

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,319
if we were looking for shorts obviously

87
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,560
you want to see it rally higher

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,659
the Thursday which is what I mentioned

89
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,599
in commentary earlier in the week that

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
they would be

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,700
more favorable cleaner price action

92
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,379
towards the end of the week because of

93
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,879
the holiday you know on Tuesday July 4th

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,739
whether you celebrate July 4th or not

95
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,940
and you're outside the states doesn't

96
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,140
matter the Market's going to reflect

97
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,080
that lower volume so

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,599
when we see this run here it's occurring

99
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,120
on Thursday so generally I talked about

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,120
this on my most recent Twitter space

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,420
the idea of trading Mondays and when not

102
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,860
the trade Mondays I covered that

103
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,939
yesterday in about an hour and a half

104
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,260
audio presentation on Twitter and the

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,720
normal procedure is we want to try to

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,759
find ourselves before Wednesday of the

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
week of non-farm payroll Friday

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
because there was a holiday and because

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,720
of that being the case I felt that we

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,699
would have a lot cleaner price action on

111
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,259
the lighter portion which would be

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,600
Thursday and Friday and I'm delineating

113
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,060
that Thursday here at midnight near

114
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,680
clinical time

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,139
and we see we dropped down return back

116
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,300
into the Monday New York midnight

117
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,560
opening price

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
we rally

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
and also notice all the work around that

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,500
price level here

121
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,540
a lot of respect of that and then we

122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,759
have the Judah swing we rip higher take

123
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,800
out the buy side

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,840
here and then we drop back down look at

125
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,440
the bodies staying real close to the

126
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,479
high of that Weekly

127
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,979
fair value Gap

128
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,100
remember this pink area here is derived

129
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,360
from the weekly chart

130
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
so this right here indicates again as

131
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,220
soon as this candle closes and this one

132
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,139
opens rallies up and starts to trade

133
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,280
lower

134
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,560
we can trust the fact that this high and

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,660
that high here all of this was a run on

136
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,120
liquidity so

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,699
any rally up we would just watch and see

138
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,840
if it

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,240
is held at Bay

140
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,460
you know kept from going any higher at

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,199
the consequent encroachment of the high

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
to the close that candle so it would be

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,160
basically around the high of

144
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,919
103.42 one their balance

145
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,199
and then the market works it's way lower

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,000
on the lower end of that Weekly fair

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,400
value Gap the pink shaded area

148
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,199
we hit it as a resistance hit it as

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,020
resistance and then sharp break below

150
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,720
here we open come right back up for our

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
immediate rebalance

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,500
that right there as I taught you a month

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,460
ago

154
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,180
that immediate rebalance is very very

155
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,820
powerful so if we had to move lower than

156
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,639
that low here this is all the juice wing

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,639
so that Judas swing there is indicative

158
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,699
of manipulation stop run and before stop

159
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,020
run

160
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,819
we have to have a bias

161
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,440
and if we were looking for lower prices

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,220
and targeting this old load down here

163
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,080
using that old fair value gap on the

164
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,340
weekly chart

165
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,560
the displacement below that low is on

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
this candle right there

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,940
the very next candle we're opening up

168
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,280
rally back up to this candle's low so

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,660
there's no fair value Gap it's an

170
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,759
immediate rebalance the market does that

171
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,419
it's going to be in a quick hurry sudden

172
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,639
you know

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,979
urgent price delivery to get to a

174
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,180
specific level of liquidity or

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,699
inefficiency so we can see obviously the

176
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,860
liquid would be over here and it drops

177
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,539
down aggressively for that during the

178
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,440
non-prime payroll Friday

179
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
all of that again is the Judas swing so

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,139
weekly power three we open rally up

181
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,880
makes a high of the week and then trade

182
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,699
below all inside of the latter portions

183
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,080
of the week

184
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,300
Thursday and Friday

185
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
[Music]

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,460
zooming in onto a 15 minute time frame

187
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,340
for a dollar Index again here's that

188
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,259
Monday New York midnight opening price

189
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,000
we extend it throughout the entire day

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
of the week I have a fair value Gap in

191
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,180
here let me trade up into that during

192
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,740
the New York open

193
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,979
and it is the 8 30

194
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,900
payroll Friday

195
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,220
report

196
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,560
we break down

197
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,900
last up close candles consecutively that

198
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,080
is the bearish order block that closing

199
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,099
end of that price point right there

200
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,660
rallying right up to here perfectly to

201
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,099
that opening price

202
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,599
this is the change in the state of

203
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,880
delivery the algorithm will refer back

204
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,860
to that price right there

205
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,560
go right back up into it

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,840
drop aggressively for the sell side

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
you're a dollar everything you would

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,919
expect

209
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,099
in the dollar Index would be obviously

210
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,900
reversed here

211
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,000
I've been calling your attention to this

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,580
weekly volume and balance for months now

213
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
and while we did retrace back down to

214
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,539
this bullish order block uh we rallied

215
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,099
created a fair value Gap we had multiple

216
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,379
times trading down into it I told you we

217
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,000
would want to see this area here act as

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,620
an inversion fair value Gap that means

219
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,380
to trade above it find it as support and

220
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,059
then take into consideration the buy

221
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,159
side and then eventually up into the

222
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,899
weekly volume amount so if we do in fact

223
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,940
get lower prices on dollar Index I

224
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,640
really favor seeing us trade up into the

225
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,019
111

226
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,920
11 30 11 and a half and how far we get

227
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,720
into this weekly volume and balance you

228
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,339
know we'll have to see that but that's

229
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,839
the longer term draw on liquidity gun to

230
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,800
my head I think that's what we're going

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,380
to try to reach for

232
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,480
on the daily chart here's this relative

233
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,519
equal highs it's buy side in the weekly

234
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,980
volume imbalances above us there

235
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,200
weekly fair value Gap and again we're

236
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,760
treating this as an inversion for your

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,500
bank app so I'm just again making

238
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,120
reference to it here because it's a

239
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
weekly PD array but the logic is that

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,279
we're looking for it to act as support

241
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,140
it doesn't need to come back down and

242
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,820
touch it again this is something that

243
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,680
I'd like to see and if it does it would

244
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,779
promote the idea of maybe tape reading

245
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,480
it or demo trading it

246
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
last down closed candle is the Polish

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,220
order block and then we also had again

248
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,260
dug into this weekly fair value get

249
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,120
which is a discount we'll be looking for

250
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,060
a run up into these two premium arrays

251
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,339
right there short term would be the buy

252
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,279
side here how we treat above that

253
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,899
again think about what I said for the

254
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,660
dollar Index it's short-term low for the

255
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,820
dollar how we trade below that

256
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,320
would be

257
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,839
New Perspective of this this High here

258
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,880
as well we want to see it trade above it

259
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,560
and aggressively move towards these

260
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,839
relative equal highs I don't think it

261
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,279
we're going to bumped these highs and

262
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,620
then break them and then go lower I

263
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
think if we're going to go above there

264
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,200
we're going to treat definitely inside

265
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,480
that Weekly volume of balance so I would

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,000
be a little leery being bearish on your

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,920
own

268
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,600
all right here's the hourly chart for

269
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
euro dollar

270
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,660
you can see the buy side liquidity up

271
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,880
here again that Weekly inversion for

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,740
your value Gap and we have a buy side

273
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,620
and balance outside efficiency here

274
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,440
extending that forward

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,019
see we worked off of the daily bullet

276
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,339
order block which is that line right

277
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,480
there I made a little bit thicker so

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
that we can see it

279
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,779
and then we have this down closed candle

280
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,519
here

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,740
16 minute Bowl shoulder block

282
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,720
and then we have this here now what I'm

283
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,300
annotating here is really a two hour

284
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
order block

285
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,820
so this range from high to low all of

286
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,800
this right here

287
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,620
will be encapsulated in a two hour order

288
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,880
block so two hours of time

289
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,260
was a little bit longer term or larger

290
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,420
order block but I'm representing it on

291
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,640
the hourly chart so when I'm doing order

292
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,980
block Theory I'm actually toggling

293
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,899
through all the time frames even time

294
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,300
frames that are outside the normal range

295
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,860
like everybody's familiar with the

296
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,019
monthly weekly daily four hour one hour

297
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,399
15 minute time frame and then whatever

298
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,339
it is below 15 minute you might like I

299
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,339
will look for multiple time frames in

300
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,860
between the

301
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,660
standard go to time frames and a perfect

302
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,339
representation that would be is how I'm

303
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,579
teaching you the intraday charts on like

304
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,899
silver bullets and or the model 2022

305
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,120
on my YouTube channel I'll take you down

306
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,740
to a five minute chart then from five

307
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,060
minutes we drop down to a four minute

308
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,920
three two one

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,360
and

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,459
this year you've learned how I use even

311
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,279
less than a one minute chart for a 30

312
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,620
second 15 second five second chart

313
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,000
interval all of those ideas are a

314
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,920
top-down approach

315
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
the order block Theory really leans on

316
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,519
the understanding of where we are in the

317
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,380
price delivery Continuum so you're not

318
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,959
going to be able to just simply look at

319
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,060
one specific candle you know up or down

320
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,920
and didn't assume that that's an order

321
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,240
block there's a lot of things that have

322
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,339
to and come to

323
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,380
your understanding and I won't be doing

324
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,240
that in videos that the order block

325
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Theory I'll be teaching that solely in

326
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,640
book format but I'll have things on this

327
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,680
YouTube channel that will be

328
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,140
helpful in in studying that

329
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,980
so we can see we have a breaker here

330
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,019
okay and that's what specifically the

331
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,600
order block is that's being referenced

332
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,180
and how is it a breaker we have a swing

333
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,139
low

334
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,700
swing High

335
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,279
swing low that's lower than that one

336
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,040
relative equal lows but inside of that

337
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,100
range between high low and low

338
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,040
what do I have here I have a order block

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,800
I have a breaker and I have a buy side

340
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,360
to balance outside and efficiency any

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,220
one of those PD arrays could be utilized

342
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,260
for you that would be your multiplier

343
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm just annotating them that way you

344
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,820
can see and decide which one appeals to

345
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,760
you okay if neither of them appeal to

346
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,360
you and then it is what it is it's fine

347
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,180
but we can see 
we rally here 
we open
trade down hit the breaker then rally
really nice through the IFVG[weekly] 
and I would have enjoyed seeing it trade back down 
into it just to touch it one more time 
much like this right here did
it might want to trade down into that
but with this Gap here 
I would not want to see the high of that candle which is the low of the BISI 
I would not want to see that or CE which is half of this
shaded area here I would not want to see
that traded through
okay so as long as we're above all that I'm bullish on EURUSD

365
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,180
15 at Tony Fremont Euro

366
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,000
okay you can see again New York open

367
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
not from payroll Friday

368
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,180
that we dropped down into the daily

369
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,880
publish order block inside of

370
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,579
consequent encroachment of the Bots and

371
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:21,839
balance cell standard efficiency again

372
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,820
before we drop down to the 15 minute

373
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,440
time frame into that blue shaded area

374
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
rewind the video

375
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,820
you'll see that this run into this

376
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,620
there's two PD eraser being hit

377
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,320
shaded area

378
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,019
and the daily bullish order block

379
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,720
so between that and add to it if you

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
want

381
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,420
you can use the last down closed candle

382
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,779
right in here so order block

383
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,360
consequent encroaching with Bessie in

384
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,980
Daily order blocks there's a Confluence

385
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,260
of multiple things with inside the New

386
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,820
York open Kill Zone

387
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,880
which is 7 A.M to 9 00 A.M

388
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,060
New York local time and the 8 30 News

389
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,820
embargo lifting at uh not our payroll

390
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,320
numbers

391
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
we rally up and come back down hit that

392
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,699
breaker rally down close candle here

393
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,639
even though we run away from it we trade

394
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,260
back down until once more that right

395
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,000
there would have been a buy and then

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
rally and then we have this Gap here so

397
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,079
think about the midpoint of the Shaded

398
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
area here as long as we're above that

399
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
we're looking for higher prices more

400
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,399
specifically aiming for buy side and or

401
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,019
the weekly volume of balance

402
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,920
e-mini s p

403
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
here is the weekly chart and we have a

404
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
weekly volume of balance there as well I

405
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
haven't quite got into it yet

406
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
we traded down about halfway of this

407
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,260
down close candle here so it's really

408
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,940
important to see how we trade this week

409
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm not trying to pick the top but I

410
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,860
like the idea that we stopped halfway in

411
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,139
this down close candle here

412
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,760
now we've already traded into this

413
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,339
inefficiency there so I think this might

414
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,560
just be a reason to you know retrace

415
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,260
back into this range and then expand up

416
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,000
in that Weekly volume and balance

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,860
between this week and the next two weeks

418
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
or so I will work inside that range

419
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,940
that's what I'm expecting obviously all

420
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,100
that can change on Sunday's opening I'm

421
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,660
just giving you my forecast based on

422
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,180
what we have here I want to close the

423
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,519
basis of Friday

424
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,380
and not knowing how we're going to open

425
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,820
there's all kinds of things that could

426
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,860
obviously change it where we open how we

427
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,899
trade something going into Monday's

428
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,380
opening

429
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,079
daily shot here okay you can see we just

430
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,880
fell short of that Weekly volume balance

431
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,699
and we have several things in here I'm

432
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:39,839
looking at

433
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
we had the

434
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
Fairway Gap here that we worked off of

435
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
we have a volume imbalance right there

436
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and if we trade down once more

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,139
that coupled with this last down closed

438
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,279
candle I wouldn't want to see anything

439
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,639
below 4 400.

440
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,240
on a closing basis I would wouldn't be

441
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,799
uncomfortable for it to go right down

442
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,140
there Sunday into Monday and then try to

443
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,900
make them you know another move higher

444
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,859
but until we take out that

445
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,599
4400 on a closing basis

446
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,299
I I don't want to try to pick a top

447
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,459
on ES so we could just bang around in

448
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,380
here as long as we keep this order block

449
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,079
intact you know we're good if we lose

450
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,880
this order block

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
is down closed candle here my attention

452
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,220
goes right to this area right there

453
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,600
okay so the spot's gonna balance outside

454
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,440
of efficiency you know 4300 or so that

455
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,780
would be if we take out that low that's

456
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,640
where we're going but I don't see that

457
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,480
yet and I would favor you know obviously

458
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,160
a little bit lower in this volume and

459
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
balance

460
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,580
and then if at all trading into this

461
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,400
candle's High how we do that if at all

462
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,640
will be helpful to me at that time

463
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,940
seeing it so it certainly looks heavy in

464
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,780
here

465
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,760
looks really like it wants to you know

466
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,220
it it opened rallied up immediate

467
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,500
rebalance

468
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,140
it can accelerate aggressively lower but

469
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,419
I'm trying to avoid like I preach and

470
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,400
teach to you all I'm trying to avoid

471
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,460
trying to pick a top so this could

472
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,720
easily just come right back up and make

473
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,039
a higher high into that Weekly volume

474
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,059
amount so then give up the ghost

475
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,260
entirely

476
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,380
and go lower or you know accelerate to

477
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,320
the upside I'm right now waiting and

478
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,140
electing to see how we open Sunday and

479
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,440
how we trade overnight into 9 30 opening

480
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,780
on Monday morning so it kind of like

481
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,660
gives you a wait and see motive that I'm

482
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,480
adopting for this beginning of the new

483
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
week

484
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,100
all right hourly chart

485
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,720
SMP

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,059
notice that we are on electronic trading

487
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,799
hours that will change as I go through

488
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,880
the slides because I'm going to teach

489
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,240
you how to utilize both to get a better

490
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,039
depiction of what price is actually

491
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,360
trying to do

492
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,940
I like the idea that they have very very

493
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,280
smooth highs up in here

494
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
a fair value Gap there

495
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
we rallied up into that fair value Gap

496
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,299
and then treat it back down into the

497
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,799
buy-time balance outside efficiency so

498
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,419
this is a sibi sauce on a balanced by

499
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,000
side efficiency classification

500
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,020
within the PD array category of a fair

501
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,360
value Gap this is a fair value Gap too

502
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,160
that's shaded in blue but this fair

503
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,440
value Gap is a busy so buy side and

504
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,360
balance outside of efficiency cell side

505
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,000
imbalance by silent efficiency what is

506
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,760
it inefficient by side that means upside

507
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
delivery you see it go right up in there

508
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
and hits it there once it fills that

509
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,360
little area up with upside delivery and

510
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
it leaves it's fine it's ready to go to

511
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,220
another discount array or sell side

512
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,419
liquidity

513
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,860
it's interesting to see that we didn't

514
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,179
take out that low

515
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,340
so I'll be looking to see how we do that

516
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,460
if at all on Sunday I'd like to see it

517
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,340
Gap blower trade up hit the low of this

518
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,020
efficiency and then rip into the cell

519
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,299
side liquidity here if we accelerate to

520
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,340
the downside your attention goes right

521
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,280
in here okay so what I was mentioning on

522
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,539
the daily chart this is a much more

523
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,299
refined area where sell side is residing

524
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,340
how far below those relative equal lows

525
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,460
can it go that Gap right there okay and

526
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,600
if we accelerate through that then

527
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,340
obviously you have to look at you know

528
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,840
below these lows as I was mentioning on

529
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,080
The Daily

530
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,700
all right so now we're gonna get to a

531
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,580
little bit more in depth discussion

532
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,039
about inefficiencies

533
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,059
uh gaps and how to you know use this

534
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,559
information

535
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,380
one hour chart now with regular trading

536
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,299
hours so the only thing I've done was

537
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,860
take the previous

538
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,919
amount of price data and toggle this

539
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,299
little right from electronic trading

540
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,500
hours to regular trading hours and

541
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,640
regular trading hours is where you're

542
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,080
going to see the gaps

543
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,880
from the previous session to where we

544
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,179
open up the next day at 9 30. so

545
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,160
at settlement price

546
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,280
previous day and then where we open at 9

547
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
30. whatever the distance is separating

548
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
the settlement price of the previous day

549
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,419
and where we open at 9 30 New York local

550
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,380
time

551
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,080
that's our opening range

552
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
okay so that opening range Gap acts and

553
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,059
performs in the same manner as we would

554
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,660
expect a weekly volume imbalance

555
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,400
okay so

556
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,900
um

557
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,179
when we look at price

558
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,980
gaps like this

559
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,500
okay I want you to think about

560
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,559
how markets efficiently deliver price

561
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,500
okay I taught this analogy using a paint

562
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,380
roller okay and imagine this white

563
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,260
shaded area background is a wall in your

564
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,100
house

565
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,679
and you want to paint

566
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,780
in these little areas where you need to

567
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,600
have pain applied okay so maybe you've

568
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,100
already painted your house

569
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,720
and the paint's now faded over there's

570
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,700
hand prints like like a child like I had

571
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,580
five kids and obviously they would put

572
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,200
their hands on the walls and make marks

573
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
and such and we'd have to have them

574
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,340
walls painted and some kind of blemish

575
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,020
or some kind of inefficiency and paint

576
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,600
exists between these two candle Bodies

577
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
Okay this candle's body here and this

578
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,080
candle's body here between that

579
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,220
opening price net

580
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,100
price there's a separation

581
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,620
of price delivery that did not have your

582
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,460
body

583
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,140
so I'm highlighting that and extending

584
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
it all the way through

585
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,380
when I show you these ranges I'm not

586
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,520
going to drop down to the lower time

587
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
frames the homework assignment for you

588
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
is to have these on your charts

589
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,799
and then drop down their lower time

590
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,500
frames on electronic Trading

591
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,059
okay so just know that I'm showing you

592
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,620
something so that way you can observe

593
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,620
and identify things and Discover it on

594
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,020
your own and have that aha moment

595
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,900
but this distinction here between these

596
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,240
two candles opening

597
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
opening here there's no bodies between

598
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,039
these two price points so that

599
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,720
inefficiency

600
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
you want to extend those out in time

601
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,679
because they'll eventually be offered by

602
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,960
side and sell side that means upside and

603
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,460
downside delivery

604
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,500
here we only had a partial delivery of

605
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,799
upside and then drops so from this point

606
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,760
here

607
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
up to here that is the real inefficiency

608
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
that remains because we've already had

609
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
this partial and this movement down so

610
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,480
think of it as a paint roller up and

611
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,600
down so from this opening price in that

612
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,100
opening price

613
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,440
up to right there

614
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,240
it has been offered

615
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,760
delivery of price so there's a real

616
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,980
separation between this high and net

617
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,760
candles opening price there's a distinct

618
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
inefficiency there

619
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
but nonetheless you can see how we

620
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,760
respected that

621
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
opening price there look how we're

622
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,659
treating it with these bodies here

623
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,600
and then we have another Gap there

624
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,820
we have a gap here but I'm showing you

625
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,280
how inside this range

626
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,080
you're anticipating an expecting price

627
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,840
to deliver both sides up and down that's

628
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,700
inefficiently delivered price

629
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,080
you can see how we worked off the low

630
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,400
here

631
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,679
and we had another Gap there

632
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,900
so it wants to reach up into that every

633
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,000
time I'm showing you one of these ranges

634
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,039
I want you to go into not regular

635
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,380
trading hours but electronic trading

636
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,200
hours and study how price delivers

637
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,260
you'll see how it is real Dynamic

638
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,720
support and resistance

639
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,960
it's not readily understood or seen by

640
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
most Traders I mean obviously I've been

641
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,640
teaching it this year but

642
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
you won't see it in books okay you're

643
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,500
gonna look at it right away and think

644
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,299
it's oh it's supply and demand oh or

645
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,520
it's a classic support resistance I

646
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,780
promise you there's no books out there

647
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,100
with support and resistance with this

648
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,400
idea it isn't there okay they may see a

649
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,940
gap but they're not looking at gaps

650
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,000
multiple times in the future okay and as

651
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,220
soon as price would go from

652
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,140
here to here they would consider that

653
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,940
Gap closed and there's no more concern

654
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,260
about it and that's What Separates Me

655
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,460
from retail

656
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,559
because the fact that Gat was created

657
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,360
the algorithm

658
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,159
will refer back to those three price

659
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,440
points which is the low consequent

660
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,820
protein which is midpoint of the Gap and

661
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,260
in the high

662
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,820
okay so whatever the extreme boundaries

663
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,559
high and low and whatever the middle

664
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,480
point is

665
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,240
those three specific price points are

666
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,400
very very sensitive and if you want to

667
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,100
go one degree beyond that

668
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,679
you can split that range up in quadrants

669
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,580
so the first 25 50 75 percent of the

670
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,520
entire inefficiency and then the high of

671
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,840
the inefficiency

672
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,299
and that's what I want you to do for

673
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,179
your electronic trading hours study so

674
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,520
look at all of the price action in here

675
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,740
even though there's gaps missing price

676
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,779
data here in electronic trading hours

677
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,659
there is no Gap it's it's actually being

678
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,059
traded through

679
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,520
and then from here to here

680
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,919
so

681
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,179
that's one there

682
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,140
the other one is here

683
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,360
okay and what you're doing again is

684
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,400
toggling it from regular trading hours

685
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,500
to electronic trading hours and you'll

686
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,200
study how price delivers inside this

687
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,419
range here you don't want to have all of

688
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,159
the inefficiencies on the chart the same

689
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,480
time that way it helps you track what

690
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,640
you're looking for in study time of the

691
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,559
day look for inefficiencies think like

692
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,380
silver bullets in the London session in

693
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,080
the New York session both am session and

694
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,340
PM session

695
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,480
up

696
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
you're going to be

697
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,640
surprised to see how much Precision that

698
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,919
these levels will offer not just the

699
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,299
high and the low but consequent

700
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,720
encouragement and 75 50 and 25 of those

701
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,940
respective ranges

702
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,980
and then lastly the one here

703
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,860
okay so that way you can see

704
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,140
these are three homework assignments I

705
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,580
want you to go through on your time

706
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,600
frames

707
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,940
lower than obviously the one hour chart

708
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,159
and you'll see that these respective

709
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,620
inefficiencies have a really interesting

710
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,299
characteristics where setups can form

711
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,740
all right 15 minute timer

712
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,340
I taught in the one setup for life

713
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,460
tutorial on my YouTube channel

714
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,140
it goes over how to

715
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,419
classify specific liquidity pools and

716
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,580
how I break down these and look back at

717
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,279
very specific points of liquidity I

718
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,260
mentioned the London session highs and

719
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,900
Loan session lows we have a sell-side

720
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,080
liquidity pool here Thursday New York PM

721
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,179
session Buy sell liquidity London

722
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,520
session Buy sell liquidity sell side

723
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,419
here that would be the London session

724
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,400
for this day here

725
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,500
and at non-form payroll Friday we open

726
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,080
up rally up

727
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,740
take the buy side here on the

728
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,080
Thursday New York PM session and then we

729
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,620
rip lower to take out the London session

730
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,720
then we rally up one more time

731
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
trade back down to a bullish order block

732
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,640
and rip higher attacking the Thursday

733
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,919
London session by side liquidity pool

734
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,799
then in the afternoon we reverse course

735
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,140
and go all the way back down to attack

736
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,360
the rejection Block in the original

737
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,919
South Side liquidity pool it was

738
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,360
interesting to see it not take out that

739
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,279
low so I think it has unfinished

740
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,380
business going into Sunday's openings so

741
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,600
again I'd like to see us open lower the

742
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,740
Gap lower

743
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,840
and how we trade lower if at all below

744
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,419
that low just be mindful this little

745
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,059
tiny Gap here it might give you a run

746
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,919
down there going through this Gap and

747
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,580
rip higher and defer a run below that

748
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,039
low if it's going to do it or if it does

749
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,600
break lower it can just be a quick

750
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,820
sudden run but I just want you to be

751
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,919
aware of that little Gap right there in

752
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,480
the event that should we start running

753
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,400
for this low this could be one of those

754
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,860
little speed bumps that cause us to you

755
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,020
know pull back up in the range and then

756
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,600
at a later time uh take that low out so

757
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,340
it's a matter of wait and see see how we

758
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,500
trade on Sunday's opening price and into

759
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,799
Monday

760
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,900
all right five minute chart one e mini s

761
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,340
p

762
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,080
same respective liquidity pools

763
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,299
annotated here okay you can see nice

764
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,919
order block

765
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,200
trading into it here this is a classic

766
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,899
optimal trade entry trade as well

767
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,600
and it starts at accumulate and rally

768
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,340
higher

769
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,500
tearing into the Thursday lemon session

770
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,899
Boston liquidity and the market reverses

771
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,779
it breaks down I did Longs all through

772
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,520
here on NASDAQ

773
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,919
and then I shorted it going into the PM

774
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:41,940
session

775
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,820
on NASDAQ so I didn't do any work on s p

776
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,120
here

777
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,440
here is the regular trading hours on a

778
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
five minute chart and taking this up

779
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,000
back up this low here now why am I using

780
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,260
this low

781
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,340
and that the closing price here

782
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,700
there's a specific pattern here

783
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,799
if you are a student of mine that have

784
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,779
been with me for a while you know what

785
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,880
this pattern is

786
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,500
I'll give you a second I'll I'll talk

787
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,059
about something else I'll come back that

788
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,740
in a minute but here's the Thursday

789
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,600
London session by sell liquidity it

790
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,039
rallies up into that

791
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,880
and then trades up into that low here

792
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
and then starts to break lower and

793
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,279
aggressively moves towards the relative

794
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,500
equal low side here so this is a classic

795
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,200
ICT Market maker cell model so we have

796
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,240
accumulation

797
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,720
reaccumulation

798
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,460
reversal low risk cell

799
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,399
distribution redistribution second stage

800
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,559
distribution basically and an aggressive

801
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,980
sell-off into cell signed liquidity

802
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,620
this pattern over here

803
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,179
is a breaker

804
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,779
okay so it's a high low higher high

805
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,340
so

806
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,740
you always want to refer to that even if

807
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,820
there's a gap

808
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,100
like this if there's ever a breaker

809
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,880
there

810
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,580
always give the opportunity to see if

811
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,039
the market will respect that not so much

812
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,659
this one here because this is a this is

813
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,480
an opening range as well so where we

814
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,059
close here and we opened down here you

815
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,980
would have that shaded so extending out

816
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,480
in the future you can see we dug up into

817
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,740
that as well

818
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,380
again you would note that opening

819
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,480
and the close respectively on these two

820
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
candles and extend that range forward

821
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,860
okay and you can see that's what we

822
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,659
basically did here we stayed inside that

823
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:31,559
range

824
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,899
and then we got down here

825
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,820
to that Gap

826
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,220
that huge in efficiency

827
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,380
you you don't want to just go right back

828
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,480
to the previous

829
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,940
sessions closing price where I like to

830
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,380
usually do that

831
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,159
if we have a breaker a breaker will many

832
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,600
times

833
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,740
disrupt that total closure of the gap

834
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,020
so how do I know certain gas won't

835
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,720
entirely close there are certain things

836
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,039
obviously that I've already taught you

837
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,500
this is another one here okay so if

838
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,299
there's a breaker inside the range that

839
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,760
would be considered for a gap closure

840
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,919
you want to consider where that

841
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,440
down closed candles low is and you can

842
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,240
see we have respected that here

843
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,000
all right one minute charts

844
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,299
s p you can see we have a higher low in

845
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,340
NASDAQ we have a lower low

846
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,539
so I elected to go with the NASDAQ

847
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,520
simply because I had some students

848
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,980
asking me you know why am I only doing

849
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,220
SMP can I do something with NASDAQ so I

850
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,080
went into NASDAQ and I basically beat it

851
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,299
all up you know I went long in it and

852
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,620
then I went shorter than it I didn't get

853
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,840
the last hole run lower on the PM

854
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,580
session I didn't explain it in a

855
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,860
recording when you can watch me do live

856
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,720
executions in a video on my YouTube

857
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,659
channel for Friday's PM session for

858
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,159
Nasdaq

859
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,779
I'll show all the executions on the

860
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,760
upside and I did some live executions

861
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,299
and management on the lower end for the

862
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,940
NASDAQ but I mentioned how I felt it you

863
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,980
know it could go lower but I didn't have

864
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,019
the time to be able to spend managing

865
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,080
the entirety until the close but a

866
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,159
really nice run into uh

867
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,220
a lower low here higher low on smt

868
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,919
diversions for s p s p rallied higher

869
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,340
NASDAQ followed suit and then we have a

870
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,399
disruption up here so we have short term

871
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:36,899
low here

872
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,740
which helped me time the potential

873
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,140
intermediate term High I did try to take

874
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,000
a trade you know

875
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,760
go into this here on this respective

876
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,320
area on NASDAQ which I'm not going to

877
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,159
show you here because I'm going to

878
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
actually include it in the discussion

879
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,880
tomorrow for my macros lecture

880
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,340
but the uh I was trying to show a losing

881
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,419
trade because everybody's like you

882
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,100
always show a winning trade each other

883
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,440
you know share a losing trade so I was

884
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,419
really trying to be facetious and put a

885
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,219
short on

886
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,560
and have a stop loss really really tight

887
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,359
so that way can stop me out and I was

888
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,739
going to show it on Twitter just you

889
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,699
know

890
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,540
be facetious but it ended up making a

891
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,560
run where I knew it was going to be

892
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,060
profitable so I closed the trade on

893
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,980
again it would be on that and you'll see

894
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,440
it it's actually on my

895
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,080
video prior to this one

896
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,300
so just go back one more day and you'll

897
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,379
see it

898
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,520
but the uh the idea was that you

899
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
the s p doesn't really have a clear

900
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,918
swing load that would be clear when we

901
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,859
drop lower but a NASDAQ does so I

902
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,659
mentioned it in one of the recordings I

903
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,580
placed on my Twitter feed

904
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,020
and

905
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,080
once I knew it was running in my favor I

906
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,339
was like okay I already know what this

907
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,780
is this is a

908
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,720
Market Excel model and all this

909
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
consolidation it wouldn't want to go

910
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,140
below these relative equal lows and we

911
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,480
saw that actually happen here but

912
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,599
counseling this rejection Block in

913
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,580
addition to all this here so that would

914
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,020
be a nice area for cell solid liquidity

915
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,339
you can see we did in fact reach down

916
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,800
into it for silver bullets between 10

917
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,420
o'clock in the morning and 11 o'clock in

918
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,400
the morning New York local time we have

919
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,619
a fair value Gap there after hitting an

920
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,060
older block and

921
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,680
fair value got there

922
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,619
we rally higher trade back down in

923
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,960
Silver Bullet run for relative equal

924
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,599
highs so buying here and getting out

925
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,400
there just at that high here that's

926
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
enough for a trade you don't even have

927
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
to hold on to any of this up here in the

928
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,700
PM session Silver Bullet same idea this

929
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,099
is in Reverse I'll hit consolidation so

930
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,140
when you take a silver bullet if you're

931
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,480
seeing consolidation like this have this

932
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,339
in your notes

933
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,740
wait for displacement we see that here

934
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,900
very energetic drop

935
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,660
if everybody got sell short there and

936
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,359
again reach four five handles minimum

937
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,540
and if we had this area down here for a

938
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,760
buy side it will many times want to

939
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,560
offer a re-delivery to that as well

940
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,359
because

941
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,880
every old liquidity pool acts like an

942
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,760
inefficiency it'll many times revisit it

943
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,880
and act as

944
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,579
the opposite so if we were seeing buy

945
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,099
side as a draw here

946
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,839
the algorithm will refer back to this

947
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,660
area here and draw back down into it

948
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,420
but it has to be some measure of why it

949
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,820
was drawn to for buy side it's not just

950
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,579
simply resistance resistance broken turn

951
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,079
support because notice it didn't do

952
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,940
anything for sport so I've already

953
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,960
canceled that idea you're already

954
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,740
thinking oh he's just talking about

955
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,240
scoring so it says no

956
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,540
it's a matter of taking this information

957
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,780
and really understanding what would be

958
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,079
support to buy or a target for a draw on

959
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,900
liquidity so again I have a lot of

960
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,180
lectures that will come that describe

961
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,619
how to do all this stuff but it can't be

962
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,359
taught obviously in one sitting there's

963
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,579
a lot of things that at my disposal and

964
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,440
I want to make it available to you but

965
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,300
everything a little bit at a time

966
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,040
because it's already probably too much

967
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,700
for most of you

968
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,079
but we found something in this that was

969
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,060
insightful and helpful and until I'll

970
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,380
talk to you next time

971
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,040
be safe
