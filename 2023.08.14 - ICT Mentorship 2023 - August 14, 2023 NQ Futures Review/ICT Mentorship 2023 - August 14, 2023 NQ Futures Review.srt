1
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,400
hi welcome back folks it's a quick

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
little review on NASDAQ features this is

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
the September delivery contract of 2023.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,619
all right so

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,119
this morning overnight in the London

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,260
session

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,480
we had a little bit of a

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
rejection on the low

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,620
of Friday

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,559
so using this town close candle has a

11
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,600
bull shorter block

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,780
we teared up into this premium Wick

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,879
so consequent encroachments mid point of

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,960
that right there I'll let you figure

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,840
that out on your own using your fib

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,780
and we had the market trade up on Monday

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,760
and then this is the new day it starts

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,039
at 6 PM that's what we're seeing here

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,079
four hour chart

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,000
okay so we have relative

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
highs here so there's liquidity resting

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,439
rate above that

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,060
Market again traded

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,040
into the daily bullet shoulder block

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,720
we had a shift in Market structure we'll

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,020
look at that on Lower time frames

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,020
and really aggressively into the close

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,560
of today

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,000
on the hourly chart you can see there is

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,979
a city this is a sell Side imbalanced by

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,659
sine and efficiency

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,400
so after

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,860
four o'clock we sell Market trade up

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,720
into that

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,700
we want to take a lot of

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,220
details in this area in here

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,799
after this shift in Market structure so

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,460
this High here once we went lower it

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,119
lower low sell side taken leaving by

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,399
side here then by side taken but

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,799
extremely

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,799
aggressive through these highs SO

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,899
trading back down not taking out that

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:01,740
low

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,180
more specifically we're going to look at

46
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
that Wick as well and then all of the

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,420
marker structure in here

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,860
15 minute time frame here you can see

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,200
that I sell liquidity here

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
now these two levels are

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,360
the 60 Minute or hourly sell sign

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,040
amounts by sound efficiency respective

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,540
high and low

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,520
it doesn't look like a city

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,220
in here because we have multiple candles

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,440
let me go back up one more

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,420
time up into the hourly chart so you can

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,580
get your frame of reference these two

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,920
levels here are anchored on the hourly

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,160
chart

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
right here okay so this candle is low

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,060
this candle is high

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,980
they're not annotated here

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,900
but the same respective levels are going

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,260
to be here

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,980
so that's this 60 Minute or hourly sippy

67
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,420
low

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,870
60 Minute or hourly to be high

69
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,680
[Music]

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,599
now this time frame here

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,760
is a 15 minute time frame

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
but more specifically look down here in

73
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,780
the lower right hand corner rths regular

74
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,319
trading hours

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
so we had sell side below here we traded

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,319
down below that

77
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,140
and then we have aggressive shift above

78
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,440
these highs here and then leaving a gap

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
so that Gap there we're going to treat

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,159
that as a breakaway Gap in the brick

81
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,379
wake up high and Breakaway Gap

82
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,200
respective low

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,080
an initiated area here okay see that

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,680
yellow box this is Friday August 11 2023

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,659
opening range Gap

86
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,060
so you can only see these with the

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,500
regular trading hours toggled on your

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,360
trading bill

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
so

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,260
from here to here these two respective

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,480
candles

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
you traded around in here on Friday but

93
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
left that portion open these gas will be

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,099
referred to by the algorithm they don't

95
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,500
just fill and forget it's

96
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,720
traded all the way up into it here

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
and then look at the bodies respecting

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,659
the high

99
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,760
in here and then one more top right

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,900
there

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,420
in the afternoon session and then

102
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
aggressively runs for the relative equal

103
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,060
highs and that drawn liquidity

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,478
the 60-minute city this inefficiency is

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,519
this candle is high this candle is low

106
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,340
which is a busy it's the opposite of

107
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,320
what this was on the 60 Minute chart but

108
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
now on a 15 minute time frame this

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
exists on both regular trading hours and

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,759
electronic trading hours

111
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,800
so these levels here will be seen and

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,540
they'll be visible we look at the next

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,840
slide

114
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,419
again same 60 Minute City

115
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,180
high and low respectively

116
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,040
9 30 Friday

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
that starts the opening range Gap but we

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,759
don't see a gap there do we why because

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,259
we're looking at electronic trading

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,220
hours

121
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,680
right down here eth

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
okay so electronic trading hours you

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,540
have to refer to the Gap

124
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,419
on the rth regular trading hours once

125
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,979
you annotate them you want to toggle

126
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,320
back to electronic trading hours

127
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,780
and have your annotation stressed on

128
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,080
your chart

129
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,639
relative equal lows sales High liquidity

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,919
be pierced through that

131
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,259
then we have a wick okay so this is a

132
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,180
discount Wick midpoint of that is

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,560
consequent encroachment you can see we

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
hit that beautifully here

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,020
at the opening at 9 30. did not take out

136
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,940
the low we had a shift and marker

137
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,220
structure here very very energetic price

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,180
run

139
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,160
it drops down looks like a bull flag

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,580
retail wanted that to act as a bullfly

141
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,220
imbalance

142
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,419
rejection block lowest down close price

143
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,820
Trace through it consequent encroachment

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,820
of the discount Wick here trusting that

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,620
this low should not be taken or pierced

146
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,240
because of shift and Market structure

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,139
here

148
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,020
mark it trades aggressively higher above

149
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
what a short-term high right there on

150
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,100
the 15-minute time frame

151
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,740
we open trade down

152
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,660
to this candle is high which is an or

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,500
block

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,520
side here

155
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
buy side here and the inefficiency as

156
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,800
well

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,479
here's that 57 balance outside of

158
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,620
efficiency

159
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,080
respective high and low

160
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,000
and that Breakaway Gap that we

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,100
mentioned here on the regular trading

162
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,259
hours can be seen also on electronic

163
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,620
trading hours

164
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
and eventually after four o'clock we see

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,180
it trade up into that

166
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,259
hourly City

167
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,580
if I make Candlestick chart we're

168
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,280
looking at a little bit more detail here

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,259
we have the low

170
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,300
relative equal low So Below that's what

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,180
cell solid liquidity you drop down

172
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,280
there let me ride back above

173
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,919
that Wick that was seen on the 15 minute

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
time frame it doesn't show it here

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,139
but look at the bodies respecting

176
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,160
yeah

177
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
and it hits it here at 9 30. if they

178
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
open we trade through short-term shifts

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,660
in Market structure there much like we

180
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,639
saw it here on a higher time frame

181
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,620
we're seeing it now on a lower time

182
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,259
frame there and then we drop down into

183
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,600
the bullish order block this is also

184
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,639
immediate rebalance on the 15 minute

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,900
time frame

186
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,880
and we rally up now I did make a mistake

187
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,919
today while I was tweeting if you go to

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,180
look at my tweets I didn't did too many

189
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,160
of them today but I mentioned that there

190
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,780
was a fair value gap on the two minute

191
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,599
chart and that's not what I was looking

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,979
at I was looking at a five minute chart

193
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,780
and this is the fair value Gap I

194
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,639
mentioned that price was struggling with

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,620
initially and offering short-term

196
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,819
resistance

197
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,340
let me trade it back down into this down

198
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,860
closed candle and price rally through

199
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,960
came back down and touched the top of

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,419
that fair value got and reach for the

201
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,759
liquidity that I was mentioning prior to

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,099
all that anyway uh fifteen thousand one

203
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,919
thirty eight which was the

204
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,919
buy side in the afternoon on Friday I'm

205
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
looking at Friday's trading and not so

206
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,660
much emphasis on Sunday so if you're

207
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,400
using Sunday's highs

208
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
here for buy side and that's fine

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
there's nothing wrong with that

210
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,940
but I'm taking it back to Friday's price

211
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,060
trading in the afternoon

212
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,440
and then we have the relative equal

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,879
highs here

214
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,460
on Monday morning going around the seven

215
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,360
o'clock hour

216
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,400
so we ended up trading off of the five

217
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,020
minute Share value Gap

218
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,880
and if you look at a two-minute chart

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,559
you'll see there there's no fear about

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,299
you got there to draw on so I didn't

221
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,919
bother to take a look at the tweets I'm

222
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,940
sure some of you probably already

223
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,620
corrected me were trying to correct me

224
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,899
without doing other things today while I

225
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,600
was reading the tape the market rallies

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
creates the high of the Breakaway Gap

227
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,540
here

228
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,800
reps higher takes the 15 167 buy side

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
and then because my attention would be

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,920
elsewhere

231
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
I know some of you like to jump on board

232
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
when I'm pointing things out I just said

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,339
make sure that uh

234
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,320
you're content there you move to the

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,300
sidelines

236
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,740
eventually I took it out the buy side

237
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,240
here I made no mention of this by the

238
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
way but it's pretty obvious you know

239
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,300
when we're looking at things like this

240
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,640
this was where buy side would be and it

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,779
above that would be what the

242
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,300
inefficiency on the 60 Minute chart so

243
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,000
the level up here is the hourly City

244
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,060
High this level here is the hourly

245
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,800
Sibilo

246
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,600
it wasn't treated until we got to after

247
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,339
the day session ended

248
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,140
and again here's the immediate rebalance

249
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,260
here just a wonderful signature and I've

250
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,700
been getting a lot of feedback from this

251
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,279
one here from everyone now utilizing it

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,440
and if you have your bias correct if you

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,180
know that the draw on liquidity is

254
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,800
likely above or below the marketplace

255
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
and you're trading at the specific time

256
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,180
of day that would be indicative of

257
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,360
volatility coming in this is one of the

258
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,980
strongest absolutely strongest

259
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,380
signatures that I look for when price is

260
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,360
giving me that I know that the algorithm

261
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,459
will be in the spool price aggressively

262
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,540
in the direction I'm looking for

263
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,440
okay five minute chart zoomed in a

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,860
little bit here so here is the 15 minute

265
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,779
Candlestick that creates that discount

266
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,959
Wick the midpoint level here you see

267
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,700
what drops down into that I'm going to

268
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,279
type for the 9 30 opening you drop down

269
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,839
and

270
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,160
if I was just showing you this time

271
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,440
frame here you would see this and think

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,700
you know why didn't you use this

273
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,740
Candlestick ICT and that's generally

274
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,600
what has happened in the past

275
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,200
because I'm looking at things on a time

276
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
frame to talk about that

277
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,620
at the time in my teachings even old

278
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,000
videos

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
um one of the things that creep in is

280
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
you'll say well I see appointment that

281
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,120
Candlestick and why is it not the lowest

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
down closed candle it's because I'm

283
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,380
taking your attention to a specific time

284
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,500
frame and because The annotation may be

285
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,720
anchored to a higher time frame that may

286
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,800
have caused

287
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,100
confusion in the past okay so it's not

288
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,779
that I'm picking different candlesticks

289
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,980
or trying to hide something from you

290
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,140
it's just a matter of me moving from one

291
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,060
Higher time frame down to a lower time

292
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,040
frame and my annotations anchored to the

293
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
higher time frame

294
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
so it's going to look a little bit

295
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
different as you probably have already

296
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,820
been paying attention and noticing when

297
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,360
we look through that

298
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,660
continuum of price delivery from the

299
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,740
higher time frame to the lower time

300
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,160
frame you want to have the anchored PD

301
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,660
arrays on the higher time frame but

302
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,040
you're using the lower time frames to

303
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,600
refine

304
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,120
in terms of accuracy and such

305
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,579
but here's that five minute

306
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,200
array Gap here

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,660
you trade up and through it find some

308
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,180
support there and then we rally up take

309
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,079
the buy side 15 167.

310
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
now notice that we have this

311
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
inefficiency here

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
on the five minute chart but it's part

313
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,480
of the larger bicep imbalance also

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,240
inefficiency high and low that is the 15

315
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,399
minute time frame but notice there's a

316
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,980
small little Gap there at the bottom end

317
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,560
of the 15 minute python imbalance so

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,880
it's on efficiency

319
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,399
go back and Rewind the video back and

320
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,380
look at the 15 minute time frame these

321
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,820
two blue lines here are anchored on the

322
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,040
15-minute time frame but just to drop

323
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,560
down to the low of it it's also doing so

324
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,120
because there's a small little portion

325
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,860
of inefficiency right there between this

326
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,420
candlesticks high in this candlesticks

327
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,660
low if this didn't occur and say this

328
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,980
candle was trading all the way down to

329
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,720
that level there already

330
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,519
then I would only look for this little

331
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,040
area here in this drop down and not be

332
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
sufficient enough for me

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,060
to look for a long entry to get in sync

334
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,880
with the afternoon using the lunch macro

335
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,139
so

336
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,540
we actually see the bodies respecting

337
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,519
again the Boston amount cells on

338
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,320
efficiency on the 15-minute time frame

339
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,880
we have a little bit of a wick in here

340
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,980
but it trades down into what the Friday

341
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,800
August 11th opening range Gap

342
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
so it's treating it now as support

343
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,660
so these levels are like

344
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,700
creating an x-ray view in price action

345
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,380
these are the things that the algorithm

346
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,180
is looking at that most people are not

347
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,680
looking at now you might think oh well

348
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,880
you know everybody knows about the Gap

349
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,620
ICT come on you act like you invented a

350
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,720
gap now I invented the logic that I'm

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,399
teaching you with the algorithm will

352
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,300
follow

353
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,820
okay that's authorship so when the

354
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,680
market trades down and finds the the top

355
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,720
of that Gap it's going to treat it and

356
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,180
refer back to it

357
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,860
and re-capitalize allow smart money to

358
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,620
reclaim bullish entries on that same

359
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,480
premise there

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,760
okay so there's no there's no support or

361
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,380
resistance idea over here

362
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,959
it's the Gap in itself that it's traded

363
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,220
down into

364
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,620
and then we touch one more time device

365
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,500
outside efficiency High

366
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,019
and then all three races we go immediate

367
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,399
rebalance on the 15 minute time frame

368
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,120
and then zips up into after market hours

369
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,579
into the city

370
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,420
level here

371
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,519
okay in the one minute chart

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,860
you can see we drop down into I want to

373
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
take your attention over to this little

374
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,579
area right here so you can see that we

375
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,880
had this small little Gap right there

376
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,160
and the low that was not going to be

377
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,279
taken out because it's a 15 minute

378
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,800
Wick it trades down to take out the sell

379
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,639
side

380
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,380
so this drop down in here go back and

381
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,060
watch the beginning of the video it

382
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
drops down takes the sell side there and

383
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,760
then it leaves this Gap so we drop down

384
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,440
into that perfectly

385
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,100
and then we have Market rally up shift

386
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,199
the marker structure there bullish order

387
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,779
block and takes off and then this little

388
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,180
Gap right here I refer to that also real

389
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,920
time and

390
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,940
after this is the key okay after

391
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,220
I mentioned that the fifteen thousand

392
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,779
one thirty eight and fifteen thousand

393
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,240
one sixty seven buy side so if I'm

394
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,040
pointing that out and I'm saying watch

395
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
this fair value Gap

396
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,880
your mind should immediately jump to

397
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,820
okay he's pointing out this pure value

398
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,760
Gap with 138

399
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,699
and 167 by side

400
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,279
prior to that fair value Gap so how

401
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,600
would we use that

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,820
it's an inversion fair value

403
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,560
and we'll zoom in here in a couple

404
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,940
minutes

405
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,860
and the market rallies up creating

406
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,139
relative equal highs going into the

407
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,120
lunch hour dropping down taking sell

408
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
side repricing to the low of the

409
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,279
Boston amount of cell sign efficiency

410
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,600
here's the buy side imbalance also

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,839
efficiency low and the busy high it's

412
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,180
these blue levels are trades down to it

413
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,699
here that's a perfect area to go long

414
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:45,620
and run up into the buy side

415
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,420
you see that's in fact what we got here

416
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,720
and then it rallies up stop short of the

417
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,480
highs here so it creates a triple top

418
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,180
that is absolutely poison

419
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,320
retail Traders will see that say wow

420
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,360
that's really strong resistance and it

421
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
drops back down into the busy High by

422
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,380
some valve cell efficiency high and it

423
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,540
touches again that old Friday opening

424
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,459
range Gap High

425
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,320
touches it one more time gives a kiss

426
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,459
goodbye and then also the races will go

427
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,040
immediate rebalance there and then sends

428
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,320
it higher into the last hour of trading

429
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,160
uh here's the tweet I told you at 9 57

430
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,779
New York local time

431
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,760
look at the one minute I guess we're at

432
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,899
one minute chart here one minute NASDAQ

433
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,360
947 candle note that fair value Gap

434
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,760
that's this candle right here

435
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,259
okay and I'm telling you look at it

436
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,399
right there

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,160
after I pointed out fifteen thousand one

438
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,320
sixty seven by side

439
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,420
so the market draws up into there we

440
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,800
find some support at that five minute

441
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,360
fair value Gap and that's my fault for

442
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,040
miscalling the five minute the two

443
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,839
minute chart I apologize for that but

444
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,160
nonetheless even if you take that out

445
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,740
the context is we were going up the

446
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,019
fifteen thousand one sixty seven I

447
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,399
mentioned if we failed to get to these

448
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,740
levels all the focus would go down to

449
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,319
fifteen thousand zero twenty

450
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,720
but because we got that fifteen thousand

451
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,819
zero twenty is not likely

452
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,439
so it's going to continuously draw

453
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,380
higher and we saw that happen here

454
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,760
all right and looking at the last

455
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,939
portion of trading today

456
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,740
here's the two o'clock at three o'clock

457
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,339
Silver Bullet the entry is right here

458
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,900
and after that rally up did it take out

459
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,080
the buy side yet no so this fair value

460
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,000
Gap can be what

461
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,160
reclaimed it can trade back down into it

462
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
again so that's trading back down into

463
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,240
it finding some support rallies once

464
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,640
more creates a fair value Gap there

465
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,740
institutional order for entry drill and

466
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,360
volume and balance between these two

467
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,740
candles bodies

468
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,679
rallies in the last portion of the last

469
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
hour of trading in the New York session

470
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
in the park on close macro that sends

471
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,700
price careening into the buy side

472
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,020
liquidity here

473
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,700
and then we have an immediate rebalance

474
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,620
with an order block and a fair value Gap

475
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,000
really really strong really really

476
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
strong and it sends it higher aiming for

477
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,940
that hourly City low which you know did

478
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,640
after four o'clock trading today

479
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,880
all right folks hope you enjoyed that if

480
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,260
you found insightful give me a thumbs up

481
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,059
