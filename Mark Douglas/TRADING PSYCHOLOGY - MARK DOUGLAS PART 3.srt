1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,639
in this section we're going to discuss

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,549
how prices move and who the players are

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,919
behind it when you understand how

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,290
traders make prices move then how you

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,120
need to think to generate consistent

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,860
results will start to become clear to

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,980
you okay where we're going now is that

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,640
is that I think what I said when we do

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,300
just before the break is that when you

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,760
guys understand the nature of price

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,869
movement and how any technical

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,308
methodology that's based on a

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,630
mathematical formula or a price pattern

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,879
interacts with that movement when you

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,460
understand that relationship how you

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,500
need to think will become self-evident

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
do you remember me saying that okay

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,579
this is the part that we're going into

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,520
right now okay in other words where you

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,620
understand just exactly how prices move

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,270
because what I found in doing these

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,109
workshops over the years that here I'm

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,410
I'm addressing a group of people who

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,229
trade and who and many cases have traded

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,240
for years and if you ask somebody

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,000
exactly how do prices get from one price

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,619
to the next they can't tell you they

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,290
don't know they don't know how it

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,380
happens and maybe you guys are I'm sure

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,850
you guys aren't that that group but well

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,590
you know we'll do what we'll go over it

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,840
just as a refresher okay we'll do it as

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,430
a kind of refresher no actually I

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,090
haven't I would address a group yet that

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,460
that there were very few people or if

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,380
anybody could tell you exactly how

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,970
prices move from one price level to the

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,530
next so for an example

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,470
okay if the last reported price that you

40
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,550
see on your screen of something is 10

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,950
how does it get to 11 what who's they

42
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,570
the market maker and market maker asked

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,500
12 okay

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,730
well no well okay it's at 10 how does it

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,370
get to 11 how does the price actually

46
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,010
move to 11

47
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,130
well more buyers but that okay that's

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,030
true but then again when you with that

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,050
demand okay

50
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,950
but when you look at 10 what you have is

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,350
you have offers at 11 and you have bids

52
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,330
at nine right everybody understands that

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,200
okay now there's only two ways that

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,019
anybody can make money in this business

55
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,580
there's only two possible ways no matter

56
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,920
what strategies you're employing no

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,269
matter how elaborate they are no matter

58
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,610
how simple they are you have to be able

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,400
to buy something at a low price and sell

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
it back at a higher price or sell

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,459
something at a high price and buy it

62
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,260
back at a lower price well we in

63
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,260
agreeance on that and would you also

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,030
agree that everyone that trades is

65
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,440
trading to make money in other words I'm

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,299
gonna say that there isn't anybody who

67
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,180
puts on a trade that does so knowingly

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,739
and consciously thinking it's going to

69
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:35,299
be a loser

70
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,200
in other words where they going to the

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,140
mark and say I my purpose is to lose

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,269
money okay you guys with me on this now

73
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,160
if the only way that you can make money

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,320
is to buy low and sell high or sell high

75
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,230
and buy low and the last price posted

76
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,019
price is 10 which represents the value

77
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,340
at that moment then what's low nine is

78
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,329
low and what's high 11 what's the only

79
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,560
way that it can get to 11

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,300
somebody somebody thinks 11

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,830
good price meaning that they have to buy

82
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,360
high relative to the last price right so

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,410
for an exist

84
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,480
so basically what this also means is

85
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,548
that that all the offers have to be

86
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,430
taken out at ten do they not anybody who

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,110
had an offer in at ten that wanted to

88
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,860
sell at ten will get filled and all

89
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,420
those offers have to be taken out for

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,850
the price to go to eleven correct

91
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,920
and of course and for the price to go to

92
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,960
twelve all the offers that exist that at

93
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
eleven have to be taken out so that

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
someone could actually bid the price up

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,870
to twelve for prices to move somebody

96
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,160
literally has to bid the barque it up or

97
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,990
for prices to go lower it means that

98
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,600
someone has to offer it lower now if the

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,430
only way that anyone can make money is

100
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,980
to buy low and sell high and sell high

101
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,260
and buy low why in the world would

102
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,320
anybody bid the market past the last

103
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,190
posted price conviction exactly

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,540
conviction in other words what you have

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,300
is a situation where on every trade

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,850
every trade that exists or a boat there

107
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,290
are two people on both sides of the

108
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,050
trade even in stocks there's even

109
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,850
someone who's selling a stock not like a

110
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,980
commodity where we're in a futures

111
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,320
contract or an options contract there's

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,150
two people on both sides of the trade

113
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,419
there's a buyer and there's a seller and

114
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,740
the next tick is going to make one of

115
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,880
them a winner and one of them a loser

116
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,480
right off the bat if you and I you and I

117
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,450
enter into a trade at ten okay we enter

118
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,230
into a trade at ten it means that you in

119
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,210
essence if you're the seller they'll say

120
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,430
you you sold them at ten and I bought

121
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,919
them at ten the next tick is going to

122
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,540
make one of us a winner and one of us a

123
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,870
loser if the next tick is nine the

124
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,070
amount of money that flows into your

125
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,870
account is coming directly out of mind

126
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,480
are you guys with me on this the next

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,950
tick is eleven the amount of money

128
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,360
flowing into my account is coming

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,960
directly out of your account okay so

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,970
basically what you have is you have two

131
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,840
diametrically opposed again to every

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,800
single trade every trade that is made

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,410
there are diametrically opposed Ivelisse

134
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,249
about what the few

135
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,629
sure is going to be so again I'm going

136
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,069
to say what would cause anybody to buy

137
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,779
high or sell low just conviction in

138
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,309
other words what you have is a situation

139
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,799
where if someone's willing to bid a

140
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,069
market up to the next highest price

141
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,449
basically what that person is doing is

142
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,749
that person is stepping out saying that

143
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,269
my conviction that the price is going to

144
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,389
go to 12 or beyond is so great that I am

145
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,929
willing to do the opposite of what I

146
00:06:57,929 --> 00:06:59,969
need to do to make money think about

147
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:02,309
what I just said I am willing to do the

148
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,959
opposite of what I need to do to make

149
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,509
money because my conviction is so strong

150
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,059
that the next price will be 12 or 13

151
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,459
otherwise this person would wait if this

152
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:12,689
person thought the next price is going

153
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,699
to be 9 then they buy lower what they

154
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,019
thought was going to be 8 they'd buy low

155
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,399
they'd wait and buy lower whereas so

156
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,049
what happens is that the person who's

157
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:24,389
willing to bid a market up and take out

158
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,729
these offers at 10 take out all the

159
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,869
offers at 10 and bid it up to 11 has to

160
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:33,029
have a stronger conviction in the future

161
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,769
than the person who sold it to him at 11

162
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,869
because this person is creating price

163
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,119
movement is actually creating movement

164
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,769
and the person on the other side of the

165
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:44,069
trade is being passive because they're

166
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,419
doing exactly what they think they need

167
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,129
to do and that sell high relative to the

168
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,539
last price are you guys with me on this

169
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,259
okay everybody understand it now when I

170
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,299
ask you is there anybody in this room

171
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:01,129
who has purposefully bid up a market

172
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,419
there are there are some people who have

173
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,919
actually been a market up in other words

174
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,539
the people who've actually taken taken

175
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,249
the offers all the offers out at the

176
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:14,009
next highest price and bid it up do

177
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,579
people like that exist yes that so no we

178
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,839
are aware of the fact that there are

179
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,029
traders who have both who both have the

180
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,259
financial and the psychological

181
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,829
resources to actually purposefully bid

182
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,909
markets up or offer them lower we're

183
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,159
together on this right okay

184
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,720
so basically what you have is that all

185
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,750
price movement has to be a result of an

186
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,370
imbalance in the degree of conviction

187
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,900
between the traders who believe that

188
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,000
prices are going up and those who

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,920
believe that it's going down that is the

190
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,050
only way that prices move it doesn't

191
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,850
matter what the reasons are that people

192
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,350
tell you about why they did what they

193
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,120
did or it doesn't matter what the

194
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,060
reasons that you hear on CNBC or

195
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,920
whatever about where the market is and

196
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,380
why it went the way that it went

197
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,240
ultimately it all boils down to an

198
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,850
imbalance in conviction that's the only

199
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,280
way prices can move because the only way

200
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,760
they can move is for someone to actually

201
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,620
purposefully bid it up or offer it lower

202
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,820
and for them to do it there has to be

203
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,720
you know like like a sense of strength

204
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,090
in terms of energy in their belief that

205
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,770
the next tick is going to make them a

206
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,010
winner

207
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,840
okay so we're basically does everybody

208
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,279
understand everyone's with me on this

209
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,440
all price movement is a result of an

210
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,180
imbalance in conviction between the

211
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,760
buyers and the sellers every trade every

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,410
trade that's made there's somebody on

213
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,730
both sides of the trade that have

214
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,930
diametrically opposed

215
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,820
you're always having it with every

216
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,260
single trade there's always a clash

217
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,330
there's always a clash in wheels and a

218
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,370
clash and belief in terms of what the

219
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,510
next tick is going to be or what the

220
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,790
future holds we've got two people coming

221
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,279
entering into in a sense an agreement by

222
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,410
making a trade but both of those people

223
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,690
have diametrically opposed expectations

224
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,960
of the future and one of them is willing

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,900
to say hey you know what my expectation

226
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,690
is so great is so strong that I am

227
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,339
actually willing to do the opposite of

228
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,950
what I need to do to make money and get

229
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,250
a mark it up now there are traders who

230
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,910
will do that

231
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,330
I call them dynamic traders they are the

232
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,339
people that have like I said both the

233
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,900
financial and the psychological

234
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,350
resources to actually bid markets up

235
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,450
what the typical and what I'm going to

236
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,300
call everyone else passive technical

237
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,510
traders okay they've got dynamic traders

238
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,680
and passive technical traders what the

239
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
typical passive technical trader doesn't

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,540
really I'd say really not a where ever

241
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,550
think about is the fact that the only

242
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,290
way that they will find themselves in a

243
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,310
winning trade is by the actions of the

244
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,780
people who are willing to bid a market

245
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,910
up an offer will offer at lower that's

246
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,710
the only way that it happens in other

247
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,990
words when you and I get into a train I

248
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,820
am a passive technical trader by the way

249
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,170
I'm not one of these dynamic guys I

250
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,310
don't bid markets up an offer lower okay

251
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,089
that when you and I get into a trade at

252
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,770
this price right here let's say we got

253
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,860
to move ought at seven we're buyers at

254
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,870
seven what are we really saying when we

255
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,839
get into that trade bottom line what are

256
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,540
we saying based on the dynamics of what

257
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,270
I just explained we're saying that I

258
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,060
think that someone is going to come into

259
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,089
the market after E and buy at a worse

260
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,370
price and what I did

261
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,140
so that has such a strong conviction

262
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,510
that this market is going to go up that

263
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,279
that person is actually willing to buy

264
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,940
at a worse price than me to buy it eight

265
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,040
to buy it nine to buy it ten because if

266
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,540
there isn't anybody else that comes into

267
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,310
the market to take out all the offers at

268
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,630
eight take all the offers at nine take

269
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,460
out all the offers at ten that market

270
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,800
ain't going up and I'm not gonna be in a

271
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,190
winning trade you see the implications

272
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,560
are every single trade that we put on as

273
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,839
packed as passive technical traders we

274
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,540
are in fact obliged and dependent on

275
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,640
other people who are willing to do

276
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,990
something at a worse price than what

277
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,540
we've done it we did it at oh we will be

278
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,210
a winner are you guys following me on

279
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,730
this is it starting to put the idea of

280
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,170
trading into a different context that in

281
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,610
essence what you're really trading is

282
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,930
other people's perception of what is

283
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,170
high and what is low that any technical

284
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,240
indicator any price pattern that you

285
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,670
might trade any trade that you put on

286
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,310
you are basically trading other people's

287
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,200
perceptions of what is high and what is

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,339
low now when you think about how well

289
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,930
you might know other people's

290
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,240
perceptions you think about in that

291
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,040
context it might not make a lot of sense

292
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
to get so fixated on staying in a train

293
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,550
that isn't working it might be a little

294
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,100
easier to put in a stop and to say hey

295
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,250
you know what if they if these if people

296
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,050
aren't coming in to buy it a higher

297
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,420
price than me I'm gonna give them this

298
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,850
much room from here to here and if they

299
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,320
don't come in I'm out of this trade I

300
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,420
just go to the next one because that's

301
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,800
basically what you're doing is a trader

302
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,540
you are completely dependent on other

303
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,950
two other traders to make you a winner

304
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,720
now who are these dynamic traders who

305
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,770
are the people that are going to do this

306
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,900
and why

307
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,520
what hedge funds okay money managers in

308
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,750
the commodities arena

309
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,329
do you guys really know how like the

310
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:01,740
futures markets he was started in the

311
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,310
first place

312
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,200
or why'd they even exist

313
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,450
I know people probably exist because

314
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,190
there on the screen and it's part of the

315
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,720
platform but you know there's actually a

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
legitimate economic purpose for these

317
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,680
things and when you get to the

318
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,330
underlying and I would understand the

319
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,460
underlying reason for these markets

320
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,680
you'll understand why they trade the way

321
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,060
that they do and why prices move the way

322
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,080
that they do you know for an example

323
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,120
what you know what really what what what

324
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,130
happened in the past is that a for an

325
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,450
example if you had a farmer who you know

326
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,700
who planted their their their corn in

327
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,280
the spring and harvested the corn in the

328
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,440
fall what they were dependent on of

329
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,790
course was a lot of different factors

330
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,290
that they had no control of one of them

331
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,850
being the weather and one of them being

332
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,470
how much other how much other corn was

333
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,030
planted out throughout the country and

334
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,490
how much that corn would end up end up

335
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,440
in in the market in the fall in

336
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,050
relationship to what the demand was so

337
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,510
if there was a lot of corn and and and

338
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,870
let's say the demand remained relatively

339
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,760
constant the price of the corn would go

340
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,130
down and the farmer would lose money if

341
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,810
there wasn't a lot of corn and demand

342
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,100
would remain constant the price would go

343
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,170
up if there wasn't a lot of corn and for

344
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,550
some reason demand was really high and

345
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,070
the price would go up even further so

346
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,630
what you had is a situation where there

347
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,490
was a great deal of economic risk in

348
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,190
being a farmer or being anybody that

349
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,800
manufactured anything or abduch stuff

350
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,590
out of the ground like gold or silver or

351
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,640
manufactured electric motors that needed

352
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,290
copper or whatever goes into all the

353
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,040
products that we use so what what

354
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,610
evolved was a situation where the the

355
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,100
farmer and the and the manufacturer

356
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,570
let's say a bread that needed the flour

357
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,700
they would enter into what was called a

358
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,910
forward agreement meaning that they both

359
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,830
wanted the economic risks taken out of

360
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,540
their business they both wanted to be

361
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,910
able to make a profit they both wanted

362
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,800
you know to be able to have some sense

363
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,220
of certainty as to what prices might be

364
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,500
at some point in the future so for

365
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,880
example if if I'm a farmer and it cost

366
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,490
me $4 a bushel to plant my corn and

367
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,900
bring it to harvest or bring it to

368
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,480
market then for me to force me to make

369
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,950
some money I want at least five dollars

370
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,190
a bushel right

371
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,260
and if I'm the guy on the other end of

372
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,550
that trade or other end of that

373
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,010
transaction that wants to buy that corn

374
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,330
in the fall or wheat or whatever and I

375
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,920
want to know exactly how much I'm going

376
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,290
to have to pay for it so what ends up

377
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,240
happening is that if let's say it's it's

378
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,910
April or its it's March and the price of

379
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,910
corn is $4 a bushel you enter to a

380
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,190
forward agreement with with the with the

381
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,380
end user and they say hey you know what

382
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,260
I will deliver a million dollars of our

383
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,670
million bushels of corn or a hundred

384
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,250
thousand bushels of corn and say 450 a

385
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,690
bushel or whether a price they agreed on

386
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,700
five dollars a bushel regardless of what

387
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,180
the price of corn is in the fall so if

388
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,860
the price of corn in the fall happens to

389
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,140
be three dollars a bushel because

390
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,369
there's so much demand or because

391
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,839
there's because there's so much corn and

392
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,490
very little demand then the farmer

393
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,800
actually still got his price and let's

394
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,380
say five dollars a bushel but the but

395
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,540
the manufacturer ended up having to pay

396
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,980
two dollars a bushel more than what he

397
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,900
would have if he had waited and just

398
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,339
bought his corn on the open market in

399
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,130
the fall so in that sense he seemed to

400
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,170
lose on that transaction but then the

401
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,000
next year what ends up happening is that

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,220
there's very little corn or there's more

403
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,140
demand than what there is corn and the

404
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,520
price of corn ends up being seven

405
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,430
dollars a bushel and the farmer would

406
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,690
have made the seven dollars had he not

407
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,150
or entered into a ford agreement but

408
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,770
what ends up happening is he still made

409
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,740
his dollar bushel profit and the and the

410
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,570
end user ended up saving himself two

411
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,420
dollars a bushel so over the years all

412
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,120
this evens out well so then what

413
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,580
happened then is that exchanges in other

414
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,110
words instead of these these people

415
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,550
individually entering into these

416
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,680
transactions exchanges were developed so

417
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,270
in other words they had a central place

418
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,170
to come to and make these transactions

419
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,700
like the Chicago Board of Trade Chicago

420
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,570
Mercantile Exchange

421
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,640
well what ended up happening is that

422
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
when with the advent of exchanges which

423
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,900
you had of the situation where there

424
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,880
were people that were willing to take

425
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,070
the other sides of these trades that had

426
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,590
nothing to do with the actual process of

427
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,800
making bread or growing wheat or corn

428
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,590
they were called speculators and then

429
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,330
that's when futures are futures

430
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,470
contracts

431
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,690
came into being so what would happen is

432
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,870
that is that if I'm if I'm a farmer

433
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,460
instead of me having to make the

434
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,630
transaction directly with a with someone

435
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,720
who manufactures bread I could go to the

436
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,210
Chicago Board of Trade and sell my corn

437
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,900
or wheat in with a futures contract and

438
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,700
so if I'm selling it at four dollars a

439
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,690
bushel and so that means I'm long corn

440
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,919
this is where the long and the short

441
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,799
comes from I am long cash I'm long corn

442
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,799
and because I've got a crop and crop in

443
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,970
the ground and so if if I sell it at

444
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,320
four dollars a bushel on a futures

445
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,549
contract I think the equivalent number

446
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,309
of futures contracts and so if the price

447
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,630
of corn goes down but let's say the

448
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,460
price of corn goes up I've already

449
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,690
locked in well I'm gonna sell at five

450
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,770
dollars but I've locked in my dollar

451
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,840
bushel profit so if the price of corn

452
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,929
goes up what I've done is I'm short

453
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,909
futures I'm short the actual futures

454
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,669
contract I'm long the corn so I'm gonna

455
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,820
lose money on my futures contract

456
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,380
because as the price goes up I'm losing

457
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,710
money but I'm making money on my cash so

458
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,970
I'm making the equivalent amount of

459
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,059
money on my cash as well what I'm losing

460
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,130
on my futures so in any case it doesn't

461
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,049
matter what the market does the market

462
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,940
could go up the market can go down I've

463
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,799
locked in my dollar profit bushel but

464
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,799
dollar per bushel profit and the person

465
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,059
on the other side of that trade the

466
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,970
speculator if of course the market goes

467
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,340
up then the speculator is the one that

468
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,840
makes that two dollars a bushel profit

469
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,440
if it goes up to seven dollars a bushel

470
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,419
okay these guys with me on all this if

471
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,330
the price of course the price of of it

472
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,970
goes down then I'm losing money I'm

473
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,610
losing money on my cash crop but I'm

474
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,500
making money on my futures contract and

475
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,630
the speculator on the other side of the

476
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,210
contract is losing money because the

477
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,530
markets going down in other words the

478
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,840
speculator is just one-sided this the

479
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,580
farmers two-sided he is hedged that's

480
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,669
what's that's what's called a hedge now

481
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,740
what's interesting about all this is

482
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,460
that is that as these markets evolved

483
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,399
you will find that that the farmers

484
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,530
don't trade against each other

485
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,380
or the grain elevators or the people who

486
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,270
the commercials who actually are

487
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,440
involved with the production and

488
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,390
manufacture of anything they don't take

489
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,630
the other side of each other's trades

490
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,660
what they do is they want speculators to

491
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,050
take the other sides of their trades in

492
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,060
other words if I'm a if I'm a commercial

493
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,350
grain elevator I'm not going to be that

494
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,240
I'm another commercial grain elevators

495
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,350
not going to be taking the other side of

496
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,220
my trade because we're both going to be

497
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,560
doing the same thing okay if I'm a

498
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,860
farmer and I'm gonna sell sell my wheat

499
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,350
or sell my corn the guy the farmer down

500
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,060
the street who also trades isn't going

501
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,840
to be taking the other side of my trains

502
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,770
what what commercials and hedgers and

503
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,130
fund managers and all the people who are

504
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,590
really let's say professionals they have

505
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,590
become very very sophisticated at

506
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,260
finding ways of drawing the general

507
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,840
public into taking the other size of

508
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,870
their trades meaning in the point that

509
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,330
I'm making here is that they will

510
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,260
purposefully do things that will draw

511
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,860
the typical general public let's say the

512
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,180
general public into the other side of

513
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,460
their trades when in fact what they want

514
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,590
to do is the exact opposite for an

515
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,200
example let's if I'm if I'm a hedge fund

516
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,300
if I'm a hedge fund manager and I want

517
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,250
to and I'm long stocks or or it doesn't

518
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,480
really matter what it is I could be long

519
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,820
bonds I could be long a goal that could

520
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,770
be whatever it is and I want to and I

521
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,070
want to liquidate my position now I've

522
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,400
got a huge position meaning I've got a

523
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,940
cash position and I want to sell it if I

524
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,010
go into the market right now and sell my

525
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,800
entire position what do you think is

526
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,560
gonna happen to the price chances are

527
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,880
it's gonna go down I'm gonna I am

528
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,500
actually good at because of the volume

529
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,230
of my trades I am actually going to

530
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,410
drive the price down making my average

531
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,650
cost lower and lower I don't want to do

532
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,380
that I don't want a so for example if I

533
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,940
come into the market and I say hey you

534
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,610
know what I've got 10 million shares of

535
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,179
this and

536
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,679
not to sell what's going to end up

537
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,999
happening is that those 10 million

538
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,679
shares are going to end up taking out

539
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,899
all the bids all the way all the prices

540
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,279
down take out all the bids until you

541
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,139
find a spot where it can't take out

542
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:11,080
where the sides of the trade cannot take

543
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,340
out any more bids and the price

544
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,159
stabilizes okay so I'm thinking to

545
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,559
myself now what you get is you've got

546
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,940
these what I'm going to call like these

547
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,269
these hotshot hotshot kind of hardcore

548
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,029
traders where you know to make a name

549
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:30,220
for themselves because they're in a

550
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,690
they're in a big trading room and they

551
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,490
they compete amongst one another and

552
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,190
their bonuses depend on how well they do

553
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,809
what they're gonna be what if what if

554
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:38,860
they did something like this I'm looking

555
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,159
at a price chart let's just say they

556
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,580
could be Daly bars or whatever okay and

557
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,440
this is like a swing high swing low okay

558
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,450
now interestingly enough as we're

559
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,619
talking about this I want to make a

560
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,179
point about what does this what does

561
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,889
this price represent right here and what

562
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,710
does this price represent right here

563
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,509
what yeah we're going to call it

564
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,309
resistance but but but more from a

565
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,409
practical matter what does it represent

566
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,600
what's that ah yeah in other words there

567
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,759
wasn't no you're right he said he said

568
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,899
there's nobody believed is going to go

569
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,330
higher it represents there wasn't one

570
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,309
person in the whole world in the whole

571
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:33,039
world that was willing to bid it bid the

572
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,419
price one tick higher not one up to this

573
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:39,970
point there could be any number of

574
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,379
people who were willing to bid it higher

575
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,980
but it got to a certain price level and

576
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,749
there wasn't one person left in the

577
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:50,519
whole world that would bid it higher

578
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,799
this by the way is one of the reasons

579
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,440
why technical analysis works is because

580
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,460
the market has a memory this is why

581
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,980
technical analysis works the market has

582
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,750
because when the market came back down

583
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,210
he formed a swing low came back up to

584
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,450
this high there were people there were

585
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,420
people who made money by selling this

586
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,200
high there's a good chance those same

587
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,490
traders are gonna come back into the

588
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,380
market and do it again as well as there

589
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,270
are people who lost money by buying that

590
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,340
high because for every trade that was

591
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,560
made up to this last price there was a

592
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,350
buyer and a seller there was a trader on

593
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,600
the other end of the trade that sold

594
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,720
that bought that high

595
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,580
now when the market comes back again to

596
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,340
this to the same price level chances are

597
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,320
there will be an imbalance between the

598
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,600
buyers and the sellers just by the mere

599
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,460
fact that the people who made money are

600
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,140
going to be willing to trade it again

601
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,750
and come into the market maybe with with

602
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,150
a lot of ferocity and the traders who

603
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,030
lost money by buying that high are

604
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,590
probably not going to be willing to do

605
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,680
it again and so what you have is even

606
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,390
more of an imbalance that existed the

607
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:08,530
last time are you guys with me on this

608
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,750
okay well that's fine you can do that

609
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,970
however now I'm not gonna really get on

610
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,110
to the most I'm gonna do is get into

611
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,250
what we're just doing right now because

612
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,110
this is not you know this is not a

613
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,730
course in technical analysis I mean that

614
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,770
and it doesn't really matter anyway

615
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,000
because you guys are trading off on

616
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,280
mathematical formulas and and not doing

617
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,990
subjective trading so and this would

618
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,340
fall into the category of subjective

619
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,500
trading subjective trading also is is

620
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,160
the equivalent to like like who watches

621
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,260
Texas Hold'em tournaments I like on TV

622
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,720
anybody come on give me more of a show

623
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,790
of so so you've got so you've got

624
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,590
categories of development where we're

625
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,210
initially people when when they play

626
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,890
Texas Hold'em you play your cards and

627
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,720
then you get well enough and get good

628
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,770
enough of playing your cards but you

629
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,120
start doing is playing the people and

630
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,890
you get good enough you get so good that

631
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,000
you don't even have to play your cards

632
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,260
you need to look at your cards just play

633
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,390
the person that's the equivalents of

634
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,190
subjective trading okay what you're

635
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,620
doing is you're using a process of

636
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,410
deductive reasoning to determine who's

637
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,910
thinking what and what they're likely to

638
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,080
do okay and all the only reason I'm

639
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,090
giving you all this information and

640
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,770
making this point is so that you

641
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,040
understand

642
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,830
with no uncertain terms that there are

643
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,440
as a whole category of traders out there

644
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,890
people out there traders people who have

645
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,750
both the financial and the psychological

646
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,730
resources the bid markets up an offer

647
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,770
from lower and what's the point that I'm

648
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,660
making the point that I'm making is that

649
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,630
any particular technical methodology

650
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,690
that you use to determine a pattern is

651
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,670
present that gives you a higher

652
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,140
probability of one thing happening over

653
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,270
another until you can get into the minds

654
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,130
of the people who actually move prices

655
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,480
you will never know for sure what's

656
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,850
going to happen next the only people

657
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,050
that know for sure the people who are

658
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,860
willing to do it and that's what you've

659
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,330
got to get you got to burn that in your

660
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,600
brain you will never know for sure

661
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,140
what's going to happen next unless you

662
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,940
can read the minds of the people who are

663
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,250
going to do it and there are people who

664
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,020
will do it and they do it all the time

665
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,760
that's the only way you end up in a

666
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,130
winning trade most of the time when you

667
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,660
end up in a winning trade is because of

668
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,550
what these other dynamic traders are

669
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,430
doing so to convince you that there are

670
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,100
people who are willing to do this if I'm

671
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,720
a hedge fund manager and I've got to

672
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,600
unload if I've got to unload a huge

673
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,460
position and the market happens to be

674
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,590
sitting right here in relative to this

675
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,810
chart pattern how might I maximize my

676
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,950
profits what might I do now remember

677
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,960
I've got a sell I'm going to be a seller

678
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,330
but what might I do to make sure that I

679
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,580
get the best price what yeah drive it up

680
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,010
in other words I will do the opposite of

681
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,410
what I want to do to get a better price

682
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,780
and I will drive it up but how much risk

683
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,950
am i taking by doing that

684
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,440
well yeah I mean if I Drive the price up

685
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
by taking out these offers and then

686
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,460
bidding up taking out it off taking

687
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,080
other words I can look with with

688
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,369
depending on the kind of software I have

689
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:17,980
I can find out what depth the depth of

690
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,990
the market meaning that that you know

691
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,490
and I'm not saying these are hard hard

692
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,529
offers because people pull their offers

693
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,149
all the time but I can look at this I

694
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:26,259
can look at this hi and I say you know

695
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:30,190
what what if how much money might it

696
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,840
take for me to drive the market from

697
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,970
here to just pass these highs right here

698
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,470
how many offers do I have to take out to

699
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,509
do it just tally it up and see if you

700
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,759
want to spend the money because in

701
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,139
essence so how much risk you actually

702
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:51,009
taking see by by by driving it up what

703
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:52,720
you're doing is you're you're increasing

704
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,499
the asset value of your portfolio so in

705
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,850
that sense you're not taking any risk

706
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,299
you're actually making money if I if I

707
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,289
continue to drive the price up I am

708
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:07,570
actually making the trade that I made

709
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,999
down here winners every tick that I

710
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,740
drive the price up I'm making myself a

711
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,659
winner on the trades that I made at

712
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,179
lower prices to actually drive a price

713
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:17,740
up because you are making yourself a

714
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,779
winner at the prices that you know what

715
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,879
you bought out in lower prices if for an

716
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:24,700
example by me driving this price up it

717
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,509
draws other people into the market that

718
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,100
will help will it not because it creates

719
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,879
more of an imbalance now that's the real

720
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,529
thing what I want to do is I want to get

721
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,999
more buyers into the market and the

722
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,139
reason why I want to get more buyers

723
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,929
into the market is so somebody is there

724
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,940
to take the other side of my sell orders

725
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,769
because that's ultimately what I'm doing

726
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:48,249
here what I'm doing is I want to sell so

727
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,230
what I'm doing is creating a bigger pool

728
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,369
of orders to come into the market to I

729
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,590
could sell into so that I might my sell

730
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,549
orders don't drive the price down down

731
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:03,100
and so I will purposefully do the

732
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,470
opposite of what I want to do ultimately

733
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,509
with which back to my position now what

734
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,159
the reason why I'm selling has nothing

735
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,470
to do with this chart pattern absolutely

736
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,940
nothing to do with the chart pattern

737
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,100
itself I'm just using the chart pattern

738
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,950
as a means to maximize

739
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,120
my profits now what if I managed to

740
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,080
drive it up to resistance chances are

741
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,980
there's going to be a lot of selling

742
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,149
orders coming in that I'm gonna have to

743
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,760
compete with that's that's a risk that I

744
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,919
that's a risk that I'm taking here but

745
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,740
what if I can drive it a little past

746
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,919
that resistance what I'm gonna have is a

747
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,320
situation where all the people the other

748
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,450
traders who sold at this level right

749
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,820
here that came into the market because

750
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,399
it was approaching this previous high

751
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,480
they're gonna put their stops a little

752
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,950
bit above the market know what kind of

753
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,059
stops are they gonna be they're going to

754
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,240
be buy stops if they sold to get out at

755
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,639
a loss they have to be buyers if I can

756
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,970
drive the market to those buy stops I

757
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,519
have given myself an instant pool an

758
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,639
instant pool of orders to take the other

759
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,340
side of my trades and and get me out at

760
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,190
maximum profits this is typically what

761
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,750
you see in a chart pattern is a false

762
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,600
breakout because what will end up

763
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,580
happening is that as soon as my order

764
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,799
hits the market it's so large and and

765
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,809
then because there really weren't that

766
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,279
many other traders that we're willing to

767
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,720
bid continue to bid the market up

768
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,580
what'll do it it'll take out all the

769
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,230
bids and then drive the price right down

770
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,950
that's called a false breakout it's it's

771
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,980
being done at different different time

772
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,309
frames all of the time to do this you

773
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,169
have to have a large enough position so

774
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,090
that when you drive up your cost basis

775
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,130
it's incrementally small compared to

776
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,220
where you really are today and then as

777
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,500
you said you get up to either you do it

778
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,149
below that resistance hope you break

779
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,950
above and then you just dump your shares

780
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,309
right right thank you

781
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:08,909
now like I said this is well did anybody

782
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:14,189
ever wonder why like like you you have a

783
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,749
really strong bull market or a really

784
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,789
strong bear market and the market seems

785
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,439
to open up in the morning like in bull

786
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:21,299
markets that opens lower and bear market

787
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,929
opens higher let that happen well what's

788
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:26,279
the deal with that what do you think's

789
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,549
going on

790
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,589
you ever heard the term shaking out the

791
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,139
weak lungs and the weak shorts that's

792
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,669
what that's what that's what dynamic

793
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:37,079
traders are doing they're shaking out

794
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,059
the weak Long's in the weak shorts in

795
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,079
other words they're taking their spot

796
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,119
because what you have in a bull market

797
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,669
is you have you know people that feels

798
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:46,049
the markets going up because this is

799
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,729
this is a daily bar but if we made it an

800
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,829
intraday bar or whatever as a market is

801
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,919
going up they're buying people are

802
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,509
buying but they're not they're not like

803
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,719
really confident about what it is that

804
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,269
they're doing now in the morning before

805
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:03,869
the market opens there might not be that

806
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,329
many bids in other words if though after

807
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,619
the market opens they'll be more bids

808
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,418
that come into the market but before the

809
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:10,710
market opens there might not be that

810
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,379
many bids so what so if there aren't

811
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,569
what these dynamic traders did we'll do

812
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:17,489
to take advantage of this is they'll hit

813
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,779
those bids now in other words they'll

814
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:21,899
sell they'll sell into those bids drive

815
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,179
the market down and then when the market

816
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,998
opens up all of the weak longs meaning

817
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,039
people who aren't that confident well

818
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,539
will start to it will start to get a

819
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:33,059
little frightened and to get out of

820
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,349
their position what do they have to do

821
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:35,969
they have to sell and these other

822
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,559
dynamic traders will take the other side

823
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,268
of their sell orders to buy and increase

824
00:34:39,268 --> 00:34:40,949
their position and the market goes right

825
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,379
straight back up all they did was shake

826
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,719
these guys out take their spot at lower

827
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,119
prices by by by forcing the market lower

828
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,690
on the open

829
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,440
isn't this an argument to have a Vig to

830
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,260
either not use let's talk no no no it is

831
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,940
not no I don't want to get I don't want

832
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,890
to get into user not you absolutely you

833
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,350
stops I'm not gonna no we're not gonna

834
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,740
get into that we're yes you can achill

835
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,480
passive technical traders in the

836
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,990
mechanical mode this is not in any way

837
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,400
saying that you should not use stops

838
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,460
absolutely it's a disastrous thing to do

839
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,980
not you stops okay because I'm not

840
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,810
saying that regardless of any of this

841
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,330
that you can't make money you I'm giving

842
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,490
all I'm doing is giving you examples

843
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,310
that there are people out there who will

844
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,740
drive prices up and offer them lower

845
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,660
that they have the psychological and

846
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,820
financial resources to do it and the

847
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,470
reason why I'm spending you know making

848
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,270
so much emphasis is that the passive

849
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,730
typically the passive typical passive

850
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,010
technical trader would never conceive of

851
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,380
actually bidding a market up and so as a

852
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,150
result it's very difficult for you to

853
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,530
think that anyone else can do it either

854
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,780
when the reality is that's the only way

855
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,750
in many cases you're gonna make money

856
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,420
and so the point that I'm making is that

857
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,100
what you you're trading off of a

858
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,680
mathematical formula literally you're

859
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,480
trading you're in this mathematical

860
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
formula what technical analysis does is

861
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,190
it gets into the collective mind of the

862
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,620
market in other words every tick every

863
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,120
uptick and every down tick is

864
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,430
information that information is

865
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,920
accumulated and mathematical principles

866
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,050
are applied to it there are there are

867
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,980
actual patterns that that that emerge

868
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,380
that repeat themselves over and over and

869
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,950
over again that you can identify with

870
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,410
mathematical formulas or with these

871
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,080
visual price patterns but the problem is

872
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,970
is that there's no mathematical formula

873
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,200
that can get into the mind of the

874
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,390
individual traders who actually are

875
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,630
driving prices up or offering a blower

876
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,280
but if you don't know that you somehow

877
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,650
or another if you happen to if you're

878
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,640
trading on a smaller time frame you're

879
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,590
trading on a smaller time frame and you

880
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,140
get a little a little pullback right

881
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,750
here okay and based on that pullback

882
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,420
your methodology says okay it's time to

883
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,830
buy and you do and but and you do it

884
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,870
just before this

885
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,610
fund manager comes in and starts driving

886
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,460
the price up see you're gonna think that

887
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,680
the reason why you won is because that

888
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,600
your mathematical formula told you what

889
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,310
was happening next and that was the

890
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,370
reason why it happened what I'm saying

891
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,130
to you now is that there almost isn't

892
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,110
any reason that you could come up with

893
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,180
whether you won or lost that would

894
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,800
correspond to what really happened in

895
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,290
the market you hear what I just said

896
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,810
there's almost no reason that you will

897
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,790
come up with to put on a trade that will

898
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,860
ever correspond with the actual reason

899
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,240
why the market went up or the market

900
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,430
went down other than the fact that there

901
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,870
was an imbalance and conviction between

902
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,800
buyers and sellers because the people

903
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,380
who do this will not tell you unless

904
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,200
it's in their best interest to do so

905
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,200
and the reason and the people who report

906
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,540
it in the news agencies they don't know

907
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,060
either they're making it up they make up

908
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,380
the reasons because they sound

909
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,840
reasonable they are paid to sound

910
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,700
reasonable and there's no way to verify

911
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:19,810
what it is that they say that's right

912
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,940
there's no there's no way the only

913
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,350
people who can do it are the people who

914
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,960
actually made the trades the only people

915
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,790
who know for sure what's gonna happen

916
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,320
next are the ones who are willing to

917
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,620
make it happen you see will put on a

918
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,260
trade and find ourselves in a lace

919
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,120
monster little winner here and think oh

920
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,680
man my methodology it is just fantastic

921
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,210
and then the next time you get the same

922
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,460
signal and then you don't get anything

923
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,930
not only then it's a loser you think oh

924
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,340
now you feel betrayed you think your

925
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,050
your your methodology let you down

926
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,870
your methodology wasn't designed to tell

927
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,250
you what's gonna happen next on a trade

928
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,070
by trade basis no technical methodology

929
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:07,240
is that's where your expectations are

930
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,890
not in line with the reality of the

931
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,800
situation that's why it's so easy to

932
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,810
make mistakes is because you're

933
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,040
expecting something from your

934
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,140
methodology that just doesn't exist it

935
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,200
just doesn't it never did

936
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,599
and a trade by trade basis they will

937
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,550
tell you what will happen let's say I

938
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,630
don't want to use their words to happen

939
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,490
next they'll tell you what will happen

940
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,829
over a series of trades on a percentage

941
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:39,119
basis this particular pattern will

942
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,640
emerge X number of times and when it

943
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,140
does there's a higher probability of

944
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,960
this happening than that if I limit my

945
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,730
risk when I take the trade and my

946
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,460
profits in my profit potential is at

947
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,290
least you know one or two or three times

948
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,790
greater than what I need the risk then

949
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,920
over a series of trades I will be a

950
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
consistent winner

951
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
that's what trading is all about guys is

952
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,390
the passive technical trader unless

953
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,859
you're doing this other stuff I just

954
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,930
said it right then and there I said it

955
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,589
all right then and there there was a guy

956
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,290
that I that I guy that came to me for

957
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:17,060
consultations several years ago he was a

958
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,800
it was really anything he was he was a

959
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,060
guy that yeah he was a guy that lost a

960
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,869
lot of people's money

961
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,200
he was basically what he was he he he

962
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,250
was actually he was really good an

963
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,560
analyst I should say really he was an

964
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,359
excellent an aspect as far as far as

965
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,800
Margaret analysis was concerned he's

966
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,230
probably one of the best analysts I'd

967
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,150
ever worked with but the problem is that

968
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,430
he had some really as far as executing

969
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,700
his trades and and let's put it this way

970
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,160
he was let's say on the arrogant side

971
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,810
and that's and that's and that's that's

972
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,060
being that's being nice

973
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,940
and so when he put on a trade he just

974
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,230
thought that that was it you know the

975
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,400
mark was gonna do what he thought I was

976
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,369
gonna do period so he was a kind of guy

977
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,230
who you know he he went through all of

978
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,390
his relatives money with trading

979
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,920
accounts and his friends and that sort

980
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,060
of thing and his getting the point was

981
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,700
really exasperated so he came to me for

982
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,140
consultations and basically after

983
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,490
listening to him I said hey you know

984
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,829
what why don't you do something get paid

985
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:15,329
for something that you're good at and

986
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,160
you know and stop trying to you know

987
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,930
stop losing other people's money and go

988
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,450
get a job as an analyst just get paid to

989
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,609
be an analyst not as a trader and so he

990
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,440
did he got a job with a with one of the

991
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,329
major clearing firms that's a Chicago

992
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,119
Board of Trade as one of their analysts

993
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,500
for their brokers and that sort of thing

994
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,140
and the president are they actually the

995
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,640
chairman of the board he was his son was

996
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,810
actually the president he

997
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,980
chairman had retired he was an old-time

998
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,830
grain trader soy bean trader and you

999
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,240
know made his money in the 40s and the

1000
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,530
50s and that sort of thing

1001
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,170
and and traded Pitts style trading in

1002
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,280
other words it's something that I talked

1003
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,540
about early this morning I'm not gonna

1004
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,760
get into but in any case he didn't make

1005
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,180
Direction related traits and so the so

1006
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,360
he was really mystified with this with

1007
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,460
the idea of technical analysis I mean he

1008
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,780
really was he was literally mystified

1009
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,250
with the idea that you could basically

1010
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,260
predict prices based on chart patterns

1011
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,210
and that sort of thing so he thought

1012
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,500
well you know what I'm gonna sit down

1013
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,960
with this guy and you know this this

1014
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,640
star analyst here that we have in the

1015
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,200
firm now and find out what this with

1016
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,870
what this crap is all about basically

1017
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,590
the way he thought about it and so he's

1018
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,380
sitting down with him for a few days and

1019
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,530
it got to a point where one day the the

1020
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:35,100
soybean market was the soybean market

1021
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,070
was was basically you know trading in a

1022
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,330
range about the middle of a range

1023
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,370
between what the analysts projected as

1024
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,440
the high of the day not just the high

1025
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,200
the high the day and the low of the day

1026
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,440
okay and so the market drifted around

1027
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,750
you know or you maybe did a little bit

1028
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,430
of a coast to a test of the high and

1029
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,050
it's coming down to the coming down to

1030
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,850
the low and they're both sitting there

1031
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,150
and they're both watching it right now

1032
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,520
and the the chairman of the board the

1033
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,960
soybean trader old scientist Lubbock

1034
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,750
trader says ok so this is gonna be the

1035
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,940
low of the day right here right guy said

1036
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,410
yeah that's it gets that price it's the

1037
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,530
low of the day low of the day and the

1038
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,020
guy looked at me and said that's bull

1039
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,060
and he picked up the phone which he had

1040
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,400
a direct line to the soybean pit he said

1041
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,850
sell 10 million beans at the market now

1042
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,130
10 million beans is 2 thousand contracts

1043
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,510
cuz they trained five thousand five

1044
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,060
thousand bushel increments so he hit the

1045
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,570
market at that moment with two thousand

1046
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,940
sell orders okay which drove the

1047
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,440
immediately drove the price down 10

1048
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,800
cents which makes arisen is a million

1049
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,500
dollar trade by the way you drive the

1050
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,540
price of course of course if he got if

1051
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,280
he'd have sold all of them at this price

1052
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,170
and brought them all back at this price

1053
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,260
but they were

1054
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,030
he was there was an average price now

1055
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,350
but from here to here is 10 million is a

1056
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,430
million bucks on two thousand contracts

1057
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:01,090
and then after the price dropped he you

1058
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,490
know he looked at him and said hey if I

1059
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:08,080
can do that anybody can do that if I can

1060
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,590
do that

1061
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,920
anybody can do it now think about the

1062
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,620
implications of what I just said if you

1063
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,210
remember back in that surveying that we

1064
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,470
just took a little while ago and I said

1065
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,480
it only takes one trader somewhere in

1066
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,800
the world than a gate the positive

1067
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,620
outcome of your edge oh gee what if

1068
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,730
you're one of the people that bought

1069
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,280
right here how many people did it take

1070
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,350
to mess up your train just one just one

1071
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,150
person that's all it's usually more than

1072
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:45,130
one but that's all it takes is one you

1073
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,120
guys starting to get the idea

1074
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,800
this kind of stuff is going on all of

1075
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,530
the time as a matter of fact when prices

1076
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,100
move this is usually the reason why when

1077
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,110
I was at Merrill Lynch I mean this I

1078
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,820
mean you know and for many years even

1079
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,790
when I was teaching teaching you know

1080
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,870
material in the psychology of training I

1081
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,130
didn't really include a lot of this

1082
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,540
stuff because I just sort of took it for

1083
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,890
granted that people understood it knew

1084
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,990
it you know and the reason why I took it

1085
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,730
for granted because I guess I learned it

1086
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,470
so early in my trading career that it

1087
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,390
just you know it was self-evident to me

1088
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:22,240
but it was self-evident because here I

1089
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,640
was at Merrill Lynch and and I had I had

1090
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,130
access to a squawk box now our squawk

1091
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,840
boxes were open phone lines to the

1092
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,340
various pits in both Chicago and New

1093
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,990
York meaning we had Merrill Lynch

1094
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,610
representatives in each of those pits

1095
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,310
that as buy and sell orders would come

1096
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,580
in they would tell us who was buying and

1097
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,770
who was selling what houses what

1098
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,930
manufacturers what big accounts what big

1099
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,030
traders if they could in other words if

1100
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,260
they had if they had access to the

1101
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,450
information they would tell us who was

1102
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,630
buying you know and and and maybe who

1103
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:53,740
was even taking the other side of their

1104
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,170
orders if they could determine it so

1105
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,840
it's like he had a very intimate it was

1106
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,130
like you know you had this sort of

1107
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,970
intimate connection with what was really

1108
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,240
going on now at the same time when I was

1109
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,950
doing my own technical analysis I would

1110
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,190
do I would do my equations because we

1111
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,300
didn't have computers back then of

1112
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:13,990
course you can do that

1113
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,850
the hewitt packard the handheld thing

1114
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,350
but I didn't do that I did all my

1115
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,360
equations on all my analysis on a

1116
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,480
spreadsheet and I actually did all the

1117
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,150
all the calculations by hand and I did

1118
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,370
it on purpose that way so that I could

1119
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,620
get an intimate sense of how the actual

1120
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,010
mathematics of my signals in other words

1121
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,800
actual calculations the multiplications

1122
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,350
the divisions of subtractions you know

1123
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,090
and what that what the final product was

1124
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,370
in terms of a signal how it related to

1125
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,190
the actual market movement and I found

1126
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,920
that there was no relationship other

1127
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,090
than the fact that it would identify

1128
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,610
patterns where the signals would work

1129
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,650
sometimes and you know sometimes they

1130
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,540
wouldn't but the point is is that there

1131
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,250
wasn't any relationship between this

1132
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,170
fixed mathematical formula and the

1133
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,670
people who were buying and selling at

1134
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,960
that moment the reasons why they were

1135
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,500
doing it

1136
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,750
there was none at all

1137
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,799
but not only that here's what really

1138
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:11,089
shocked me is we had a TV monitors going

1139
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:14,299
all the time and we had it on in Chicago

1140
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,829
there was a local investment channel

1141
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:17,930
channel 26 and it was very much like

1142
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,760
CNBC now but it was a lot less

1143
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,369
sophisticated and you know so we'd watch

1144
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:25,609
as people would come on the show and and

1145
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,230
with various you know you have various

1146
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,460
interviews and that sort of thing and

1147
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,799
I'm watching watching one morning and

1148
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:32,720
there's this vice president from hind

1149
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,760
hold which was now doesn't exist anymore

1150
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,349
but they were one of the biggest hog and

1151
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:38,240
and meat producers in the Midwest back

1152
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,880
in the 80s and this hump this vice

1153
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,260
president from hind hold is being

1154
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,670
interviewed by you know the guy in

1155
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,980
channel 26 and he's talking about how

1156
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,740
you know how people got people got to

1157
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,690
get into live hogs and pork bellies

1158
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,730
because prices are going up and you know

1159
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,170
and he's just going on and on about what

1160
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,240
a great investment it is and and really

1161
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,799
and here and this one happened quite

1162
00:47:57,799 --> 00:47:59,240
frequently by the way but this was just

1163
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,250
an example and all the phones started

1164
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,349
lighten up these are all the people in

1165
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,910
the Chicago area the typical you know

1166
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,559
the traders in the Chicago area then a

1167
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,210
listener to this guy because I think I

1168
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,740
say that because the phones are lighting

1169
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,029
up and all the brokers are starting to

1170
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:14,390
take orders to uh to buy bellies and buy

1171
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,880
hogs and I don't think well you know

1172
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,589
that was pretty a pretty impactful right

1173
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:20,660
oh gee and then on squawk box guess

1174
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,710
who's taken the other side of those

1175
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:26,269
orders hein hold they needed somebody to

1176
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,589
come in and take the other side of their

1177
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:37,190
orders what is a mathematical formula

1178
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,259
have to do with that now as it just so

1179
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:42,259
happens if my math is working in a way

1180
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:44,660
where I happen to get in at that moment

1181
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,250
I end up in a winning trade well that's

1182
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,170
great but that doesn't mean I could rely

1183
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,430
it on the rely on it to do the same

1184
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,299
thing the next time

1185
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,640
okay explain hedging reverse auction in

1186
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,650
a normal auction this I'll talk about

1187
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,869
dynamic traders right now in a normal

1188
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:10,430
auction what do people do in a normal

1189
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,760
auction in other words of you're in in a

1190
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,040
situation where where those things or

1191
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,420
items are up for bid when you bid when

1192
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,890
you're out bidding somebody what are you

1193
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,930
doing you're limiting the competition

1194
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,849
right in other words by bidding higher

1195
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,680
your hopefully eliminating

1196
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,630
anybody else who'll bid higher than you

1197
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,060
hedgers and commercials and dynamic

1198
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,070
traders create what I call a reverse

1199
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,640
auction they'll bid a market up or offer

1200
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,880
a lower to try to attract the public

1201
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,130
into the market to take the other side

1202
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:51,940
of their trait you guys with me on this

1203
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,650
they will bid a market up or offer it

1204
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,710
lower as a reverse auction that doesn't

1205
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,570
mean that they want they you know they

1206
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,770
could the market can go higher but

1207
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,270
they're their immediate objective is

1208
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,950
that if they're bidding it up it means

1209
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,869
that they want to sell they just want

1210
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,160
someone to take the other side of their

1211
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,869
trades so they're actually creating a

1212
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:11,030
reverse auction attracting people into

1213
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,950
the market because as the market goes up

1214
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,869
the people to think okay I'm going to be

1215
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:16,490
missing out and and I've got the

1216
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,630
assurance that I need that it's gonna

1217
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,760
keep on going and so they get sucked

1218
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,800
into this move and then and then they

1219
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:30,230
slam them with a huge order now see I

1220
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,030
had intimate contact with a hole that

1221
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:37,099
Merrill Lynch not only that I mean cuz

1222
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,170
because I knew the floor traders I knew

1223
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,400
many of the floor traders who actually

1224
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
created the movement that particular day

1225
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,960
and there were a number of times where

1226
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,400
the movement was significant and they

1227
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,470
were fast markets and you know enough to

1228
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,780
track the the media to the exchange and

1229
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,099
you know when they put a microphone in

1230
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:53,720
front of their front of their mouth and

1231
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,580
you know and that I definitely they

1232
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,050
definitely would say something that was

1233
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,060
palatable to the public in other words

1234
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,670
what was reasonable I can guarantee you

1235
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,900
that the reason why they did what they

1236
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,430
did during the day had nothing to do

1237
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,430
with what they said nothing there was no

1238
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,210
relationship whatsoever

1239
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,160
go ahead I'll fully understand your

1240
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,190
concept of the movement that's taking

1241
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,150
place because of dynamic players and I

1242
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,890
can understand how that would relate to

1243
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,080
the commodity stock and stock options

1244
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,500
market but can you have the same effect

1245
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,330
and say the foreign currency market

1246
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,000
where it's a much bigger market that's

1247
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,330
traded worldwide it just depends on the

1248
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,430
player absolutely you get a central bank

1249
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,869
that starts that starts doing this

1250
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:45,340
starts unloading something and then

1251
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,660
they're gonna is going to have a major

1252
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,630
impact on the market yes but you yeah

1253
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,520
you've got basically what you have is a

1254
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,800
situation where where this markets so

1255
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,130
large it's so liquid that it would be

1256
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,740
very difficult for individuals to have

1257
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,140
any impact on it is that what you're

1258
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,730
saying to me is that what you're well I

1259
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,890
wasn't necessarily limiting it to

1260
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:09,540
individuals I mean even a central bank

1261
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,640
just on the world market could they have

1262
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,410
that kind of an import it's what I call

1263
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,599
the pebble in a pond effect okay they

1264
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,250
might not have enough they might not

1265
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,190
have enough impact initially okay

1266
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,770
initially to do something okay to have

1267
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,200
to have that meaningful making to create

1268
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,000
that meaningful of a price move but

1269
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,770
you've got a pebble in a pond which is

1270
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,119
the way a lot of prices move anyway

1271
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,740
because it's like what you've got to

1272
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,470
drop a pebble in a pond well if it's you

1273
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,040
know it creates waves does it not okay

1274
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,890
and what I found is that especially with

1275
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,680
floor traders and and and really the

1276
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,450
kind of same the kind of same that the

1277
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,230
same kind of dynamics work even even

1278
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,250
with off the floor traders in the

1279
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,260
general market itself I found that what

1280
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,660
you had is that most floor traders did

1281
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,089
not know what they were doing in the

1282
00:52:58,089 --> 00:52:59,859
sense that they didn't have a real good

1283
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:01,869
reason for buying or selling at any

1284
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,160
given moment other than the fact that

1285
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,690
they were following the lead of other

1286
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,339
people who thought they thought did have

1287
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:08,800
an idea of what they're doing so what

1288
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,990
ends up happening is that is that what

1289
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,880
you've got is you've got the guy the

1290
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,650
trader who's confident knows exactly

1291
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,450
what he's doing why he wants to do it

1292
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,760
and does it and then you've got you got

1293
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,830
all the other guys who are let's say in

1294
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,500
the pit okay who are closest to

1295
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,970
this particular this guy might be on

1296
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,950
this step right here who are closest to

1297
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,190
this guy that will that will mimic what

1298
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,260
he does and then what it does it starts

1299
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,600
spreading out and that and that as as

1300
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,630
word gets out okay the guys at the

1301
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,490
farthest then end up getting you prices

1302
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,290
that are that are greatly diminished in

1303
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,340
relationship to this particular

1304
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,170
individual but the point is is kind of

1305
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,970
like the pebble in the pond a central

1306
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,320
bank could create create the same thing

1307
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,140
in other words initially a central bank

1308
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,870
hitting the market with a huge order

1309
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:58,210
might be absorbed but the fact that the

1310
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,250
central bank is doing it will cause

1311
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,020
other people to want to do it too and

1312
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,150
therefore as a result of all the other

1313
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,400
traders who pile on it creates a huge

1314
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,220
move does that make sense okay

1315
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,240
we're moving right along here okay

1316
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,400
dynamic traders okay players they know

1317
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,260
and understand the mindset and behavior

1318
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,030
patterns of the crowd or herd they they

1319
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,310
they basically refer to the general

1320
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,560
public as the herd and they are the herd

1321
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,650
masters okay they are the herd masters

1322
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,910
whenever possible they will use that

1323
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,560
knowledge to move prices in a way that

1324
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,880
will extract the most amount of money

1325
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,850
from the largest number of traders that

1326
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:46,320
is their mission that is what they do

1327
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,000
characteristic the passive technical

1328
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,890
traders they're usually mystified by

1329
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,110
price movement would that be a fair

1330
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,260
characterization okay they wouldn't

1331
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,610
think about trying to cause price

1332
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,930
movement as a result they typically

1333
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,310
can't conceive of anyone else doing it

1334
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:00,750
either

1335
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,950
they're typically drawn into trades

1336
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,360
based on an opinion about the

1337
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,950
attractiveness of the price or Stampede

1338
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,380
it out because of fear the passive

1339
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,790
technical traders objective is to find

1340
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,230
himself in a winning trade without any

1341
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,500
intent to move prices now think about

1342
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,080
what you're doing you are trading in a

1343
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,060
way where you want to find yourself in a

1344
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,940
winning trade but absolutely wouldn't

1345
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,930
even think about moving prices to do it

1346
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,250
you're completely dependent on someone

1347
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:32,080
else doing it for you to find himself in

1348
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,490
a winning trade he's dependent on the

1349
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,260
traders to be willing to either buy or

1350
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,000
sell at a worse price in himself to

1351
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,490
create

1352
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,800
movement in his direction the typical

1353
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,450
passive technical trader is expecting

1354
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,710
other dynamic traders to make him a

1355
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,450
winner when they usually have little or

1356
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,619
no knowledge insight or understanding

1357
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:48,410
about how dynamic traders operate would

1358
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:53,000
that be fair the typical passive trader

1359
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,350
does not realize it only takes one

1360
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,600
dynamic trader somewhere in the world to

1361
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,140
negate the positive outcome of his edge

1362
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,910
is that a fair statement now does

1363
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,230
anybody want to argue with the statement

1364
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,450
anymore or and I'd say anybody did in

1365
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,860
the first place but there are some

1366
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,810
people who realize their hand and said

1367
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,210
that that wasn't the case is there

1368
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,590
anybody that that's not convinced about

1369
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,930
this seriously I want to know and I'm

1370
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,400
not we're not going to get into a fight

1371
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,000
or anything but you know ok the

1372
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,500
characteristics of technical analysis

1373
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,410
now what we're going to do is we're

1374
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,540
going to take what we now understand

1375
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,590
about the nature of price movement and

1376
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,600
look at the nature of technical analysis

1377
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,820
to see to see what we got here okay see

1378
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,220
how well it you know in meshes ok

1379
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,100
technical indicators define identify and

1380
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,780
organize market data the up and down

1381
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,830
ticks and to understand a little

1382
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:49,359
patterns are you guys with me on this

1383
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,119
the patterns are observed observable

1384
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:53,840
quantifiable meaning that can be

1385
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,670
measured and repeat themselves with

1386
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,490
statistical reliability and and really

1387
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,260
and while I'm doing this and while we're

1388
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,430
going through this I want you guys to

1389
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,810
really keep in mind that that just

1390
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,680
because I explained the the underlying

1391
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,150
characteristics of dynamic traders and

1392
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,740
people who can actually move the market

1393
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,010
and do it and do it all the time in fact

1394
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,450
when the markets moving they're the ones

1395
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,900
who are doing it it's not you or I the

1396
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,790
only time you or I move the market is

1397
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,980
when there's an overabundance of market

1398
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,390
orders coming into the market from

1399
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,359
passive technical traders because the

1400
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,640
market order does what okay if the last

1401
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,770
forget in the last price is 10 we've got

1402
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:36,470
nine and we've got 11 ok what's the

1403
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,900
market the last price is 10 if I want to

1404
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,290
buy the markets actually 11 isn't it

1405
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,609
that's the market because that's where

1406
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:46,340
the offers are the offers are at 11 so

1407
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,420
that's where I'm going to get filled I'm

1408
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,220
going to get filled at 11 well if

1409
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,320
there's so many buy orders come mark

1410
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,350
by orders coming into the market and all

1411
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,690
the all the offers are taken out at

1412
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,180
11:00 then that means the next price up

1413
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,350
where there's offers are 12 and that's

1414
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,010
what I'm going to get filled and if

1415
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,390
there's so many more that got in before

1416
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,240
me and this is real I mean it's really

1417
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,640
an overabundance of buy orders and

1418
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,350
relationship to the number of offers

1419
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,360
that are that that exist then I might

1420
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,360
get filled of 13 because that's the

1421
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,520
market so that's the difference you've

1422
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,150
got you've got an overabundance of

1423
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,890
passive technical orders coming into the

1424
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,840
market that will drive it up or you've

1425
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,640
got dynamic traders who are doing it

1426
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,890
purposefully and when they're doing it

1427
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,960
purposefully I guarantee you they got

1428
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,180
they got a good reason for it they know

1429
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,410
what they're doing I'm not saying it

1430
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,180
always works but they know what they're

1431
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:44,630
doing and it doesn't mean that you can't

1432
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,710
take advantage of it

1433
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,020
it doesn't mean that you can't make a

1434
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,150
consistent income even I'm you know a

1435
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,730
really a really good consistent income

1436
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,300
with your technical methodologies you

1437
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,890
don't you don't even have to you don't

1438
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,240
have to understand all these these

1439
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,940
subtle dynamics or market or price

1440
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,410
movement to be able to take advantage of

1441
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,780
of it all you've got to do is be able to

1442
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,790
trade your edge and follow your plan I

1443
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,800
just want you understand that when you

1444
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,650
understand what's going on you will will

1445
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,930
be able to trade your plan because you

1446
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,150
won't be putting so much emphasis on

1447
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,690
things that don't have any relevance

1448
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:25,430
like expecting this next trade to work

1449
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,920
just because you got a signal is this

1450
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,800
what drives the price up typically early

1451
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,540
in the morning like on when the market

1452
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,930
opens some popular stock all the market

1453
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,300
all the orders come in or it goes down

1454
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,430
and is that what creates this gap or

1455
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,350
well I can't tell you the academia would

1456
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,910
say what that's what happens I mean well

1457
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,830
you can lose it that's why is it a log

1458
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,590
jam right you can you can always break

1459
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,500
it down to one fundamental reason the

1460
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,760
only fun no the only reason that they're

1461
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,120
really there is there's an imbalance in

1462
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,580
between between buyers and sellers price

1463
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,470
movement is always the result of an

1464
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,540
imbalance because when there's balance

1465
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,800
there's no movement

1466
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,080
it's that simple right if there's

1467
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,420
balance there's no movement prices do

1468
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,360
not move when there's balance there has

1469
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,890
to be an imbalance for people to bid it

1470
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,660
up or offer a lower and if people aren't

1471
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,220
actually bidding it up in this example

1472
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,870
we don't see what the reason I can't

1473
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,880
answer you exactly is because I don't

1474
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,140
know if it's actually being bid up

1475
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,450
purposefully by somebody or it's because

1476
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,880
there's an overabundance of buy orders

1477
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,080
and relationship to the amount of offers

1478
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:37,940
that's what I don't know okay the

1479
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,560
Payette the patterns basically measure

1480
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,120
the collective mind of the market in

1481
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,950
other words here then I should have and

1482
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,120
I should have really emphasized this

1483
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,300
word collective collective mind of the

1484
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,330
market not the individual Minds the

1485
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,210
collective mind meaning all of the

1486
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:56,690
actions all of the beliefs all of the

1487
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,900
agendas all of the objectives are built

1488
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,630
into that next incremental price change

1489
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,000
from eleven to twelve or from twelve to

1490
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,640
thirteen it's all there and the only

1491
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,410
thing that mathematical formulas can do

1492
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,770
is actually measure that you know

1493
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,960
measure the patterns that result from

1494
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,810
that information it isn't getting the

1495
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,760
information of the guy who actually bid

1496
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,020
the market up by taking out all the

1497
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,940
offers because he's got some specific

1498
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,260
agenda about what he wants to do with

1499
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,700
where he wants to see the prices go

1500
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,220
because he's doing something has nothing

1501
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,170
to do with any of this meaning your

1502
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,210
technical methodology or anybody else's

1503
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,070
he might be putting on a huge hedge

1504
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,320
position based on some contract that he

1505
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,270
has to deliver something three months

1506
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,540
from now

1507
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,859
so collective mind of the market

1508
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,060
indicating when there is a higher

1509
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,619
probability of one thing happening over

1510
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:01,780
another represented as an edge so

1511
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,369
because the patterns show up in every

1512
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,980
timeframe technical analysis turns the

1513
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,349
market into an unending stream of

1514
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,750
opportunities to enrich ourselves these

1515
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,119
patterns that the mathematical formulas

1516
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,440
identify show up in every timeframe from

1517
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,450
the smallest to the largest and as a

1518
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,910
result if we learn how to think about

1519
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,510
these patterns or edges appropriately it

1520
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,670
will actually turn the market into an

1521
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:36,550
unending stream to enrich ourselves but

1522
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:42,160
not on a trade by trade basis but not on

1523
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,950
a trade by trade basis but rather as a

1524
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:47,800
percentage over a series of trades this

1525
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,050
is big guys this is it right here this

1526
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,270
is the holy grail of technical analysis

1527
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,859
right here right now your technical

1528
01:02:56,859 --> 01:02:59,410
indicators will turn the market into an

1529
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,580
unending stream of opportunity to enrich

1530
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:07,240
yourself but not on a trade by trade

1531
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:15,250
basis but rather as a percentage over a

1532
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,710
series of trades that means you have to

1533
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:23,740
learn how to think of probabilities you

1534
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,230
may understand the concept of

1535
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,940
probabilities it doesn't mean that you

1536
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,609
can think that way I've worked with

1537
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:32,200
traders in fact one guy came to one of

1538
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,030
my workshops many years ago a hedge fund

1539
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:37,000
manager reasonably successful you know

1540
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,589
let's say reasonably because he made you

1541
01:03:38,589 --> 01:03:41,710
know that I was a 10 to 18% a year but

1542
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,140
his indicators if he had followed them

1543
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,060
the way you know the way they were

1544
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,220
planned to be followed he could have

1545
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,900
made anywhere from 60 to 70 percent a

1546
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,210
year little frustrated came to a

1547
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,040
workshop and then you know some some

1548
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,230
consultations afterwards in one

1549
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,000
particular situation where he said you

1550
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,710
know he put in a trade a trade even

1551
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,850
watching four months

1552
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,950
finally got to his price level you know

1553
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,870
he put the trade on and put a stop in

1554
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,730
the market you know and the market

1555
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,200
started approaching his stop and you

1556
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,870
know he he got out he got out of the

1557
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:14,680
trade early it market didn't hit a stop

1558
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,940
he got out of the trade early and then

1559
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,490
it just went just just fell to pieces

1560
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:20,350
and because he was short and he you know

1561
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,970
in his direction he wasn't in the trade

1562
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,880
and he would have been someone who would

1563
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,380
have said that he understood the nature

1564
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,390
of probabilities because he majored in

1565
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:38,470
it in college but it hasn't he did not

1566
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,230
do the sufficient amount of work to

1567
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,690
train his mind to think in probabilities

1568
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,670
at a functional level there's a huge

1569
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:48,190
difference you can't take it for granted

1570
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,200
that because you understand the nature

1571
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,240
of percentages that you can think that

1572
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:01,270
way at a functional level it would be

1573
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,070
you know like you could you can do I'll

1574
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,570
do the analogy to technical analysis to

1575
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:12,220
flipping a coin okay that if you if you

1576
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,550
take an evenly weighted coin and flip it

1577
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,770
a thousand times you've got a large

1578
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:20,890
sample size there right the pattern that

1579
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,340
will emerge with each thousand flip

1580
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,280
sample size is a relatively even

1581
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,370
distribution between heads and tails

1582
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:32,410
maybe not quite 5050 but let's say forty

1583
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:36,850
nine point two and you know of forty

1584
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,740
nine point eight or something or

1585
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,120
whatever there might be a little bit of

1586
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,410
variance more variance there but in any

1587
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,020
case that will be a pattern see that's a

1588
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,180
pattern because it'll happen

1589
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,220
every single time you flip the coin a

1590
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:54,100
thousand times but within that thousand

1591
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,100
flip sample size is there anyway since

1592
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,120
you're going to get an even distribution

1593
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,830
between heads and tails is there any way

1594
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,660
that you can know for sure which

1595
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,430
individual flip is going to be hands in

1596
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,660
which individual flip is going to be

1597
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:10,390
tails no you could get ten flips of

1598
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,960
heads in a row

1599
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,359
and be absolutely positive the next

1600
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,740
one's going to be tails and it could

1601
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,770
come up heads again and even though you

1602
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,450
can have all these streaks of heads and

1603
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:24,150
tails in the end they're still going to

1604
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:31,500
come up 50/50 this is exactly the way

1605
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:37,740
technical analysis works exactly when

1606
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,830
you consider the diversity the diversity

1607
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,320
of the market with all the different

1608
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,849
players and all the different agendas

1609
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:48,210
from people all over the world trying to

1610
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,930
predict what will happen next would be

1611
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,550
almost equivalent to sitting in front of

1612
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,830
a slot machine and coming up with some

1613
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,190
rational reason why you think that the

1614
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,260
pattern that you're looking for is going

1615
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,089
to come up on the next push of the

1616
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:05,119
button

1617
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:17,140
it wouldn't make a lot of sense would it

1618
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,900
but the reason why it's we get fooled as

1619
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,190
traders and we think of it in and not

1620
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,760
this and not this probabilistic way is

1621
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,620
because when we put on a trade we put on

1622
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,770
a trade for a reason see reasons are

1623
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,960
important in our lives

1624
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,620
reasons are important we've put on a

1625
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,430
trade for a reason and see the problem

1626
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,940
is is that when the trade works we think

1627
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,340
are we just naturally think our reason

1628
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,570
was right what I'm trying to do here is

1629
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,350
help you disconnect is disconnect any

1630
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:59,570
reason that you put on a trade with the

1631
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,760
reason why it actually moved because

1632
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,070
like I said before there's almost never

1633
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:08,270
a relationship there's almost never a

1634
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:15,970
correlation and so the next time that

1635
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,549
reason seems to appear in the market

1636
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:21,020
we're gonna we're gonna do the same

1637
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,350
thing thinking we'll get the same result

1638
01:08:30,469 --> 01:08:34,960
and then we don't we feel betrayed and

1639
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,109
then the next time the reason comes up

1640
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:41,649
we're gonna be a little hesitant you

1641
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,870
might not put it on at all we'll try to

1642
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,600
find additional reasons why this trade

1643
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,600
will work well the reality is there

1644
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,069
isn't any reason you're going to be able

1645
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:53,479
to come up with it's going to assure you

1646
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,399
of anything unless the reason you're

1647
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,529
coming up with is you know the people

1648
01:08:57,529 --> 01:08:58,790
who are actually going to bid them hark

1649
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,589
it up or offer a lower and they tell you

1650
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:04,310
what they're gonna do and why ultimately

1651
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,930
there's only one reason why markets why

1652
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,000
prices move and what would that reason

1653
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,680
be come on yeah an imbalance in

1654
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,089
conviction that's the only and what

1655
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:16,100
technical analysis does is it finds

1656
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,080
patterns in that imbalance okay

1657
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,109
technical analysis finds and patterns in

1658
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:26,870
the imbalance where there's momentum in

1659
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:30,319
a direction it's still not going to tell

1660
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,890
you what's going to happen next

1661
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,299
technical analysis doesn't nor can it

1662
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:36,529
get into the minds of any particular

1663
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:38,000
individual trader who has both the

1664
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,160
financial and psychological resources to

1665
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,540
either move prices or defend certain

1666
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,488
price levels and traders will defend

1667
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:46,160
price levels by the way there are

1668
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,229
dynamic traders who will actually defend

1669
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:54,949
a price is it reasonable to expect the

1670
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:57,530
fix criteria that make up a mathematical

1671
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,800
formula the sake to stay consistent with

1672
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,870
a dynamic event that's in perpetual

1673
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,140
motion on a trade by trade basis what's

1674
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,480
the answer to that well what does the

1675
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,190
answer come on no no it is not

1676
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:17,410
reasonable no it is not

1677
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,159
especially where that motion is being

1678
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,570
caused by traitors all around the world

1679
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,909
with different beliefs objectives and

1680
01:10:30,909 --> 01:10:33,760
agendas there was no way of determining

1681
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,560
the intentions of all these traitors yet

1682
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,890
the typical passive trader trades their

1683
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:41,050
methodology as if they are being told

1684
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,870
what those intentions are the

1685
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,770
professionals do not you guys get that

1686
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:50,020
the typical passive technical trader

1687
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,570
trades their methodology as if they are

1688
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,590
being told what their intentions are

1689
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:59,100
whereas the professional does not and

1690
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,600
why doesn't the professional because the

1691
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,190
professional understands the underlying

1692
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,020
dynamics of price movement and that

1693
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,520
anybody could come into the market at

1694
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,630
any time to do anything

1695
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,010
there was another floor trader that I

1696
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,920
work with who executed a trainers own

1697
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,390
accountant in soybean market but also

1698
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,150
also executed the orders for one at the

1699
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,830
time one of the biggest soybean

1700
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,480
producers in the world there was an

1701
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,100
Italian firm that actually tried the

1702
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,480
corn of the soybean market got thrown

1703
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,340
off the Board of Trade but before that

1704
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,890
happened you know there was many days

1705
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,260
where you know they he would call you

1706
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,270
know be in touch with the the head

1707
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,980
traders at the Home Office and their

1708
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,659
plotting out their strategy you know

1709
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:38,830
like you know he told me one day you

1710
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,719
know it's like like the whole strategy

1711
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,520
for that day from the Home Office

1712
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,760
traders the whole strategy was to spank

1713
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,820
the locals at the Chicago Board of Trade

1714
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,920
that wasn't only purpose that day they

1715
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,050
were gonna suck the locals into a trade

1716
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:56,760
and they were gonna try to wipe them out

1717
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,270
this is that we're gonna spank the

1718
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:03,810
locals today

1719
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,390
now your mathematical pattern okay you

1720
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,360
happen to get a buy signal ends up to be

1721
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,040
a big winning trade you think it's

1722
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,810
because because a couple of lines

1723
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,960
crossed you know no matter what it is

1724
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,240
you know with a stochastic sore Weis

1725
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,690
trade or whatever doesn't really matter

1726
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,430
it had absolutely nothing to do with the

1727
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,460
reality of why the price is moved

1728
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:42,450
nothing this is the primary

1729
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,830
characteristic that separates the

1730
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:47,280
professional from everyone else what I

1731
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,970
just said right here
