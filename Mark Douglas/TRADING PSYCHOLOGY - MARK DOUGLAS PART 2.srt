1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,179
in this section we're going to cover the

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,890
underlying nature of the mental skills

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,210
that you're going to be learning and

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,160
then at the end of the section I'm going

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
to put these skills within the context

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,780
of three developmental modes that you're

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,429
going to eventually learn to trade in

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,529
which would be first the mechanical mode

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,720
then the subjective mode and then the

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,140
intuitive everybody kind of have a good

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,800
idea where we're going today

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
maybe a little bit better of an idea

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,460
than when you kind of walked in here

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,820
yeah okay so anyway what I want to do is

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,200
let's just let's just go through and

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,969
take a little bit of an attitude survey

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,010
here kind of get an idea where you're at

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,320
there are no right or wrong answers here

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,329
it's just a matter of what you believe

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,640
about the nature of training so if we

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,170
get it's kind of money making money the

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,090
traders primarily a function of analysis

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,730
who would agree with that raise your

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,870
hands it's alright you raise your hands

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,610
so you're telling me that only a few

26
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,530
people would agree part of it okay okay

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,379
I often find myself thinking there must

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,260
be a way to trade without having to take

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,670
a loss come on be honest come on oh yeah

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,180
yeah

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,799
you know oh let's say I find myself

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
thinking that there must be a way at a

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,570
trade well taking a loss right okay okay

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,729
by the way the first one when one of the

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,860
things one I mean this is one this is a

36
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,860
primary one of the things we're going to

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
talk about a lot of making money as a

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,799
traders primarily functional analysis

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,990
that that really isn't the case at all

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,790
what you're going to learn in other

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,780
words trading is execution trading is

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,939
execution how what you decide to do of

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,369
course is analysis and the problem is

44
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,659
that it depends on what you're using

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,729
your analysis for if you're using your

46
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,399
analysis to avoid the risk then then

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,040
certainly making money is not a function

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
of that because you will you will

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,490
virtually consistently lose but we're

50
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,079
gonna talk about that more in a little

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,860
bit okay okay I have trouble getting out

52
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,780
of a losing trade who has anybody here

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,009
still have trouble getting out of a

54
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,229
losing trade okay that's fine you won't

55
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,409
have that trouble after today I got I'm

56
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,240
really my goal is that when you walk out

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,950
of here you will understand and no

58
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,060
uncertain terms that there was

59
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,300
absolutely absolutely no reason to hang

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,630
on

61
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,260
what you will define in advance as a

62
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,560
losing trade do you find yourself

63
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,270
planning trades you never execute an

64
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,120
executing trades you never planned

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,350
that's a pretty common things that

66
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,360
affect most traders there is always a

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
cost associated with finding out what

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,350
the market may do next it's good to

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,850
think that that means you're accepting

70
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,800
the risk that there's a certain amount

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,810
of cost meaning a certain amount of risk

72
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,040
involved to finding out what the market

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,840
one may do next if I were to thoroughly

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,700
analyze my trading results I would find

75
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,410
that my average losing trade is much

76
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,120
bigger than my average winning trade

77
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,580
well a few people in here that might

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,470
still be fall in that category it only

79
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,060
takes one trader somewhere in the world

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,680
to negate the positive outcome of any

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,610
particular trade who agrees with that

82
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,750
anybody raise your hand if you agree

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,880
with that place nobody raises their hand

84
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,460
oh this is big I love it thank you very

85
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,170
much thank you very much for not

86
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,790
agreeing with that because you couldn't

87
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,340
be further from the truth it couldn't be

88
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,860
more wrong this is one of the things

89
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
you're gonna learn it only takes one

90
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,880
trader somewhere in the world to negate

91
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,710
the positive outcome of your trade or

92
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,820
your edge that's all just one you're

93
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,920
gonna learn that today I wouldn't put on

94
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,390
a trade if I wasn't sure it was going to

95
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,610
be a winner who agrees with that

96
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,020
statement please raise your hand please

97
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,900
who agrees that say I'm good good good

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,020
I'm saying good because because what I'm

99
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,820
seeing is that yes there is a gap here

100
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,930
that we're gonna have to fill between

101
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,120
your particular attitudes about training

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,220
now and and where you're gonna end up

103
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,340
with hopefully by the end of the day I

104
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,959
would answer this question absolutely

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,350
not

106
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,360
I wouldn't put on this trade ever wasn't

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,350
sure I was going to be a winner

108
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,090
I've trade trade from the perspective of

109
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,680
I don't know if any trade is going to be

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,959
a winner and I said I don't have to know

111
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,240
as a matter of fact that is one of the

112
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,660
principle let's say principle concepts

113
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,760
that you will have to adapt to become a

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,250
consistently successful trader and what

115
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,320
the pros have adapted and the reason why

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,690
they can do what they do is because they

117
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,060
have learned not just learn but they

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,210
believe without a shred of doubt that

119
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,710
they do not have to know what's going to

120
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,340
happen next

121
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,070
make money and don't even think about it

122
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,960
in those terms they don't even think

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,449
about it in those terms it's not a

124
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,070
matter of what's going going to happen

125
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,870
next when you understand the nature of

126
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,330
how technical analysis how your

127
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,310
technical formulas and your mathematical

128
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,790
formulas interact with market behavior

129
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,949
and what they can and can't do and what

130
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,810
their inherent limitations are you will

131
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,600
also understand that I wouldn't put on a

132
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,370
trade if I wasn't sure it was going to

133
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,490
be a winner is absolutely one of the one

134
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,620
of the worst mistakes you can make to be

135
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,280
consistently successful trader it is a

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,820
fact it's probably the number one kind

137
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,190
of perplexing at this moment yes good ok

138
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,570
I always define my risk before I enter a

139
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,100
trade does everybody here in this room

140
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,930
at the point where they always

141
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,900
predefined their risk who doesn't raise

142
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,160
your hand please raise your hand I want

143
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,570
to know where everyone's at come on it's

144
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,940
all right ok sometimes I find myself

145
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,039
blaming the market for what went wrong

146
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,360
well let me ask you this is anybody

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,669
anybody feel betrayed by the market ever

148
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,300
and anybody ever feel betrayed by their

149
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,520
by their their their their signals their

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,770
technical signal or whatever methodology

151
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,770
that they use we're going to talk about

152
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,490
that in detail too

153
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,720
the more trader learns about the nature

154
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,039
of the markets the easier it will be for

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,229
him to execute his trades who thinks as

156
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,820
a correlation there that the more I

157
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,380
learn about the nature of markets and

158
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,090
price movement the easier will be to

159
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,440
execute your trades who think there's a

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,630
positive correlation there ok

161
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,160
again couldn't be further from the truth

162
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
there's a negative correlation there the

163
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,550
more you learn the harder is going to be

164
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,950
to execute your trades to be it depends

165
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,419
on why you're learning and of course but

166
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,280
we'll get into that to be a successful

167
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,780
technical trader you have to determine

168
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,139
what the market is going to do next I

169
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,180
already said that's not the case so so

170
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,979
you'll know how to answer that one but

171
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,330
but if I hadn't said it how would you

172
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,780
have answered it who would have said yes

173
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,020
if I hadn't have already told you guys a

174
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,250
couple of people and you came to Houston

175
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,570
oh come on

176
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,150
okay trading skills who are the

177
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,800
professionals we already talked about

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
that and why would it be beneficial to

179
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,029
think like a professional trader we

180
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,080
already talked about that what's the

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,469
answer

182
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:52,309
ah anybody can make money okay

183
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:53,659
we're kind of already established the

184
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,069
fact that anybody can make money as a

185
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,770
trader yeah we're talking about

186
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,719
consistency what we want to do is we

187
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,939
want to close that profit gap we want to

188
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:02,930
we want to make sure that our

189
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,360
bottom-line results reflect the

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,499
potential of our methodologies okay and

191
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,689
that's what the professional has learned

192
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,389
how to do the professional has learned

193
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,939
how to close that profit gap they have

194
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,219
learned the appropriate skills to do

195
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,949
that they're people just like you and me

196
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,529
okay they're no different they really

197
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,439
aren't they've evolved into a different

198
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,629
way of thinking about trading that's the

199
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,709
reason why they can do it and you can do

200
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,279
it too with understanding and awareness

201
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,379
that is really primarily what this

202
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,749
workshop is about anyway because because

203
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,189
when you think about if you've read

204
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,069
stories of people who have have aspired

205
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,589
to greatness in as a trader you'll

206
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,539
always find but almost all of them that

207
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,009
there's this underlying thread this

208
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,769
underlying theme that that virtually all

209
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,779
of them have lost one or more of what

210
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,360
they considered a fortune before they

211
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,680
started becoming consistently successful

212
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,419
why do you think that underlying thread

213
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,240
our theme exists in their lives what's

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,649
that why do you think that commonality

215
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:14,839
exists because at some point they lose

216
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,559
so often and then come back from losing

217
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,539
that one they gain the confidence that

218
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,059
they can do it and as a result the fear

219
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,099
dissipates and as soon as the fear is

220
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,449
gone they're trading from a carefree

221
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,219
state of mind and when you trade from

222
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,689
that carefree state of mind everything

223
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:35,630
about your trainings changes remember

224
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,099
that the primary skill that we're

225
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,620
talking about here is simply trading

226
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,889
without fear this is a trading skill it

227
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,959
is the primary skill that you will have

228
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,790
to acquire to create consistency

229
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,260
to trade without fear what does

230
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
consistency look like I've already went

231
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,680
through on the on the grease board here

232
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,630
and showed you a consistently rising

233
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,270
equity curve with the draw downs the

234
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,950
normal draw downs being a reflection of

235
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,240
what can you anybody remember what I

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,460
said about that what was that

237
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,370
normal losses that reflect any trading

238
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,080
methodology right okay what skills are

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,580
necessary to experience a winning trade

240
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,590
now think about now I'm gonna contrast

241
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,220
okay

242
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm gonna do a little bit contrasting

243
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,280
here just just to show you one of the

244
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,250
reasons why it can be so difficult to

245
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,900
get even into a frame of mind where we

246
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,430
start asking the the appropriate

247
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,350
questions about what do I need to really

248
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,320
be consistently successful because what

249
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
does it really take to experience a

250
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,730
winning train what skills do you need

251
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,950
anybody got any idea what skills do you

252
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,800
need to experience a winning trade but

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,690
what's your name sir Maurice says a

254
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,110
click of the mouse who's with Maurice on

255
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,770
that come on who's with Maurice on a

256
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,830
click of the mouse got one two anybody

257
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,530
else three four he's absolutely right

258
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,490
that's all it takes

259
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,390
there are no other skills needed no

260
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,150
other skills needed other than the

261
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,490
actual physical ability to put your

262
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,160
finger on the mouse button and click in

263
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,080
the buyer of the cell and you can find

264
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,450
yourself in a winning trade you can find

265
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,580
yourself in a spectacularly winning

266
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,050
trade far beyond what you could have

267
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,460
ever imagined and what skill did it take

268
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,840
what what did it take there's just doing

269
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,770
it that's all

270
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,120
just doing it at that way at that moment

271
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,560
do you need an edge do you need to

272
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
happen to even even have to know even

273
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,880
know what an edge is is it possible to

274
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
just be to walk up to your computer and

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
the arrow happened to be on the Buy

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,310
button you click and then find yourself

277
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,810
on a winning trade if you didn't have an

278
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,090
ad you did you you just clicked it what

279
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,880
are it take it took nothing

280
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:09,760
do need a plan need no plan do you need

281
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
the discipline to execute the plan no

282
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,600
you don't need that either do you now

283
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,430
see you're gonna be the opposite of all

284
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,930
this of course is what we're gonna be

285
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,310
talking about in terms of creating

286
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:28,329
consistency but go ahead did you say a

287
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,060
squirrel I'm sorry squirrel you okay

288
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:38,620
squirrel okay go ahead that's good it's

289
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,420
all the things that lead up to me that's

290
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,890
the implementation but what about all

291
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,850
the things that lead up to that

292
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,430
implementation Oh understand I'm not I'm

293
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,320
not negating that at all I'm just saying

294
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,570
that that that that the reality is you

295
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,070
don't need anything that's all I'm

296
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,570
saying because I'm contrasting here I'm

297
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,089
just making a contrast between what you

298
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,740
need to be consistent and what you need

299
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,959
to win oh okay that's all I'm doing okay

300
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,850
you just sum that up of what I was about

301
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,320
to say there's all the difference in the

302
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,970
world between having the skills

303
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,100
necessary to experience a winning trade

304
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,500
as compared to having the skills

305
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,040
necessary to consistently experience a

306
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,480
winning absolutely that's what I'm

307
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,829
that's all I'm talking about here

308
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,510
because see there's because what this

309
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,820
does is this the non understanding this

310
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,160
contrast creates what I call is like a

311
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,750
huge psychological gap because if you

312
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,000
don't because it's very easy for us to

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,370
think that trading is easy and if you

314
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,350
believe that trading is easy even if

315
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,120
you're getting even if even if all your

316
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,890
experience is starting to tell you that

317
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,480
it's not it doesn't mean that that

318
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,760
experience is dropping down to a level

319
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,010
of realization where you change your

320
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,690
behavior or change the way that you

321
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,570
think about trading if your first

322
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,060
impression if your first experience was

323
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,610
that this couldn't be simpler and then

324
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,529
you spend you know how many X number of

325
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,899
years or half a lifetime finally coming

326
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,310
to the realization that you know what

327
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,029
yeah to win like what do you need like I

328
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,339
could I could be in a casino and and

329
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,140
plunk a hundred-dollar bill down you

330
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,570
know at a blackjack table and and end up

331
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,710
with a blackjack what did I need

332
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,100
nothing I just happen to win now if I

333
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,480
want to be a professional blackjack

334
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,010
player and make up make a consistent

335
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,900
income from playing blackjack well

336
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,090
that's that's a whole nother matter

337
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,700
isn't it and we're talking about the

338
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,480
same things here with trading there

339
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,220
would be a number of skills that I have

340
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,360
to acquire to be able to make a

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,050
consistent reliable income as a

342
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,760
blackjack player and there are people

343
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:47,130
who do it do you need a good reason to

344
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,340
put the trade on to win do you need a

345
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,120
good reason no not at all what

346
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
characteristics distinguished the pro

347
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,700
from the typical trader

348
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,530
well they plan their trades no they

349
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,760
execute their plan without error ah

350
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,750
we'll talk about trading errors in a

351
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,860
minute big difference okay they can move

352
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,180
in and out of their trades with an ease

353
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,800
and effortlessness that would boggle the

354
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,340
mind of the typical trader okay what do

355
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,660
you need to achieve consistent results

356
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,700
well you're gonna you're gonna need an

357
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,930
edge you're gonna be able to identify an

358
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,980
edge you're gonna have to have a trading

359
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,190
methodology are you not right okay and

360
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,450
you have to have a plan on how to

361
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,340
utilize that edge in other words you're

362
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,580
gonna have to determine risk parameters

363
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,290
how much does it cost me to find out if

364
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,450
this particular edge that my methodology

365
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,670
provides me how much there's gonna cost

366
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,020
them how much they're gonna cost me to

367
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,600
find out that this edge is working on

368
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,420
this particular trade or not that's your

369
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,890
risk parameter are you guys with me on

370
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,280
this okay

371
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,540
money management parameters in other

372
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,550
words how much you're in other words

373
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,170
contract size or number of shares that

374
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,090
you trade all these have to be tailed

375
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,020
this has to be taken in consideration

376
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,540
you could have a standard amount or you

377
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,040
could have an amount that fluctuates

378
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,870
based on you know based on other

379
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,940
criteria that you use you know to

380
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,980
determine you know the level of trade

381
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,450
that it is like it could be like a five

382
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,610
star trade or a 1 star trade with a 5

383
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,900
star trade you're going with a maximum

384
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,220
position with a 1 star trade you go in

385
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,900
with a minimum position and profit

386
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,790
objectives you have to be able to set

387
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,580
profit objectives see just having a

388
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,540
methodology

389
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,449
to get you into a trade is not enough

390
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,290
you have to be able to determine what

391
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,720
the risk is on a consistent basis you

392
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,279
have to know you have to know what your

393
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,560
money management parameters are and you

394
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,880
have to be able to determine where to

395
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,529
take profits these none of these are

396
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:55,199
easy things to do are they trade

397
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,100
execution the ability to execute trades

398
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,480
flawlessly so you can utilize your

399
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,339
trading plan to its maximum potential

400
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,350
this is this is the big one right here

401
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,329
this is the area because when you get

402
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:08,670
right down to it trading is about exit

403
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,720
trading is execution the act of trading

404
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,420
is executing trades and if you're going

405
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,769
to execute trades you're going to have

406
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,779
to be able to do them without errors

407
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,519
because it just it doesn't make any

408
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,319
sense to think that you will that you

409
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,690
will achieve a consistently rising

410
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,730
equity curve if you're constantly making

411
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,790
trading errors trading errors would be

412
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,760
defined as mistakes mistakes and detract

413
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,870
from your bottom-line results now the

414
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,329
interesting thing about mistakes is that

415
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,790
when you're when you're trading from the

416
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,550
let's say the perspective of you know it

417
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,339
doesn't really take anything to win then

418
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,480
there really aren't any mistakes that

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,490
you can make because anything that you

420
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,050
do could and could result in a winning

421
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,980
trade for any reason but when we're

422
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,870
talking about making consistent money or

423
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,329
an income that we can rely on then

424
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,430
everything changes about this everything

425
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,040
changes what I'm talking about here is

426
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,709
I'm talking about these like five or

427
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,619
four broad skill sets to be able to

428
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,839
create consistent results the kind of

429
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,449
results that you can rely on as an

430
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,520
income you're going to have to learn an

431
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,280
edge you're gonna have to acquire a

432
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,140
trading methodology that gives you an

433
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,510
edge I'm defining an edge is that

434
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,189
there's a higher probability of one

435
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,559
thing happening over another that's what

436
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,820
an edge is and you're good we're gonna

437
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,350
learn the nature of probabilities here

438
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,780
in a moment you're gonna have to have

439
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,970
you know you're gonna have to have a

440
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,650
plan on how do you you how you utilize

441
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,900
that edge meaning what the risk is

442
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,630
in size and profit objectives then

443
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,440
they're going to have to be able to

444
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,730
execute they're gonna have to get to the

445
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,770
point you can execute that edge without

446
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,410
making errors for you to be able to

447
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,970
execute that edge without making errors

448
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,290
you're gonna have to learn how to trade

449
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,090
from a carefree state of mind meaning

450
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,710
you're going to have to aspire to the

451
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,180
point where you can train without fear

452
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,280
and to trade without fear you're gonna

453
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,330
have to learn how to think in

454
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,270
probabilities that's basically where

455
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,520
we're going here and I said this primary

456
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,660
skill was learning how to trade without

457
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,700
fear learning how to trade without fear

458
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,440
as a function of learning how to think

459
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,400
in probabilities meaning we're going to

460
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,810
we're going to set aside or move from

461
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,870
thinking in a trade by trade mentality

462
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,210
in other words what this trade is going

463
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,400
to do for me right now am I right or

464
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,260
wrong on this trade and we're gonna move

465
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,480
to a series of trades perspective

466
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,820
because that's what your methodology

467
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,790
does anyway any trading methodology just

468
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,420
gives you a a win or loss ratio over a

469
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,990
percentage of trades in other words if I

470
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,210
take the same take the same criteria

471
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,000
that's in any kind of mathematical any

472
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,290
kind of technical formula it's

473
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,970
mathematical bait mathematically based

474
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,720
or a technical price pattern that you

475
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,690
would be able to see visually what we're

476
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,060
going to learn is that my edge meaning a

477
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,680
higher probability of one thing

478
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,140
happening over another is simply going

479
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,560
to give me a higher win rate over a

480
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,050
series of trades let's say the next 20

481
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,340
trades 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

482
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:26,020
16 17 18 19 20 and that the actual on a

483
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,480
trade by trade basis I don't know which

484
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,740
one's going to win or which one's gonna

485
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,810
lose in advance there is no way for me

486
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,850
to find out there's no way for me to

487
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,040
determine that then on a trade by trade

488
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,900
basis no matter what reason or rationale

489
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,300
that you come up with is that there's no

490
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
way to assure yourself that it's going

491
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,660
to be a winning trade there's nothing

492
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,350
that can tell you that

493
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,280
that training methodologies give you a

494
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,950
win percentage let's say 70% of the next

495
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,200
20 trades are gonna be winners there's

496
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,360
still way I'm gonna know which of the 70

497
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,210
you know which which twelve or thirteen

498
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,980
are going to be the winners or which six

499
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,080
or seven are going to be the losers what

500
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,490
you're going to learn this is what

501
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,380
traders what prep the professionals have

502
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,090
learned is that there's a random

503
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,940
distribution between wins and losses

504
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,770
over any given set of criteria that

505
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,080
define your edge there's a random

506
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,380
distribution I will get a higher

507
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,540
percentage of wins two losses but I just

508
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,960
don't know which trades are going to be

509
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,370
it requires a complete shift in the way

510
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,320
you think about training when you make

511
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,590
this complete shift everything about

512
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,010
your training will change now I expect

513
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,270
you to make it now because I'm just

514
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,470
still getting out still we're still in

515
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,030
the introduction we won't really get

516
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,320
into the meat of this until a little bit

517
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,060
but this is this is where we're going

518
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,740
okay that's not what yet this is where

519
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,530
we're going they're going to be going to

520
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,970
genuine and learn how to think in

521
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,280
probabilities because when you've

522
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,740
integrated when you have genuinely

523
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,740
integrated these concepts into your

524
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,320
mental system at a functional level your

525
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,680
fear will go away you do not need to

526
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,590
lose everything to get to the point

527
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,210
where you can figure out that well you

528
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,340
know I've got nothing to lose anymore so

529
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,360
I don't have anything to be afraid of

530
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,210
you don't have to do that okay you don't

531
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,480
have to do that all you have to do is

532
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,850
commit yourself to learn how to think

533
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,310
about trading in another way and your

534
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,240
fear will go away

535
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,720
because what we're gonna learn is the

536
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,910
correlation between what we believe and

537
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,720
what we feel there's a direct

538
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,299
correlation between if I'm going into a

539
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,039
situation with a certain belief that

540
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,890
let's say that my particular edge is

541
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,020
going to tell me what's going to happen

542
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,450
on this trade right here I wouldn't even

543
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,160
put this trade on unless I thought I was

544
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,590
going to win when you really understand

545
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,270
the nature of price movement listen what

546
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,650
we're gonna get into after we go through

547
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,530
this section on skills when you really

548
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,850
understand that you will never think

549
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,130
that way again when you really

550
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,419
understand the nature of price movement

551
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,640
you won't think that way again and that

552
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,289
is one of the biggest problems that most

553
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:24,309
the typical trader has let's say the

554
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,770
typical screen-based trader is that is

555
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,150
that they really don't understand the

556
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,980
nature of how prices move and the

557
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,020
underlying dynamics because if you

558
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,610
haven't had the exposure you're you

559
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,620
haven't had the exposure to the direct

560
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,990
markets you're only exposure has been

561
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,960
those blips on the screen and as a

562
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,270
result there's a real gap in in

563
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,100
understanding about what's really

564
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,140
happening when you understand what's

565
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,330
behind those blips what's behind those

566
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,520
photons that show up on your screen when

567
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,080
you really understand that you will

568
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,640
think about trading in another way and

569
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,440
in a completely different way it won't

570
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,669
even occur to you to do some of the

571
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,409
things that you're doing now won't even

572
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,860
occur to you

573
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,390
okay now so I've got so we've got I've

574
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,550
given you three so far the next broad

575
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,960
area that you're going to have to learn

576
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,910
it's like it's like you can you could be

577
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,430
an expert at defining an edge you could

578
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,800
even you can even be able to execute

579
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,210
your trades flawlessly and but run into

580
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,510
the next challenge and that's what I

581
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,310
just call self sabotaging beliefs in

582
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:41,930
other words all of us have a sense of

583
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,830
self evaluation all of us have this this

584
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,160
sense that were what we're worth as a

585
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,510
person you might say and if if you were

586
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,900
to take like an old Ben Franklin

587
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,240
accounting scale okay and this is

588
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,640
positive and this is negative meaning if

589
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,310
you were to list every experience in

590
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,620
your life if you had let's say conscious

591
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,990
access to every experience in your life

592
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,420
that contributed to a positive sense of

593
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,760
self evaluation that yes I am a worthy

594
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,950
person because what we're running into

595
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,170
like I kind of got ahead of myself what

596
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,570
we're running into is this is that when

597
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,760
you learn how to define an edge and

598
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,740
learn how to execute your traits

599
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,980
flawlessly what's your what you're now

600
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,320
exposed to is the possibilities for

601
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,540
unlimited wealth there's really there's

602
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,740
really not there's really nothing

603
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,750
holding you back well let's put it this

604
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,560
way there's nothing on the outside

605
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,090
that's holding you back but there might

606
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,260
be something on the inside that's

607
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,740
holding you back those things on the

608
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,970
inside could be self sabotaging beliefs

609
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,190
in the sense that if you listed all the

610
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,660
experience that contributed to a

611
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,340
positive sense of self evaluation and

612
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,030
all experiences that that that

613
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,650
contributed to a negative sense of self

614
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,450
evaluation that I'm not worthy as a

615
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,400
person I feel guilty about this this

616
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,190
this and this that you could end up you

617
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,560
know you could you go you can go pup

618
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,140
plus negative or you know net positive

619
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,680
or net negative what could end up

620
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,200
happening is that if you don't have the

621
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,290
let's say the skills or the awareness to

622
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,419
realize that as your equity curve

623
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,600
as you start making money these internal

624
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,239
forces if you have net negative these

625
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,309
internal forces start building up to the

626
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,929
point where they'll cause you to make

627
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:32,629
unconscious trading errors where you're

628
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,100
not even really aware that you hit the

629
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,359
sell button instead on the buy button

630
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,669
those kinds of things if you have to you

631
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,019
have to become aware of when these

632
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,489
forces are starting to build up inside

633
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:46,460
of you and either compensate for it by

634
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,919
not trading by the stop trading or to

635
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,359
find a way to neutralize them and there

636
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,289
are there are various techniques

637
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,159
available but all I'm saying is that is

638
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,769
that these kinds of these kinds of

639
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,629
errors that are the results of self

640
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:01,220
sabotaging beliefs don't really have

641
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,830
anything to do with your direct trading

642
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,480
skills in other words your ability to

643
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,580
identify an edge and your ability to

644
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,619
execute your trade but they can have an

645
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,539
enormous impact on your equity curve I

646
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,330
would assume too that you would be

647
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,249
monitoring your equity curve and you

648
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,409
would start seeing your curve go down in

649
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,590
an abnormal way and you would start

650
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,590
looking for your whatever's happening to

651
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,609
you let's say you're not feeling well or

652
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,580
whatever your wife just divorced you I'm

653
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,039
just or maybe something yes all good

654
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,509
things right things that you're bringing

655
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,460
up I mean these what I'm saying is

656
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,769
though the you show two extremes a

657
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:45,710
normal drawdown and then the boom or

658
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,749
bust drawdown there must be some way to

659
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,499
know at least I'm looking for to know

660
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,809
when you start looking at your self

661
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,639
sabotaging that's my question good

662
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,590
question as a matter of fact there are

663
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,330
software programs available now that

664
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,070
will tell you that there are software

665
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,869
programs available that will tell you

666
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,419
when in other words give you an example

667
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,669
there's the example when I was working

668
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,619
with traders with especially like hedge

669
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,109
funds managers and and and and and

670
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:14,749
larger traders there are people first of

671
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:16,549
all there are people that that they're

672
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:19,489
their sole job was if they were let's

673
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:23,419
say they were central here let me about

674
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,320
how important this is

675
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,779
they had let's say this is there in the

676
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:33,140
middle and they've got and they've got

677
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,270
let's say you know 10 or 12 money

678
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,399
managers these are guys that all have

679
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,190
their managing funds okay this guy's

680
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,770
sole responsibility was to shift money

681
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,899
from here to here to here to each

682
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,169
manager based on chart patterns of their

683
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:56,480
equity curves in other words they would

684
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,899
chart the equity of these particular

685
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,360
traders just like price patterns in the

686
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,669
market to determine their potential for

687
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,950
inordinate ly large draw downs because

688
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,370
of self-sabotaging beliefs that's how

689
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,840
sophisticated the market has become

690
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,600
that's how relevant these issues are so

691
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,000
that you can actually chart your equity

692
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,570
and then you start to go like this oh

693
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,390
well and then do another one like that

694
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,779
something's happening here okay I mean

695
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,250
it was just it was really kind of

696
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,450
amazing to me when I was working with

697
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,580
floor traders especially I mean this one

698
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,320
guy this pops into my brain just as just

699
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,090
as you as we're talking about this I

700
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,919
mean you know he came in for a

701
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,440
consultation and he had his worst day in

702
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,330
his life ever worst trading day lost

703
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,740
more money than what he's ever lost in

704
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,140
his life and I said well you know and

705
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,480
it's like normally almost virtually in

706
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,370
every case it's something catastrophic

707
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,890
is happening in that person's life well

708
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,659
it's always amazing to me is how much of

709
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,299
a disconnect that that the person would

710
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,250
have between the catastrophic event in

711
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,929
their life and what they ended up doing

712
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,029
is the trader in the market I said well

713
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,649
you know what's going on and then he

714
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,419
just I just said what's going on and you

715
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,059
just he's kind of yeah well yeah my wife

716
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,740
when I had this really bad argument last

717
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,899
night and you know and I when I left you

718
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,070
know when I left for them for the

719
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,289
exchange this morning you know he

720
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:26,179
slapped his kids around and he kicked

721
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,669
his dog and you know looks like they

722
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,110
came in and Hanna's worst day and didn't

723
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,029
make the connection between what you

724
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:34,100
know between what happened what happened

725
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,659
at home and what he did on the floor

726
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,279
and he might have felt completely

727
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,799
justified in with the argument that he

728
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,509
had with his wife in slapping his kid

729
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,789
around and kicking the dog but that's

730
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,409
that's what's going on consciously but

731
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,179
let's say subconsciously you know

732
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,090
everyone has real estate if the person

733
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,619
is relatively normal now a psychopath

734
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,539
you know they've got they've got some

735
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,509
sense of fairness and and he feels

736
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,070
guilty about what he did and he took

737
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,470
that guilt out in the way he traded that

738
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:10,269
day the market is not a good arena to be

739
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,070
doing this by the way okay this is this

740
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,080
is not a good area to be working these

741
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,509
kind of emotional issues out go ahead we

742
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:19,840
need the microphone you want me to you

743
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,830
want me to put it right here and I'll

744
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:29,499
just I'll just hand it to him the the

745
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:32,109
market also changes the patterns of the

746
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,539
are your edge may change in relation to

747
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:37,480
the market to distinguish between your

748
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,809
own troubled state let's say and market

749
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,720
behavior I can see that maybe one of

750
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,999
these fellows here in the PI there might

751
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,340
be using a system that is not as valid

752
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,859
as it used to be when the market changes

753
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:52,809
how would you know if you were the guy

754
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,149
in the center whether he was just having

755
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,749
a bad stay with with whatever's going on

756
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:02,200
in his personal life versus a change in

757
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,940
his system in relation to the market

758
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,200
another good question

759
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,419
you wouldn't know immediately but upon

760
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:09,970
investigation you could find out in

761
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,289
other words by just talking to the guy

762
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:13,989
or what you or what you do is that see

763
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,970
see what you do is you trade in sample

764
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,769
sizes - in other words when you have a

765
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:19,539
particular methodology that has that has

766
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:21,429
a defined criteria for when you get into

767
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,649
a trade what you do is you trade in a

768
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,419
limited sample size so that if you

769
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,789
traded 25 trade sample sizes or like 20

770
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,679
or whatever what you do is you analyze

771
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,179
your results at the end of that at the

772
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:33,279
end of a sample size and if your results

773
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,869
are satisfying then what you do is you

774
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:36,789
take another sample size if the results

775
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:39,369
are not satisfying then because you all

776
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:40,779
because you knew exactly what you didn't

777
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,129
under what circumstances you did it

778
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,869
you've limited your variables what you

779
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,039
do is then you can go back and tweak

780
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,570
your variables to see if you can improve

781
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,149
your improve your results because

782
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,680
because what's your name because

783
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,390
timed with time was really bringing up

784
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,520
is the fact that you're right because

785
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,060
we're taking a limited set of variables

786
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,130
mathematical formula to that that's a

787
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,230
being applied to a dynamic event and

788
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,260
that dynamic event are traders who are

789
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,180
acting on their own behalf

790
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,260
creating price movement and they

791
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,540
basically they create patterns that were

792
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,770
they're doing the same thing over and

793
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,150
over again but you've got new people

794
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,920
coming in with new ideas and old people

795
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,140
leaving and as a result these patterns

796
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,300
can change over time diminishing the

797
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,160
results of them think of their edge so

798
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,360
what you want to do is you want to make

799
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,980
sure that your sample size is large

800
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,770
enough to adequately test that edge but

801
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,240
small enough so that if the edge is

802
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,030
diminishing in its effectiveness

803
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,380
you're not losing an inordinate amount

804
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,020
of money before you find that out to the

805
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,840
answer question so that's how they find

806
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,880
out okay besides that there are because

807
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,680
of their software available that'll even

808
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,210
tell you now there's software yeah

809
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,440
there's software available that I'll

810
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
that will track your track your edges or

811
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,210
to track your equity in a way that can

812
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,650
indicate whether or not you're ready to

813
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,300
take a hit I don't know the name of it

814
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,830
but you know cuz I just found out about

815
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,680
it myself so what are some other ways

816
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,480
that you can address maybe a emotional

817
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,190
problem you might be going through or

818
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,200
other things outside of the trading area

819
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,590
besides stock trading well you said

820
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,510
there I mean there there are a number of

821
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,680
techniques a number of books available

822
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,200
there's there's counseling you know I

823
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,640
mean I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a

824
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,320
recommendation of a particular book

825
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,090
later on you know when we get into a

826
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,860
little bit more detail but but you know

827
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,450
it's it depends on the effect that it

828
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,530
has on your trading I mean you don't

829
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,690
necessarily have to stop trading but you

830
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,250
all but you have to make an objective

831
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,170
assessment as to what you as to your

832
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,090
state of mind in other words you know

833
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,830
you can actually say to yourself am I in

834
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,300
the best state of mind to be trading

835
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,820
today and you know and the kind of

836
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,140
answer that you get back from yourself

837
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,610
you know if it's relatively objective

838
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,800
it's like if you're really not in the

839
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,990
best state of mind because of things

840
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,460
that are going on in your life and some

841
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,960
troubling aspects that you haven't

842
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,000
reconciled then but you don't want to

843
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,620
stop trading well at least you're aware

844
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,560
of it by in another another technique

845
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,330
would be by keeping journals because

846
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,310
most really good traders keep pretty

847
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,710
extensive journals over

848
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,940
about you know what they're doing and

849
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,900
what they're thinking while they're

850
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,880
doing it and then you make this

851
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,949
assessment so that at least if you're

852
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,320
not you don't want to stop trading you

853
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,909
still want to put your put whatever

854
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,889
edges on your half of that day you scale

855
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,989
back in other words if your maximum

856
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,360
position size is let's say five thousand

857
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,100
shares you're not in the best state of

858
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,270
mind maybe you only want to trade a

859
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,980
thousand maybe you only want to trade

860
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,739
500 in other words to take these things

861
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,510
into consideration and you'd be

862
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,370
surprised by just being aware of it and

863
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,290
taking into consideration a lot of times

864
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,480
these these things will reconcile

865
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,630
themselves I don't does that help you

866
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:46,330
yes it does thank you okay okay in the

867
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,510
last area of these broad skill sets that

868
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,940
we're talking about is develop the

869
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,500
ability to recognize if you've crossed

870
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,300
the threshold from normal self

871
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,370
confidence into a state of euphoria you

872
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,410
guys are laughing okay finally I finally

873
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,420
got some giggles I yeah giggles out of

874
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,400
you guys here oh what's so funny about

875
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,350
this anybody want to anyone you want to

876
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:16,480
want to share what what's that no you're

877
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
right I mean being in a stadium for you

878
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,430
let's put it this way

879
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,800
the primary let's say the the the

880
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,770
primary characteristic of the state of

881
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,610
euphoria is that it's a state of mind of

882
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,840
complete and absolute risk lessness

883
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,220
you everybody get what I just said

884
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,430
you are in a state of risk less nests in

885
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,380
other words you have no ability

886
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:45,970
whatsoever to perceive risk so if for an

887
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,300
example

888
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,710
if this line right here

889
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,230
if below this line represents normal

890
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:05,490
self-confidence and above this line is

891
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:11,550
euphoria and and this threshold is

892
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,020
different for everybody by the way I

893
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,790
mean there are certain chemicals that

894
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,500
scientists have found that you know that

895
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,450
that flutter that flood our mind in our

896
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,970
body when we've processed this threshold

897
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,580
I have I've worked with traders who will

898
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,230
flip into a state of euphoria with one

899
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,900
winning trade okay usually for most

900
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,280
people it takes more than one winning

901
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
trade but I have worked with I have

902
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,230
worked with people that they'll flip

903
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,580
into a state of euphoria with one

904
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,220
winning trade now the problem with this

905
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,780
and it's a great state of mind to be and

906
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,390
I mean to be in a in virtually a

907
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,070
riskless state of mind I mean it's like

908
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,830
hey you know the it's really a cool

909
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,160
place to be but the problem is that when

910
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,170
were in a state of euphoria as a trader

911
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,290
we are I mean it's it's virtually

912
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,280
guaranteed that we're gonna make a

913
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,680
trading error and the kind of trading

914
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,780
error that will make in a state of

915
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,550
euphoria usually has to do with position

916
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,760
size so for example if you're normal if

917
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,589
you're if you normally only trade a

918
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:11,190
thousand shares in a state of euphoria

919
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,250
it's like okay let's let's mortgage the

920
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,030
house okay it's like you know let's go

921
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,010
to ten thousand twenty thirty whatever

922
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,980
thousand shares because you see you

923
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,280
absolutely know for a fact you wouldn't

924
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,990
be putting on putting this trade on if

925
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,089
it wasn't gonna work so you know for you

926
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,510
know for a fact see that because there's

927
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,760
no cuz you don't have any any ability to

928
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,109
perceive risk at all

929
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,300
now the problem even though it could

930
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,010
even end up being a winning trade it's

931
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,290
not that it's not that the trade might

932
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,490
not end up being a winner but here's

933
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,810
typically what's going to happen if

934
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:53,520
you're a normal 1000 share trader if you

935
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,650
go up to 10,000 shares if when you put a

936
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,240
thousand shares on and the market went

937
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,869
against you five cents a share wouldn't

938
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:06,080
be any big deal

939
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,030
you've got 10,000 shares on when you

940
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,640
absolutely knew for a fact that the

941
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,240
trade was a winner and it goes five or

942
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,820
ten cents against you it has the

943
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,240
potential to flip you into a state of

944
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,400
pure unadulterated terror

945
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,950
instantaneously you go from euphoria to

946
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:41,880
a state of terror in one instant because

947
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,160
your expectations about what was going

948
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,820
to happen

949
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,010
we're so resolute it creates a

950
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,910
psychological shock that puts you in a

951
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,840
state of mind

952
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,900
freeze mind freeze mind freeze is when

953
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,240
you are conscious of what is happening

954
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,080
but find yourself totally immobilized to

955
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,310
do anything about it and so if the

956
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,470
market happens to go ten cents against

957
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,430
you but keeps on going okay you just sit

958
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,910
there and watch completely immobilized

959
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,240
while the market takes your money away

960
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,860
until finally something flips you out of

961
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,130
that and you say hey you know you just

962
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,420
come back to your senses and you had

963
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,330
enough and you get out of the trade I

964
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,350
know this probably never happened

965
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,400
anybody in this group but but but I've

966
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:46,950
worked with many people so this is not

967
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,830
something unfamiliar to anybody here

968
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,620
[Laughter]

969
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,060
that's it's like going literally from

970
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,260
home state of minds like literally going

971
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,060
from heaven to hell instantaneously and

972
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,220
keep in mind the dynamics here it was

973
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,550
all based on your expectation it's all

974
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,780
based on your expectation

975
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,299
so you guys have got this okay there's

976
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,670
so we're talking about consistency see

977
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,650
what this is goes back to when I was

978
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,530
doing the contrast okay is that to

979
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,539
experience a winning trade you need

980
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,940
nothing I'm not saying that you don't

981
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,059
put something into it but the fact is

982
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,130
you need nothing

983
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,210
there's no skills that are required to

984
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,990
experience a winning trade but to

985
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,990
experience consistent results as a

986
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,530
trader

987
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,150
there was the kind of results that you

988
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,839
can rely on as an income there are there

989
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,089
are these are there are some pretty kind

990
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,349
of profound skills that we're talking

991
00:40:53,349 --> 00:41:00,280
about are we not you've got to have an

992
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,260
edge you got to have a plan on how to

993
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,549
execute the edge you got to be able to

994
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,500
execute the plan flawlessly or at least

995
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,089
without you know without is minimum

996
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,260
number of errors or otherwise are gonna

997
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,569
detract from your results you got to be

998
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:13,000
able to recognize win you might have

999
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
some self sabotaging beliefs that are

1000
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,839
that are rising to the surface to say

1001
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,539
hey you know this is too much money why

1002
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:21,220
you why do you think it is you have

1003
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,289
probably read in the bud some of the

1004
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,240
training books I know I'm sure you have

1005
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,190
read at some point that someone gives

1006
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,359
you the advice that when you have

1007
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:30,430
windfall profits to stop trading and

1008
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,980
take a vacation why do you think that

1009
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,020
that advice exists why do you think

1010
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,450
people have written that down I just

1011
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,130
gave you the underlying dynamics for why

1012
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:48,869
that's true it's not just the euphoria

1013
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,859
no it's not just know it's not the

1014
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,390
terror afterward it's it's the

1015
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,579
possibility for self sabotaging beliefs

1016
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,829
coming in and saying I am NOT worth this

1017
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:03,510
much money even though it's what I want

1018
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,950
it's what I desire it's what I've been

1019
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,020
working for it doesn't mean that you

1020
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,020
believe you really deserve it you have

1021
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,910
to believe you really deserve it to keep

1022
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,089
it

1023
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,340
or at least recognize that you don't

1024
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,860
necessarily believe it and don't do

1025
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,560
anything to give it away in other words

1026
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,190
take a vacation put it in the bank let

1027
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,770
yourself get used to having it and and

1028
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,270
at which point you'll say you know what

1029
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,420
yeah you know I do deserve this money

1030
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,040
and then you'd be less likely to give it

1031
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:46,600
away the one of the best examples that I

1032
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,160
give that good because I could give you

1033
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,980
to illustrate this is a floor trader

1034
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,630
that I work on again another bond trader

1035
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,400
not as big as the other bond trader that

1036
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,630
I was that I that I referred to earlier

1037
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,240
he was a kind of trader who had this

1038
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,050
reputation as being completely

1039
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,410
consistent when when I met him he was he

1040
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,260
would make anywhere from I'd say fifteen

1041
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,970
to twenty thousand dollars a day that

1042
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,280
was his daily his daily thing okay

1043
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
day-in day-out

1044
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,320
fifteen twenty thousand dollars a day

1045
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,210
never had these catastrophic bad days

1046
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,060
that was his reputation and it was true

1047
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,990
so what do need me for well he he had

1048
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:36,480
hired a bunch of guys to trade his money

1049
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
thinking that he's gonna it'll live this

1050
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,450
is very common you kind of have a funny

1051
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,040
look but it's very common in Chicago

1052
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,650
where once you become successful and

1053
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,020
established what you want to do is is is

1054
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,360
bring in you know as many let's say

1055
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,120
bring in young talent that you can you

1056
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,260
know teach your particular techniques

1057
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,450
and just you know multiply what you make

1058
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,160
based on their efforts I mean that's you

1059
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,260
know but the problem is that the guys

1060
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,530
that he brought into his group they were

1061
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,870
you know I mean I don't know how to put

1062
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,790
it I want to be I want to be nice I want

1063
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,880
to they were just they were just

1064
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,310
basically leeches I mean they a lot of

1065
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,020
them when I you know talk to him it's

1066
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,060
like I don't even there's some some of

1067
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,380
them I don't even think wanted to be

1068
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,300
traders they just they just saw the

1069
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,330
opportunity to be able to get money from

1070
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,280
him for the opportunity to do something

1071
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,110
they hadn't done before and and it was

1072
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,440
you know it was

1073
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,940
these were not the kind of people that

1074
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,550
that you would that you would hire and

1075
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,160
under these circumstances they weren't

1076
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,599
really suited for it many cases weren't

1077
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,030
really suited for it at all especially

1078
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,369
the trade down on the floor so he wanted

1079
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,470
particularly you wanted ideas on how to

1080
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,839
you know how to how to build this this

1081
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,640
group up into you know a really

1082
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,089
successful trading group and while we

1083
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,940
were talking one day we had ordered

1084
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,339
lunch in somebody a delivery person came

1085
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:02,030
to with the lunch and he and he was a

1086
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,980
devout Catholic by the way this is a

1087
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,180
very important part of this he was a

1088
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,180
devout Catholic and he it's so devout

1089
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,040
that he carried a rosary with him all

1090
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,569
the time he had a rosary in his pocket

1091
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:17,030
and so when he he he paid you know took

1092
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,740
his wall out of his pocket paid for the

1093
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,470
lunch and he took the change and it just

1094
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,060
sort of unconsciously started to put the

1095
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,920
change in the same pocket with his

1096
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,440
rosary and then we realized what he was

1097
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,339
doing he took his hand out like that and

1098
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:33,140
I said well you know say what's going on

1099
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,780
yeah well you know I can't put money in

1100
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,710
can't can't have money touch the rosary

1101
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:42,530
and so we started exploring his beliefs

1102
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,650
about money and his beliefs about

1103
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,810
religion in relationship to money and

1104
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,190
certainly his beliefs about the Catholic

1105
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,859
Church and their beliefs about money and

1106
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:53,540
you know once they ended something he

1107
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,130
never really thought about but what he

1108
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,359
thought about you know the Catholic

1109
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:57,589
Church certainly doesn't believe that

1110
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:00,920
money is dirty so why should he believe

1111
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,849
that money is dirty in that respect in

1112
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,040
other words it's not spiritual to have

1113
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,089
money in a way that you know in a way

1114
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:13,069
that it can another was a dichotomy in

1115
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:15,800
his mind between his ability to his

1116
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,470
ability to make money in the pit and yet

1117
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,780
you would think that in a in this kind

1118
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,849
of a situation he would be giving his

1119
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,440
money away because he felt guilty about

1120
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,630
having it well he didn't give it away as

1121
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,310
a traitor because he was just too strong

1122
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,740
of a traitor to do it but he was giving

1123
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,109
it away in in with this organization the

1124
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:34,579
kind of people that he had around him in

1125
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:35,930
other words it wasn't going out the

1126
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,040
front door the money was going out the

1127
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,839
back door so he did find a way to to

1128
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,090
extract that money in about his

1129
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,330
about money religion the Catholic Church

1130
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,430
their beliefs about money realized that

1131
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,750
the you know the inconsistencies and and

1132
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,580
so as we're coming to kind of

1133
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,020
reconciliation about this

1134
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,490
I gave him an exercise to see if if in

1135
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,370
fact he'd really accepted what it is

1136
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,780
that we were talking about and what do

1137
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,010
you think the exercise was come on what

1138
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,630
do you think exercise was it's not that

1139
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,400
hard yes right put put put money in the

1140
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
pocket with the rosary put the money in

1141
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,150
the rosary together he couldn't do it he

1142
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:26,900
literally his his arm he tried to put

1143
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,080
the money in it was like it got it got

1144
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,710
like he could not do it his beliefs that

1145
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,780
we talked about were so strong that it

1146
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,580
literally wouldn't consciously let him

1147
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,290
do it but he worked on it see he he

1148
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,240
wanted to get to the point where he

1149
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,640
recognized the validity of the things

1150
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,500
that we were talking about and so he did

1151
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,960
want to do it so he kept on trying it

1152
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,620
took him about a week and once it got

1153
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,780
the money in with the rosary he had like

1154
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,850
all these conflicting beliefs he had

1155
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,260
about the nature of money in the guilt

1156
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,210
that he that he felt over it it just

1157
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,520
they just sort of all melted away and he

1158
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,060
fired all these people he didn't even

1159
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,710
try to make the traders because he

1160
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,150
realized that they you know these were

1161
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,860
not guys that you know that really

1162
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,270
wanted to be traders and he realized

1163
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,010
what he was doing he realized he was

1164
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,220
just he's just giving his money away

1165
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,330
what gives the professional trader the

1166
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,740
ability to execute their trades out air

1167
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,090
they are confident meaning there are no

1168
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,860
longer encumbered by the same fears that

1169
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,810
plagued the typical trader trading

1170
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,400
without fears has learned mental skills

1171
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,810
I've already given you examples of

1172
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,700
mental skills remember what we say but

1173
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,210
about the ability not to choke okay

1174
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,500
under that would be an example of a

1175
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,360
mental skill learning the trade without

1176
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,010
fear hesitation or internal conflicts as

1177
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,200
a function of believing that you don't

1178
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
have to know what's going to happen next

1179
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,890
on a trade by trade basis to win or make

1180
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,080
consistent money this is a good this is

1181
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,540
the heart of it right here everyone okay

1182
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,630
this is the heart of it and again we're

1183
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,840
still in the introduction believe

1184
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,130
not okay so I'm gonna reinforce all this

1185
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,420
but eventually what you're gonna do is

1186
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,190
get to the point where you believe that

1187
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,980
you do not have to know what is going to

1188
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,380
happen next on a trade by trade basis

1189
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,110
this trade and this particular trade in

1190
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,390
this particular trade you don't have to

1191
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,580
enter these trades thinking that you

1192
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,380
know it's going to happen next to win to

1193
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,680
make consistent money and that when you

1194
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,080
stop believing that you will start

1195
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,740
making consistent money because it's

1196
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,290
there it's your expectations about this

1197
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:34,530
trade winning that's that's gonna mess

1198
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,020
you up go ahead what you really saying

1199
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,580
is you have to have a belief in your

1200
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,160
plan or your methodology and you're

1201
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,960
looking for a probabilistic result

1202
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,760
saying over a period of time I will

1203
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,520
execute 60 70 80 % of my trades and one

1204
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,110
I'm going into now could be a good one

1205
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,580
could be a bad that's right I don't care

1206
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,490
that's right exactly right perfect thank

1207
00:49:53,490 --> 00:50:00,620
you this is where we're going okay

1208
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,970
thinking assuming or believing you know

1209
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,350
what will happen next creates an

1210
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,480
unrealistic expectation in a fascist in

1211
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,740
a specific outcome

1212
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,480
what's wrong with unrealistic

1213
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,110
expectation we'll think about let's say

1214
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,370
expectations in relationship to the the

1215
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:20,160
characteristics of humanity you get this

1216
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,070
cuts across all everybody and cuts

1217
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,440
across all cultural all cultural lines

1218
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,150
or barriers everyone it well first of

1219
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,740
all if you even get to that point what

1220
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,870
is an expectation an expectation is a

1221
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,790
mental representation in other words a

1222
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,930
belief an assumption or an opinion or

1223
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,940
whatever thinking assuming or believing

1224
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,930
a mental representation of what the next

1225
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,120
moment meaning next moment next five

1226
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,920
seconds or the next in ten seconds or

1227
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,230
the next hour or whatever is either

1228
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,580
going to in the environment in others

1229
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,500
they have a mental representation and we

1230
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,560
have an external environment that

1231
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,880
expresses itself okay so my mental

1232
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,340
representation meaning my expectation if

1233
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,190
the if the environment shows up in a way

1234
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,599
that is consistent with what I believe

1235
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:18,089
then what it what will my state of mind

1236
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:20,040
be this is a universal characteristic of

1237
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,079
humanity this isn't any different with

1238
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,810
anybody anywhere how will I feel what

1239
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,410
will be my state of mind what will be my

1240
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,460
experience I'll be in a state of

1241
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,130
satisfaction a state of well-being

1242
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,589
I could be joyous I could even end up in

1243
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:44,940
unit a state of euphoria the degree to

1244
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,920
which the environment does not express

1245
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,560
itself in a way that's consistent what I

1246
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,210
the way inconsistent with the way I

1247
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,670
think it's either gonna look like sound

1248
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,210
like taste like smell like or feel like

1249
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,950
okay I will be in a state of

1250
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:07,160
dissatisfaction the state of betrayal

1251
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:17,970
disgust anger fear terror your ability

1252
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,740
to create consistent results as a trader

1253
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,650
is all about what you expect when you

1254
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,160
change your expectations to be

1255
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,930
consistent with the way the environment

1256
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,240
the market environment exists the fear

1257
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,280
will go away when you change your

1258
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,200
expectations in a way that's consistent

1259
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,750
with the way the actual market

1260
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,180
environment exists your fear will go

1261
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,510
away

1262
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,440
and you'll be able to do exactly what

1263
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,740
you need to do when you need to do it

1264
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:02,200
without conflict without hesitation and

1265
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,930
be able to close that profit gap between

1266
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,520
what your methodology will give you in

1267
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,930
what you end up with in your bottom line

1268
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,700
unrealistic expectations cause us to

1269
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,320
define and interpret and therefore

1270
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,580
perceive market information as

1271
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,700
threatening ultimately we could look at

1272
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,500
we can break the market down to its

1273
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,040
lowest definable component parts if we

1274
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,570
break the market down to its lowest

1275
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,240
definable component parts what we end up

1276
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:36,430
with is up and down ticks okay an uptick

1277
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,740
an uptick is one incremental price

1278
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,920
change with a price move from one to two

1279
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,530
from two to three four five six whatever

1280
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,450
and then down ticks okay

1281
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,480
when we're operating out of unrealistic

1282
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,510
expectations we're going to tap into

1283
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,270
four primary trading fears that will

1284
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,040
cause all the errors that we make as

1285
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,520
traitors those fears are the fear of

1286
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,920
being wrong losing money missing out and

1287
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,990
leaving money on the table

1288
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,050
and those fears will actually cause us

1289
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,080
to perceive these up and down ticks as

1290
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,970
threatening and what we're going to

1291
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:20,170
learn about the nature of fear a little

1292
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,330
later is that fear will cause us to

1293
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,980
focus on the object of our fear so that

1294
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,810
we end up creating the very experience

1295
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,090
we're trying to avoid therefore if I'm

1296
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,820
trying if I'm afraid of being wrong I

1297
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,830
will actually perceive this information

1298
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,260
in a way that causes me to be wrong if

1299
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,450
I'm afraid of losing I will perceive

1300
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,040
these up-and-down ticks in a way that

1301
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,440
will actually cause me to lose if I'm

1302
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,450
afraid of missing out I'll actually

1303
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,640
create the experience of missing out and

1304
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,020
if I'm afraid of leaving money on the

1305
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,790
table that's exactly what I'll end up

1306
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:53,710
doing now when you think about the

1307
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,090
nature of these up-and-down ticks and

1308
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,800
the photons that appear on your computer

1309
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,070
screens is is there is there an inherent

1310
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,540
characteristic and that information

1311
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,630
that's threatening in any way

1312
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,280
in other words it is it is that

1313
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,770
information is in other words when we

1314
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,600
talk about the nature of emotional pain

1315
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,030
which is which is the threat of pain

1316
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,940
okay the fear not physical pain where if

1317
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,240
we have all of us have a normal nervous

1318
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,790
system and we come into contact with a

1319
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,130
physical object object you know if I hit

1320
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,320
this with my arm it's going to hurt if

1321
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,400
you hit it with your arm is going to

1322
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,450
hurt so so we've got some universal

1323
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:34,240
commonality but with emotional pain it's

1324
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,800
not that way at all although we think

1325
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,190
that it is that's not because emotional

1326
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,210
pain requires an interpretation and then

1327
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,350
interpretation comes from what we

1328
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,360
believe you guys with me on this on the

1329
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,480
interpretation part because see the

1330
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,580
information itself the up and down ticks

1331
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,730
have no charge to them whatsoever

1332
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,020
they're not positively or negatively

1333
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:04,020
charged they're just up and down ticks

1334
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,430
that based on your ability to read those

1335
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,470
up-and-down ticks tell you what the what

1336
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:13,060
the potential is for the market to move

1337
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,810
in any particular direction

1338
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,310
if you're perceiving them as threatening

1339
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,170
in some way that's definitely going to

1340
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,610
cause you problems when it comes to

1341
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,440
creating consistent results in fact

1342
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,520
you're going to find it impossible

1343
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,170
okay let's talk about some typical

1344
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,120
trading errors the typical trading is

1345
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,750
the professional has evolved beyond

1346
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,190
don't define the risk in advance of

1347
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,340
putting on a trade why in the world of

1348
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,870
all the trading books that you've ever

1349
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,650
read out of all the workshops you've

1350
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,320
probably been to I'm sure that you have

1351
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,630
been exposed to this particular piece of

1352
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:11,160
advice countless times and yet it is it

1353
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,090
is the primary trading error that people

1354
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,520
commit all the time they don't

1355
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,980
predefined the risk in advance of

1356
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,890
putting on a trade if you don't

1357
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,440
predefined the risk in advance you're

1358
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,390
operating out of the mindset that you

1359
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,590
think you know what's going to happen

1360
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,650
next and what I'm going to establish

1361
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,300
from you when you establish for you when

1362
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,100
we get into the next section is that

1363
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,760
that is absolutely not the case

1364
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,410
it doesn't mean we don't think that but

1365
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:45,810
the reality is it isn't the case see

1366
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,640
because when we have we predefined our

1367
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,310
risk let's put it this way if if I'm a

1368
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,410
typical trader operating out of the four

1369
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,210
fundamental fears the fear of being

1370
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,190
wrong the fear of missing out losing

1371
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:59,100
money etc we got a real problem here

1372
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,530
because our minds are naturally wired to

1373
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:06,270
associate in other words they automatic

1374
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,830
our minds will automatically make

1375
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:12,030
connections meaning this that if I if

1376
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm I get into a trade and I end up

1377
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,480
being wrong I expect it to win and I'm

1378
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,810
wrong I have to admit that I'm wrong

1379
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,340
it isn't just admitting that I'm wrong

1380
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:28,110
on this one trade our minds because the

1381
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,910
way our minds are wired it has the

1382
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,180
potential to tap us into the accumulated

1383
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,120
the accumulated the accumulated negative

1384
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,920
energy of every time I've been wrong in

1385
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,780
my life okay so if this circle

1386
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,210
represents a huge ball of negative

1387
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,410
energy you

1388
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,000
inside of our mental environment about

1389
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,589
what it means to be wrong

1390
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:52,950
being wrong on just one trade could tap

1391
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,079
us into that pain and it's going to work

1392
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,369
differently for everybody everyone's

1393
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:57,660
minds work so it works a little bit

1394
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,369
differently but that's the potential if

1395
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,530
you wonder why people seem to live and

1396
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,569
die on the outcome of the next trade

1397
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:06,780
this is one of the reasons why this is

1398
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,539
why it's so important because it has the

1399
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:15,539
potential to tap us into the accumulated

1400
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:18,240
negative pain of every time we've been

1401
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,309
wrong in our lives every time we've lost

1402
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:22,079
something in our lives every time we've

1403
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,460
missed out on an opportunity that we

1404
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,410
didn't take advantage of every time

1405
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,480
we've been in an opportunity and didn't

1406
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,309
get the maximum amount that was

1407
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:36,480
available those are the four fears so

1408
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,920
the problem with pre defining our risk

1409
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,160
as this is that if I'm afraid of being

1410
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,809
wrong and I don't know how to think

1411
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:47,130
about trading appropriately in a

1412
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,130
probabilistic mindset I'm not going to

1413
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,079
get into this trade unless I think I'm

1414
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,799
right and the problem with pre defining

1415
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,180
the risk is that it requires that I

1416
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,619
gather evidence as the why it might not

1417
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,440
work

1418
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,180
pre defining your risk requires that you

1419
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,099
gather evidence as to why it might not

1420
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,440
work well I wouldn't even be getting it

1421
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,670
into in the first place if that were the

1422
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:11,670
case so I'm not gonna I'm going to

1423
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,529
gather as much evidence as possible to

1424
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:18,470
make sure that I'm doing the right thing

1425
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,109
because if I start gathering evidence as

1426
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:24,539
to why it might not work then I might

1427
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:29,369
talk myself out of taking the trade and

1428
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:30,750
then if I end up talking myself out of

1429
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,950
taking the trade and it turns out to be

1430
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,380
a winner I'll probably be in more

1431
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,760
emotional pain than what I would have

1432
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,589
been in had I taken the trade and it

1433
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:44,819
turned out to be a loser so I just make

1434
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:46,589
sure that I've got all my ducks in a row

1435
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:48,390
and I don't take the trade unless they

1436
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:53,190
do and therefore what I have done now

1437
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,859
think about this what I have essentially

1438
01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:00,240
done is define the risk out of the trade

1439
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,060
I've gone through a mental process in

1440
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,270
which I have literally defined the risk

1441
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:13,200
out of the trade why do I have to put a

1442
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,670
stop in the market and predefined my

1443
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:17,990
risk if I know I'm gonna win a

1444
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,520
professional trader just doesn't think

1445
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,490
that way they would not I'm not saying

1446
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,140
that they never thought that way I'm not

1447
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,640
saying that that they didn't experience

1448
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,410
the exact same thought process that I

1449
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,480
just took you through I'm saying they

1450
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,480
have evolved beyond it they would never

1451
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,250
allow themselves to get into a trade

1452
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,359
without pre defining the risk and elbows

1453
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,890
what does the market look like sound

1454
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:42,540
like or feel like to tell me this trade

1455
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:46,230
isn't working the next error to find the

1456
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,670
risk but don't take the loss and it

1457
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,400
turns out to be a bigger loss that's

1458
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,720
probably again one of those things that

1459
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,130
never happened anybody in this room but

1460
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,890
just in case someone watches the DVD

1461
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,730
where this sort of thing has happened I

1462
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:06,589
included it same dynamics basically

1463
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,180
hesitate get into late yr gonna hesitate

1464
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,890
why you're gonna hesitate to get in if

1465
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,690
you're if the criteria that used to

1466
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,849
define an edge define an edge is present

1467
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:20,210
in this moment why would you hesitate

1468
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,660
because you don't think the trades gonna

1469
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:29,190
work you have doubt in other words

1470
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,190
you're either thinking believing or

1471
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,450
assuming that you know what's going to

1472
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,930
happen next think of the connection here

1473
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,339
you couldn't hesitate unless you either

1474
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,230
assumed think or believed that you know

1475
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,660
what's going to happen next if you

1476
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,950
operate out of the perspective that you

1477
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,300
don't know what's going to happen next I

1478
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,230
don't need to know what's going to

1479
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,060
happen next egg money then there's no

1480
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:58,380
point in hesitating jump the gun get

1481
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,640
into soon where the signal never

1482
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,460
actually develops coming off of a

1483
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,540
winning trade you're gonna jump the

1484
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,830
gunman to come off a winning trade or a

1485
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,780
series of winning trades right and

1486
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,580
you're just so excited about what you

1487
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,140
see developing yeah

1488
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,960
signal isn't quite there yet but you

1489
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,690
know what let's get in before everyone

1490
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,980
else and you never actually get a signal

1491
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,940
that's a training error now see the

1492
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,079
point that doesn't mean that you

1493
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,059
couldn't win see what you're gonna find

1494
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,099
is that when you trade on what I call a

1495
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:31,650
trade by trade basis so we're gonna make

1496
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,240
the we're gonna make the distinction

1497
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,849
between trading trade by train and chair

1498
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:37,920
trading over a series of trades when you

1499
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,019
trade trade by trade it means that each

1500
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:42,569
individual trade is like a life or death

1501
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,430
thing in other words I I wouldn't be

1502
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,809
putting this trade on if I didn't think

1503
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:48,869
this trade was going to win not that not

1504
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:52,650
the other the the the the opposite of

1505
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,260
that was which is I'm going to put on

1506
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,119
the next twenty trades because I think

1507
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,940
that 70 or 75 percent of them or 50% of

1508
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,849
them are going to win it was a huge

1509
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:05,930
difference in perspective

1510
01:04:11,069 --> 01:04:13,660
so if you're coming off a winning trade

1511
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,599
or a series of wins you're likely to

1512
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,880
jump the gun but the interesting part

1513
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,099
about all this is that each one of these

1514
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:24,339
errors and I'm giving you could all

1515
01:04:24,339 --> 01:04:27,549
result in a winning trade you could do

1516
01:04:27,549 --> 01:04:29,109
every single one of these things and

1517
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:31,470
still win

1518
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:35,650
you could not free to find your risk and

1519
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:36,849
still find yourself in a winning trade

1520
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:38,619
you can hesitate and find out what

1521
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:40,359
exactly exactly the right thing to do in

1522
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:42,400
that moment you can jump the gun and

1523
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,660
find out it is exactly the right thing

1524
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,869
to do in that moment you could not take

1525
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:48,279
your loss and the market comes back in

1526
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:50,799
your favor all these airs that we're

1527
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,630
talking about you can commit over and

1528
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,880
over again and they could end up having

1529
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,410
you can end up experiencing positive

1530
01:04:56,410 --> 01:05:01,650
results except one thing one thing is

1531
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:04,539
that when you indulge yourself in

1532
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:09,400
behaviors in these kinds of behaviors it

1533
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,130
could lead to usually a no but then that

1534
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:14,259
could it virtually every time leads to a

1535
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:19,719
catastrophic loss catastrophic you put

1536
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:21,160
on a train without predefined in your

1537
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,779
wrist three or four times over in a row

1538
01:05:22,779 --> 01:05:26,710
and turns out to be a winner and then

1539
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,700
the next one you don't do it that's the

1540
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,989
one that's gonna be the catastrophic

1541
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:37,989
loss see so on a trade by trade basis

1542
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:40,390
you can do anything for any reason and

1543
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,460
commit any error or what would be

1544
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,979
considered an error in the perspective

1545
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,839
of trying to create consistency and

1546
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:48,460
still win and still have winning tarik

1547
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,009
streaks and still have a lot of fun but

1548
01:05:51,009 --> 01:05:52,089
you're setting yourself up for

1549
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:55,319
catastrophic losses

1550
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,920
get out of a winning trade too sooner to

1551
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,560
leave money on the table there's there

1552
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,640
isn't a traitor alive who hasn't

1553
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,130
experienced that let a winning trade

1554
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,810
turn into a loser without having taking

1555
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:12,140
any profits all these errors are the

1556
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:15,470
result of thinking assuming or believing

1557
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,840
that we know what's going to happen next

1558
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,040
we will stop closer to an entry point

1559
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,840
get stopped out and the market trades

1560
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,840
back in your favour in other words what

1561
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,120
would that tell you if you if you're

1562
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,970
here if you buy at this price right here

1563
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:32,150
and you put your stop here this is all

1564
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,680
you're really saying is that this is

1565
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,880
this is how far I'm going to let the

1566
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,620
market trade against my position to tell

1567
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,320
me that this trade is either not working

1568
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,930
at all or that the potential for

1569
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:43,340
twerking is so diminished that it's not

1570
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,280
worth me staying in any longer and then

1571
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,870
the market starts to drift down to your

1572
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,710
stop and then you move your stop up and

1573
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,360
begin to get stopped out and then the

1574
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,970
market does this what would that tell

1575
01:06:55,970 --> 01:07:01,100
you about your attitude what yeah and

1576
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,240
you hadn't accepted the risk of that

1577
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,940
trade did you see do you see when people

1578
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,320
can put stops in the market it doesn't

1579
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,590
mean they've really accepted the risk

1580
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:11,000
you could put a stop in the market but

1581
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,410
it doesn't mean you've genuinely

1582
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,440
accepted the risk this would tell me

1583
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,970
someone came to me and said mark this is

1584
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,650
what I did this is what I know I know

1585
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,940
that you didn't accept the risk of that

1586
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:24,400
trader you wouldn't move the stop what

1587
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,630
yeah you can move the other way too you

1588
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,280
know because well that's because y'all

1589
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:36,410
want to meet you wrong the professional

1590
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:37,850
trader is no longer susceptible these

1591
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,200
typical trading errors because he's

1592
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,210
learned to think in probabilities when

1593
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,920
you understand the relationship between

1594
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,320
how prices move and the mathematical

1595
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,060
formulas and price patterns that make up

1596
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,460
a trading methodology patterns that make

1597
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,050
up a trading method it quantifies that

1598
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,850
moving into tradable edges then why you

1599
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:54,290
have to learn the skill of thinking

1600
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,550
probabilities will become self-evident

1601
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,990
in other words when we get through the

1602
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,360
next section the way you need to think I

1603
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,800
want you guys to be at a point where it

1604
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,890
just becomes completely self-evident as

1605
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:04,910
to why you need to think in

1606
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,850
probabilities to make consistent money

1607
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,200
it just makes sense it's just like oh

1608
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,630
yeah okay this makes absolute sense

1609
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,430
the three developmental modes of trading

1610
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,220
now I gave you the broad skill sets that

1611
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,260
you have to learn to create consistency

1612
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,800
well then with those broad skill sets

1613
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,109
are within the three what I call three

1614
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:28,880
developmental modes of training there's

1615
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,740
mechanical trading subjective training

1616
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,620
and intuitive trading there's three

1617
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,260
stages in other words in mechanical what

1618
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,090
you want to do is you wanna you want to

1619
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:41,420
trade with rigid a rigid criteria that

1620
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,180
defines your edge all execution

1621
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,859
decisions are made in advance of market

1622
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,870
activity the market either confirms your

1623
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:50,270
conforms your definition of an edge or

1624
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,180
not and you execute your your executor

1625
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,680
trades based on a plan in other words

1626
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,960
what you're doing within the mechanical

1627
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,700
mode of trading is you're limiting the

1628
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,170
number of variables that you're dealing

1629
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,210
with in the market because what you want

1630
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,710
to find out is this you want to find out

1631
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,149
what works and what doesn't this is

1632
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,710
where to find out what works and what

1633
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,450
doesn't you can pay per trade in other

1634
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,220
words you can you can actually take a

1635
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,779
particular trading strategy and

1636
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:16,819
methodology and forward trade it with

1637
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,439
paper trading or if you've got software

1638
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:20,330
that does analysis for you can do it

1639
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,640
that way too but it's better than

1640
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,859
probably paper traded so that you're

1641
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,720
actually interacting with your

1642
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,850
particular variables that are defining

1643
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,890
an edge so you're finding out what works

1644
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,479
and what doesn't if you use an unlimited

1645
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,189
number of variables and define an edge

1646
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:35,990
we were trading randomly you never never

1647
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,760
find out what works and what doesn't so

1648
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,170
you have to learn that you have to have

1649
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,810
confidence in that but the other part of

1650
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,140
it too

1651
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,060
is finding out whether or not your own

1652
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,630
personal psychology is made up in a way

1653
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,130
that you can actually execute that edge

1654
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:51,529
and the problem with the execution part

1655
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,359
of it is that paper trading doesn't cut

1656
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,520
it you actually have to have money on

1657
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,240
the line and so what you do in the

1658
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,980
mechanical stage that you use the

1659
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:03,560
mechanical stage as a means to learn

1660
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,710
trading skills in other words your focus

1661
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,960
is on skills and not necessarily on how

1662
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,930
much money you're making or not making

1663
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,770
because when you've acquired the

1664
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,810
appropriate skills the money will simply

1665
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,730
just be a byproduct of those skills and

1666
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:21,530
then what you do is that if you find

1667
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,450
that you cannot execute your plan

1668
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:26,940
then you're gonna have to going to have

1669
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,249
to get into a mode where you learn

1670
01:10:29,249 --> 01:10:30,479
exactly how to do that which is what

1671
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,130
we're gonna get into later on but the

1672
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:34,170
point is is that that that what I

1673
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,880
recommend to people is that if they're

1674
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,409
having problems executing their trades

1675
01:10:37,409 --> 01:10:38,760
in most cases is because they're

1676
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,979
probably they're probably their position

1677
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:43,650
size is too large in other words if

1678
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:45,659
they're if once they once they will

1679
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,559
learn that they that that there's a

1680
01:10:48,559 --> 01:10:51,510
specific regimen in which they can learn

1681
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:54,749
to be consistent you know what they want

1682
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:56,159
to do is they want they want they want

1683
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,289
their cake and eat it to sort of know

1684
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:01,860
they want to learn the techniques but

1685
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,090
they don't want to cut themselves off

1686
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,860
from still making a lot of money

1687
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,840
when the reality is they don't have the

1688
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,159
psychological skills to be able to

1689
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,840
execute trades based on the way they're

1690
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,300
trading before so there were 5000 share

1691
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,030
trader before they'll set up these

1692
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:16,170
exercises that we're going to talk about

1693
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,570
later on the afternoon with 5,000 shares

1694
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,429
and then and then completely blow it and

1695
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:21,860
can't do it

1696
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,840
the reality is their psychological

1697
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,880
makeup is such that they may only be

1698
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,130
able to trade do it and do it flawlessly

1699
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:33,210
with 10 shares so I've worked with

1700
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:41,400
people who had to go down to one to be

1701
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,199
able to execute it flawlessly they had

1702
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:47,159
to go down to one share and then they

1703
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,019
work their way up and then they go to

1704
01:11:49,019 --> 01:11:50,550
two and then they go to five they go to

1705
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,679
ten and they just work their way up I

1706
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:57,780
mean is there any but in this room who

1707
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,889
hasn't paper traded and who is there

1708
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:03,929
anybody who has an experience being able

1709
01:12:03,929 --> 01:12:05,760
to execute your trades flawlessly on

1710
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,909
paper but that when you when you try to

1711
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,920
execute a plan with real money it

1712
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,429
doesn't work see the plans the plans

1713
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:16,800
work in your not working this is what

1714
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,300
mechanical trading is all about okay

1715
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,219
mechanical trading is finding out just

1716
01:12:20,219 --> 01:12:25,409
how big that gap is you cannot take for

1717
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:26,999
granted that because you recognize an

1718
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:28,920
opportunity to enrich yourself in some

1719
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,599
way that you have the skills and be able

1720
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:32,179
to take advantage of it appropriately

1721
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:35,070
you can't take it for granted and most

1722
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,760
everybody does

1723
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,960
so mechanical trading gives you all this

1724
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,420
information it gives you it tells you

1725
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,280
what works and what doesn't in the

1726
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,930
market and what works and what doesn't

1727
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:57,970
with you so that you know what you need

1728
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,440
to focus on to be able to make

1729
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,350
consistent money you guys you guys with

1730
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:05,890
me on this is it making sense okay then

1731
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:08,350
you can evolve if you want to the

1732
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,790
subjective stage of training because you

1733
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,350
can make consistent money training

1734
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:14,530
mechanically okay that's I mean it's but

1735
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,690
most people like to be able to use their

1736
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,910
their rational thinking in process and

1737
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:20,590
try to figure things out and the

1738
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,240
subjective stage of training is simply

1739
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,040
this is a broader more flexible mode of

1740
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,240
training where you use everything you've

1741
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,340
ever learned about the price movement to

1742
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,350
determine your edges in other words you

1743
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,550
know all the different patterns you've

1744
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,490
learned all the different nuances of

1745
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:35,590
market behavior will determine you know

1746
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,780
where you get in how much profit you

1747
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:42,040
take where you set your stops you see in

1748
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,260
the subjective mode of trading in the

1749
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,360
subjective mode if someone said to me

1750
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,680
okay

1751
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,730
I'm buying here and my stop is here but

1752
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,110
the mark is starting to come down to my

1753
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,290
stop and I get out right here and I

1754
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,820
don't let my stop get I don't let myself

1755
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,650
get stopped out of my original spot in

1756
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,600
the it truly for someone who's evolved

1757
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,680
to the subjective mode of training

1758
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,970
that's alright you can do that because

1759
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,740
you're not doing out of fear and you're

1760
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,790
not doing it out of the fact that you

1761
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,260
haven't accepted the risk you're doing

1762
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,730
it because you recognize the pattern

1763
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,620
that the market is giving you is such

1764
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,600
that there's a high probability you are

1765
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,040
gonna get stopped out and so therefore

1766
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,590
you must scratch a trader or get out

1767
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,140
with it with a little bit of a loss it's

1768
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,760
not because you're afraid there's a huge

1769
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,920
difference you guys with me on this

1770
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,590
and then the last stage is the intuitive

1771
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,699
this is the most advanced mode of

1772
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:41,080
trading it would be the equivalent to

1773
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,580
getting a black belt in martial arts

1774
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,949
it's when you find yourself in the zone

1775
01:14:44,949 --> 01:14:46,780
tapped into the collective consciousness

1776
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,179
of the market giving you a sense of the

1777
01:14:49,179 --> 01:14:53,199
flow if you look at the market as being

1778
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,780
you know a collection of individuals you

1779
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,340
can tap into that you can find

1780
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,449
yourselves not something you will

1781
01:14:58,449 --> 01:15:00,610
yourself into you just find yourself

1782
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:02,890
into in this zone where you're just

1783
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,260
seeing and doing things that you can't

1784
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,960
necessarily explain at a rational level

1785
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,360
and the problem is that there are people

1786
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,670
everyone has intuitive capabilities

1787
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,530
there are but but some people that's

1788
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,780
completely shut off and with others you

1789
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,760
know they don't trust it because you

1790
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,010
know they they don't they can't make the

1791
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,340
distinction between what's intuition and

1792
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,429
what's just their mind hoping that

1793
01:15:27,429 --> 01:15:29,830
something's gonna happen or hoping that

1794
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:32,590
you know what they see is really what's

1795
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,540
going on and making it feel like

1796
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:38,350
intuition the problem is until you

1797
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,030
acquire these fundamental skills that

1798
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,770
we're talking about you definitely don't

1799
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,780
want to be trading based on intuitive

1800
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,270
impulses you just want to make note of

1801
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,160
them when you've got the skills then

1802
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,750
find yourself in the zone then go ahead

1803
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,910
and do whatever whatever comes to your

1804
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,739
brain until you flip yourself out of

1805
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:55,270
that meaning when you start thinking at

1806
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,010
a rational level you mostly do flip

1807
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,060
yourself right out of that right out of

1808
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,330
the zone because your rational mind

1809
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:03,640
wants to know wants reasons your

1810
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,770
rational mind wants logical reasons and

1811
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,989
these intuitive impulses don't come from

1812
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:09,550
that part of your brain they come from

1813
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:11,500
that creative part of your brain and by

1814
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,260
definition creativity is bringing

1815
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,580
something forth that didn't previously

1816
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,830
exist they exist somewhere in the world

1817
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,510
or in the universe somewhere but it

1818
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,550
didn't exist in your mind and it's

1819
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,050
outside the parameters of what you

1820
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,810
already believe so there's going to be

1821
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,580
an instant conflict between what you

1822
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,320
think at a rational level and your

1823
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,690
intuitive impulses until you train your

1824
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,070
rational mind to accept your intuitive

1825
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:36,660
impulses got that

1826
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,630
[Laughter]
