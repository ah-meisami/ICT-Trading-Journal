1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,090
in this fourth section I will cover the

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,710
underlying dynamics of confidence and

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,990
fear so that you can build a framework

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,490
for understanding how to create a

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,780
carefree state of mind when you trade ok

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,219
the next section that we're going to get

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,730
into is exploring the dynamics of

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,710
confidence and fear in other words what

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,010
what was the from this morning and in

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
just a little while ago not so much a

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,130
little while ago especially from this

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,009
morning what's the primary problem why

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,559
why why do we have so much of a problem

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,050
or what creates the problem with the

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,930
tuna trade by trade perspective in other

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,270
words if I'm looking at the market if my

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,940
technical indicator gives me a signal to

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,730
buy right now

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,050
ok what's in a buy and if I'm not pre

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,739
defining my risk if I'm hesitating if

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,829
I'm jumping the gun if I'm you know if I

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,050
put my trade on and and and you know I

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,449
want to move my stop what is it that's

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,180
going on right now what's compelling me

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,670
to make these kinds of errors fear and

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,869
and what's behind the fear ok but that's

27
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,479
good but I want but yeah because you

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
don't want to get tapped into being

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,689
wrong losing missing out all that other

30
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,330
all that pain but remember I said what

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,740
was what was a universal characteristic

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,729
of all humanity

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,130
in terms of how we feel about our

34
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,799
expectations being fulfilled

35
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,000
well yeah but you all know where they

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,470
are but what I'm saying is that it's

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,180
because I'm expecting this trade to work

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,380
ok once you got you guys got to get this

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,960
ok the reason why I'm having a problem

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,780
is because I'm expecting this trade to

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,420
work this trade it's not because I'm

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,579
thinking that I've got a I've got a

43
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,700
series of trades remember the pattern

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
with the pattern within flipping the

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,930
coin the pattern is that if I've got an

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,699
edge well I'll give you another example

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,949
let's say that I've got a coin that's

48
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,380
waited waited

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,480
whether you're on the tail side so that

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,220
it's going to come up on a percentage

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,020
basis 65% of the time heads and I get

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,980
someone to take the other side of a bet

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,940
where I get to call the flip every time

54
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,420
what am I going to do am I gonna try to

55
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,150
determine win tails is going to that 35

56
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,650
percent of times tails is going to come

57
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,990
up

58
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,420
I'm gonna call heads every time that's a

59
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,500
pattern okay the way it relates here is

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,350
that I've got a technical methodology

61
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,820
that gives me winning trades let's say

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,050
65 percent of the time I don't know

63
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,960
which of those of the next 20 trades or

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
25 trades that come up I don't know

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,340
which ones are going to be the winners

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,300
and which ones are going to be the

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,450
losers if I'm going to trade my

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,670
methodology appropriately that really

69
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,830
obligates me to take every single trade

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,230
I can't be picking and choosing my

71
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,790
trades based on what I think is going to

72
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,560
happen because I hopefully I've already

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,890
established you don't know if you think

74
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,150
you know you're just making it up in

75
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,910
your own mind I'm gonna repeat that if

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,770
you think you know you're just making it

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,090
up is this is everybody alright with

78
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,660
what I just said

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,459
and so it obligates me to take every

80
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,069
single trade that comes up because I

81
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,450
don't know which ones are going to be

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,590
the winners and which ones are going to

83
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,209
be the losers it means that if I'm

84
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,140
having problems it's because I have a

85
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,680
certain expectation about this trade or

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:08,800
about this trade or about this one so

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,739
what if I'm expecting a random outcome

88
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,139
what if I change my expectations well I

89
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:25,900
feel differently about it if I change my

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,700
expectations while I feel differently

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,030
about it is there anybody in this room

92
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,250
do does anybody who trades look what I

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,290
ever it's been in this way I don't think

94
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,210
I've ever met anybody who trades who

95
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,580
hasn't at least gambled at some point in

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,180
their lives right what do you expect

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,560
when you put money into a slot machine

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,660
and push the button good one of those

99
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,410
that's was goodbye I like that what else

100
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,789
loud if every the same thing what are

101
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,039
you expecting really on this one

102
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,090
seriously what do you expect

103
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,900
yeah what do you know what you're

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,400
expecting you're expecting something to

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,220
happen right you're expecting the wheels

106
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,400
to turn you're expecting something to

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,410
show up now think about what I'm just

108
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,190
saying because you know what what I just

109
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,990
said is exactly what I expect when I put

110
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,330
on a trade I'm expecting something to

111
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,389
happen I don't know what but over a

112
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,330
series of trades if I do everything

113
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,590
right I'll make money because I'm

114
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,200
managing my expectations on each one of

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,150
these trades I'm managing my

116
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,070
expectations so that I do not have the

117
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,260
potential to define and interpret these

118
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,050
up-and-down ticks the information the

119
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,159
market gives me and some sort of

120
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,630
threatening or painful way because what

121
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,889
I'm going to tell you what are we

122
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,120
get into now is the effects of that when

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,460
you put money what's that what do you

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,139
mean how realistic go ahead no no take

125
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,020
the microphone how realistic is a 65%

126
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,529
win ratio on your methodology I'm not

127
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:18,969
understanding the question how realistic

128
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,180
is it well if you can't go by any

129
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,150
individual specific trade which you say

130
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,650
over 20 trades you can say you expect to

131
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,840
win 65% of the time correct that based

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,189
on past performance okay but then again

133
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:40,680
looking at over any individual 20 or 50

134
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,439
sample how realistic is maybe that's 65

135
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,300
percent saying that you are that's a

136
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,050
real number

137
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,050
I'll find out I don't know I don't know

138
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,759
how will I know how could I know I'll

139
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,819
find out that's why you trade in sample

140
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,089
sizes that are limited in other words I

141
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,159
don't make an assessment of how well

142
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,870
it's working until after the end of a

143
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,990
sample size if if at the end of a sample

144
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,330
size I get a high enough percentage of

145
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,330
winning trades than where I'm satisfied

146
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,180
then I'll take another sample size if I

147
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,279
don't then I'll find ways to tweak my

148
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,389
indicators to improve my results so for

149
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,520
you to say how realistic is it I have no

150
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
idea of knowing what's going to happen

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,120
in the future when you get right down to

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,889
it it is possible would it not be

153
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,110
possible for me to get in to start a

154
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,870
sample size that trade 1 and end up

155
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,159
where every single one of them was a

156
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:43,710
loser am I going to know that in advance

157
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,819
and see and that's where paper trading

158
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,370
is so critical is that by paper trading

159
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,460
you will get a realistic assessment as

160
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,919
to how well your edge works and people

161
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,839
have no problem paper trading don't

162
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,270
paper trade to find out if you know if

163
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,169
they're meant that they can you know

164
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,789
they can their methodology works and to

165
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,529
gain confidence in it it's the other

166
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:06,669
part that they won't they won't

167
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,649
participate in meaning that they won't

168
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,180
take that same take

169
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,360
take a similar exercise to see how well

170
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,600
their own psychology matches up to what

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,860
they need to do to be consistently

172
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,470
successful in other words to set up an

173
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,210
exercise paper training is an exercise

174
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,729
is it not it's an exercise in developing

175
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,039
skills and understanding your

176
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,970
methodology is it not so wouldn't it be

177
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,649
just as reasonable to set up an exercise

178
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,779
to learn how to execute properly so

179
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,849
you've managed your expectations what

180
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,669
what do you consider a proper sample

181
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,029
size 20 25 trades I don't think it has

182
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,620
to be more than that I really don't if

183
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,720
it's not working within 25 trades and do

184
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,040
this then there's something there's

185
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
something you have to change okay so

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,029
it's all about our expectations when I

187
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,390
put money into a slot machine I'm

188
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,300
expecting something to happen if it

189
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,740
comes up a loser do I get all worked up

190
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,500
about this this tapped me into my

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,810
accumulated emotional pain of every time

192
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,820
I've been wrong and lost in my life I

193
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,790
mean look at there there are there are

194
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,279
people who trade and and and and because

195
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,709
of their expectations make every error

196
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,450
in the book and can't make consistent

197
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,770
money and the reason why is because of

198
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,730
the regs like I said because their

199
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,620
expectations and yet if they put money

200
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,690
into a slot machine where essentially

201
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,640
the only difference between technical

202
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,930
trading and a slot machine is the fact

203
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,670
that with a slot machine you have to put

204
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,950
your money in first and then wait for a

205
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,860
pattern to emerge with technical trading

206
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,839
you have to wait for a pattern to emerge

207
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,730
and then technically put your money on

208
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,190
the line the problem is because the way

209
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,320
our minds think we think that because

210
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,360
the pattern emerged that somehow or

211
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,089
another it's giving us an edge on that

212
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,930
particular individual trade and there's

213
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,760
just no way of knowing that but over a

214
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,060
series of trades it does so it's like

215
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,660
technical analysis gives the individual

216
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,620
the the availability of being the casino

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,570
Finkle analysis lets you own the slot

218
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,210
machine because you've got the odds in

219
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,720
your favor the casino makes the slot

220
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,450
machine available to us because they've

221
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,230
got the odds in their favor but - but

222
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,330
derive the benefit of those odds you

223
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,220
have to be able to execute properly and

224
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,170
you have to think about this properly it

225
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,450
is just a numbers game based on the odds

226
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,730
that means that you can't put an

227
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,430
extraordinary a and it let's say next

228
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,320
and it's an extraordinary amount of

229
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,360
significance on each individual trade

230
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,480
because if you sat and played a slot

231
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,710
machine you wouldn't think anything of

232
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,110
it if you if you put you played a dollar

233
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,700
slot machine and you sat down with the

234
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,380
idea that you know what I got a hundred

235
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,810
bucks in my pocket

236
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,450
and you didn't win you know you might

237
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,250
have you know is it ten times in a row

238
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,810
you didn't win you're still you're still

239
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,630
gonna push the button because eventually

240
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,920
you think eventually I'm gonna hit

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,080
eventually I'm gonna hit so it's alright

242
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,980
you see it's alright same thing here

243
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,170
this trade didn't work well eventually

244
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,400
eventually I'll get a winner

245
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,110
this trade didn't work eventually I get

246
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,700
a winner this trade didn't work well

247
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,520
eventually I'll get a winner no I don't

248
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,650
know about this next one now that's

249
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,800
almost always the winner now if it turns

250
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,900
out that your methodology has diminished

251
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,570
and it's let's say in its capacity to

252
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,820
produce a winning percentage because the

253
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,170
underlying nature of the market is

254
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,670
changing in relationship to this fixed

255
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,950
formula then you know that's why you

256
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,660
trade in smaller sample sizes or a

257
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,980
sample size where you don't lose an

258
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,270
inordinate amount of money to find out

259
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,550
it's not working but you do this right

260
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,370
and you're the casino regardless of all

261
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,930
the dynamic traders regardless of all

262
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,190
this other stuff I'm talking about it

263
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,630
doesn't matter none of that stuff's

264
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,900
important as long as you understand the

265
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,430
underslung as you understand how the

266
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,959
underlying dynamics relates to the

267
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,779
formula so that you don't put and you

268
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,920
know an extraordinary amount of

269
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,660
significance on a formula that's just

270
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,820
giving you a pattern in collective

271
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,680
behavior not individual behavior and

272
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,050
it's individuals who move the market so

273
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,180
those individuals there can always

274
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,290
an individual or group of individuals

275
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,120
who come into the market that do

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,070
something that completely negates the

277
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,720
outcome of your pattern and that's

278
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,160
alright because there's no way to know

279
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,110
that in advance

280
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,530
it's alright when you look at it that

281
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,300
way then you won't get all worked up

282
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,250
then it's just a random outcome just

283
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,230
like a slot machine it's just a random

284
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:03,460
outcome because that's what you're

285
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
expecting you expect a random outcome

286
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,710
you've got a random outcome and there's

287
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:16,570
no emotional significance because here's

288
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,430
what happens when you don't look at it

289
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:31,020
this way let's take a typical trader

290
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,400
who's operating out of the for Fears

291
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,660
okay we got support we got resistance we

292
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,880
got a nice training range the markets

293
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,449
coming down to support okay now a

294
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:54,800
typical trader operating out of those

295
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,329
four fears the fear of being wrong the

296
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,220
fear of losing money missing out you

297
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,810
know depending on the intensity of these

298
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,009
fears and they give it a moment he might

299
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,240
have a hard time putting that trade on

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,399
right he's got a Bible pattern you know

301
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,079
all that happened here is that when the

302
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,149
market got an imbalance in conviction

303
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,829
remember all price movements a result of

304
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:15,019
an imbalance in conviction the markets

305
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,060
came down to this point right here there

306
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,250
wasn't one person in the world not one

307
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,829
now let's say that's not one person in

308
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,940
the world in the whole world that would

309
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,389
offer that would take out the bids to

310
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,759
offer this market one tick lower than

311
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,329
this price right here not one okay and

312
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,380
then all of a sudden there's an

313
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,630
imbalance in conviction where there are

314
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,040
more buy orders and sell orders it

315
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,360
drives the price up to here and the same

316
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,190
thing happens driving the price down to

317
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,199
here same thing happens here here now

318
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,430
it's coming back down that from my

319
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,029
perspective I'm looking at it like this

320
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,680
how much room do I have to give the

321
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,980
market to tell me that the people who

322
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,899
bought here and the people who bought

323
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,459
here are going to come back into the

324
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,399
market and do it again because right now

325
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,230
there's an imbalance and conviction on

326
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,510
the sell side that means that enough

327
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,190
orders buy orders have to come into the

328
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,560
market to absorb all the offers to

329
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
absorb all those offers with enough left

330
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,490
over to create upside movement do I have

331
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,690
any way of knowing whether or not

332
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,230
they're going to come in no I know but

333
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,500
the odds are in my favor at least I hope

334
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,160
they are in any case I'm willing to risk

335
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,649
a certain amount of distance from my

336
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,350
entry point to find out that's all of it

337
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,870
that's all it means to me if they don't

338
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,459
come in it means you know what the guys

339
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,019
that were bought here but it might be

340
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,779
out to lunch and that happens I am not

341
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,709
kidding you I know that for a fact I've

342
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,760
experienced it because I intimately knew

343
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,250
you know a lot of the big traders in

344
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,870
certain markets that would buy

345
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,970
by here and I'm thinking okay they're

346
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,080
coming back in and they were out to

347
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:10,910
lunch so hey where were you guys but to

348
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,410
the typical trader that doesn't think

349
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,130
this way what's going to happen if he

350
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,070
manages to get the trade on it's gonna

351
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,860
be because he thinks he's right because

352
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,300
he thinks he knows what's going to

353
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,010
happen next right and he's not gonna put

354
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,750
in a stop because to predefine his risk

355
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,340
how much money does they have to how

356
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,530
much room and dollar-wise how much room

357
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,390
a distance of the dollar value of this

358
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,980
distance that it has to give the market

359
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,210
and tell him that this trade is either

360
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,720
working or it's not or that to let it go

361
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,070
any further is it worth finding out

362
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,020
that's all it means to me but he's not

363
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,180
gonna think that way he's gonna think by

364
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,800
gathering evidence that this trade might

365
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
not work he might be talking himself out

366
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,490
of taking it and so by the time he

367
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,410
actually manages to get this get this

368
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,690
order in the market and buy somewhere in

369
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,140
here

370
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,820
he has convinced himself that he's right

371
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,890
now I remember I said earlier and I

372
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,240
think I just said it once so you might

373
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,349
not have gotten it that fear has an has

374
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,730
an effect on the way we perceive

375
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,359
information when we're in a state of

376
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,670
mind of fear we are perceiving

377
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,040
information in a threatening way in

378
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,040
other words we're having an expectation

379
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,670
of pain remember I said that to

380
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,350
experience emotional pain there's two

381
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,610
kinds of pain physical pain and

382
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,160
emotional pain emotional pain requires

383
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,990
an interpretation the up and down ticks

384
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,540
that the market offers us are not

385
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,270
inherently pleasurable or painful by

386
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,190
their nature there is such a thing as

387
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,420
painful information

388
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,040
I mean painful from the environments

389
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,990
perspective if the environment if

390
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,640
someone is someone's hurling insults at

391
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,010
you their intent is to cause you

392
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,280
emotional pain but that doesn't mean

393
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,720
you're going to experience the emotional

394
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,600
pain unless you interpret it that way if

395
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,460
they're hurling insults at you and a

396
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,720
foreign language you don't have the

397
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,070
slightest idea about what they're saying

398
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,320
you may look to you like they're saying

399
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,790
something isn't so nice but then again

400
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,110
you don't have you don't know what the

401
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,630
words are and so what do you feel

402
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:26,390
nothing the interpretations come from

403
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,120
our beliefs the interpretations come

404
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,040
from our mental framework in other words

405
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,470
the pains already inside of us all the

406
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,120
words are doing is tapping us into it

407
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,620
once we learn how to manage our

408
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,690
interpretations we can manage the way

409
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,610
that we feel we can actually determine

410
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,140
how we feel in our own state of mind so

411
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,540
this trader he's operating out of a fear

412
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,350
of being wrong

413
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,530
so like I said he convinces himself that

414
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,540
he's right that's the way you get the

415
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,480
trade on so let's say the market

416
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,519
now I said that fear causes us to focus

417
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,739
on their focus on the object of our fear

418
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,720
so that we end up creating the very

419
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,600
experience we're trying to avoid this

420
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,850
trader is trying to avoid being wrong

421
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,629
now we have self protective mechanisms

422
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:37,129
there they can work at an unconscious

423
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,919
level there are mechanisms inside of us

424
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,269
that will protect us from information

425
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,809
that we perceive as threatening it

426
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,879
causes what was typically referred to as

427
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:49,340
perceptual blindness where there are

428
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,109
things going on around us that we cannot

429
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,059
perceive even though we have the ability

430
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,129
to perceive it but we're being blinded

431
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,249
from it if I'm afraid of being wrong

432
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,889
what of the information that the market

433
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,349
is making available to me what am I

434
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,999
going to focus my attention on the up

435
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:09,649
ticks of the down ticks you're right the

436
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:13,009
up ticks not the down ticks meaning that

437
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,619
what I will do is I will place an

438
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,749
inordinate amount of significance and

439
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,849
although the way my mind will

440
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,830
automatically weigh this information in

441
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,149
terms of what's significant and what

442
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,269
isn't it will give more significance to

443
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,700
the up ticks than the down ticks because

444
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,649
every time I get an uptick it will be

445
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,200
taking me out of my pain I'll say oh

446
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,549
it's finally all over and then we'll get

447
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:39,259
more down ticks and then we get a couple

448
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,149
up ticks and say oh it's finally all

449
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:43,309
over in other words what my mind is

450
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,710
doing to protect me is saying that these

451
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,320
few up ticks are far more significant

452
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,639
than all these down ticks now do I have

453
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,279
the ability to recognize a trend in

454
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,769
other words being able to define and

455
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,179
recognize the trend is one of the most

456
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,609
fundamental characteristics of learning

457
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,830
technical analysis a trend is a high

458
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,179
series of higher highs and higher lows

459
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:08,269
or lower highs and lower lows but in

460
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,039
this moment a might be able to recognize

461
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,679
this as a trend no because I'm too

462
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,749
focused on getting myself out of the

463
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,549
pain which means that I'm focused on

464
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:20,690
these up ticks now our trader is

465
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,889
operating both out of a fear of being

466
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,999
wrong and a fear of losing money now

467
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,950
what ends up happening is this is that

468
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,840
if this if this word

469
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
present all the negative energy inside

470
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,150
of his mind of what it means to be wrong

471
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,220
there's also negative energy inside of

472
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,059
his mind about what it means to lose and

473
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,980
as the market was further and further

474
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,440
against his position his belief about

475
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,630
losing will start to gain more and more

476
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,440
significance and start to rise to the

477
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,909
forefront of his consciousness and make

478
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,600
itself known make its presence known

479
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,549
until finally he gets to a point where

480
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,740
he cannot stand losing one more dollar

481
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,210
and that one more dollar in essence is

482
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,789
when the pain of losing one more dollar

483
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,990
is one degree greater than the pain of

484
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,090
admitting that he's wrong in other words

485
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,740
when this pain is greater than that

486
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,490
pained by one degree he'll get out of

487
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,549
the trade that's when he'll admit that

488
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,690
it's a losing trade and get out you guys

489
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,230
with me on this

490
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,620
now he would say that the market did

491
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,610
this to him but what I'm saying is that

492
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,860
is blatantly not the case his fear did

493
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,960
that to him he created the very

494
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,910
experience he was trying to avoid he was

495
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,650
trying to avoid being wrong and he made

496
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,020
himself wrong and ultimately this was

497
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,580
always a spot with the market you know

498
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,650
where the market does that anyway you

499
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,930
guys with me on this okay now this

500
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,310
trader gets out of this trade right here

501
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,070
he looks back at this chart pattern and

502
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,980
he why did I just go short why didn't I

503
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:34,780
just go short the ability to recognize

504
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,130
this as a downtrend

505
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,350
let's say he was blinded from his

506
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,380
ability to recognize us as a downtrend

507
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,120
the distinction existed inside of his

508
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,610
mind in other words he can actually make

509
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,640
the distinction of what a downtrend is

510
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,990
but in that moment while he was in that

511
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,060
trade he was blinded to his own

512
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:59,920
distinctions because he was operating

513
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,250
out of a trade by trade mentality he was

514
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,170
operating I would say he was operating

515
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,330
out of a trade by trade mentality this

516
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,010
trade took on the significance of life

517
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,790
or death

518
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,800
just like any any other trade that he

519
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,460
puts on does and to be a consistently

520
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,650
successful trader it ain't gonna happen

521
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,530
if you think that way the pros don't

522
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,780
think that way determine your risk

523
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,850
either works or it doesn't and win go to

524
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,220
the next trade determine your risk the

525
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,510
work sort of doesn't go to the next

526
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,150
trade that that's all it is that's the

527
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,450
whole game

528
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,809
now let's say that this doesn't happen

529
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,570
but this happens but say instead of it

530
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,250
going against them at the market does

531
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,290
this now what ticks do you think he's

532
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,670
gonna be focused on the upper the down

533
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,140
ticks the mark is doing exactly what he

534
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,480
wants by the way now the market is doing

535
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,420
exactly what he wants and what ticks do

536
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,640
you think he's gonna be focused on out

537
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,059
of down ticks and why the down ticks

538
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,679
because he's been in too many times the

539
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,150
trades in the market has taken away his

540
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,240
profits and so he plays an inordinate

541
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,340
amount of significance on every down

542
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,150
tick and in essence ends up doing what

543
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,970
leaving money on the table so what he

544
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,610
does is let's say he gets out right here

545
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,770
so he cuts his profit shorts and lets

546
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:41,110
his losses run in Chicago vernacular

547
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,660
this is called like this is called

548
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,740
shooting like an elephant and eating

549
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,160
like a bird

550
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:08,590
I hope that now if this trader had a

551
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,919
belief in a random outcome that he

552
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,029
didn't have to know what was going to

553
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:18,429
happen next to make money what do you

554
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,429
have these problems what would he be

555
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:23,110
expecting if he had a belief in a random

556
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,429
outcome that there was just a random

557
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,440
distribution between wins and losses and

558
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,970
then he give him a set of variables that

559
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,350
define his edge if he believed that if

560
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,789
he believed that only took one trader

561
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,049
somewhere in the world to negate the

562
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,990
positive outcome of his edge if you

563
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,760
believe that no matter what reason he

564
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,649
thinks he has for putting on that trade

565
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:42,940
that the reason why it works or it

566
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,679
doesn't work will almost never correlate

567
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,450
to the actual reason that he conjured up

568
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,840
if he believed all these things how

569
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,130
would he be handling this come on how

570
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:02,639
would he be handling it tell me okay

571
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,820
when he got into the trade he's going to

572
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,669
say that okay when it reaches this level

573
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,760
right here I'm gonna get out if it goes

574
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,220
down to this level down here I'm gonna

575
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,769
get out now he may have ended up leaving

576
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,659
some money on the table but at least

577
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:22,330
he's going to be in that percentage that

578
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,360
he had already predetermined it's going

579
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,419
to create him to be a winning percentage

580
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,730
of trades would he have the same be

581
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,799
saddled with the same emotional problems

582
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,470
that he had if he if he was operating

583
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,789
out of a fear of being wrong or losing

584
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,340
money no no because you didn't have any

585
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,080
emotion in the trade it's saying hey

586
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
it's following my predetermined plan

587
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,179
that I have in place and it either works

588
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,980
or doesn't right that's right because I

589
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,389
trade from a series of trades

590
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:50,950
perspective I don't know what each

591
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,210
individual trade is going to do

592
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,419
this is the way the pros do it by the

593
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,119
way this is thinking like a pro you want

594
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,289
to make consistent money this is what

595
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:08,369
you gonna have to think otherwise you

596
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,539
already know what the problems are

597
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,039
trading will take on a take on a quality

598
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,350
of being

599
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,730
exasperated because you can see the

600
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,019
potential and it seems like you're

601
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:24,090
always just that just like that close

602
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,429
I'm getting it and you never get there

603
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:28,769
how we feel our state of mind in any

604
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,379
given situation is always real and the

605
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:34,350
absolute truth now I want you to make a

606
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,299
distinction here and any given moment

607
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:40,110
we're in a state of mind state of mind

608
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,490
could be any number of things we have a

609
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,190
lot of ways to define states of mind we

610
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,509
could be a state of mind of like sits

611
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:50,399
satisfaction dissatisfaction happiness

612
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:57,419
joy fear terror these are all states of

613
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,639
mind confidence in the state of mind as

614
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,529
a state of mind confidence when I'm

615
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,279
confident I feel I feel compelled to

616
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,350
step into a situation compels to thrust

617
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,919
me forward into an experience of course

618
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,779
if I'm fearful then what am i doing I'm

619
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,610
pulling back because I feel threatened

620
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,950
in some way I'm perceiving the

621
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,019
information that's available in that

622
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,570
moment as threatening but you've got to

623
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,980
remember for me to perceive it that way

624
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,850
it means I'm interpreting it that way

625
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,470
here's where people get real mixed up

626
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,350
about this sort of thing is that the

627
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,749
state of mind that we experience in any

628
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:38,369
given moment as always the absolute

629
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,070
truth you can't deny the fact if I'm if

630
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm feeling fearful right now that I'm

631
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,580
that I'm feeling fearful that's just the

632
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,110
way that it is I'm in that state of mind

633
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,789
the particular interpretation that got

634
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,980
me into that state of mind however could

635
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,889
be completely dysfunctional the guys

636
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:01,619
with me on this the interpretation that

637
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:03,779
comes from what we believe could be

638
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,369
completely dysfunctional

639
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,929
you see as passive technical traders if

640
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:17,790
we believe that somehow or another our

641
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,530
methodology is telling us what's going

642
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,460
to happen next

643
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,799
on any particular trade the reason why

644
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,140
we're having problems is because that is

645
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,510
a dysfunctional belief it was never true

646
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,710
now the states of mind that result from

647
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,830
that belief are real so for an example

648
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,590
if I put on a trade and it turns out to

649
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,390
be a winner I think that I'm right

650
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,960
and as a result I feel great if I put on

651
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,000
a trade and I think that I lose well

652
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,880
then I feel like crap because I was

653
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,910
wrong the reality is neither one was

654
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,860
really true because when you win you

655
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,170
weren't right and when you're wrong you

656
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,830
weren't wrong because whatever reason

657
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,030
you had to put on the trade in the first

658
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,670
place again had almost no correlation to

659
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,980
what actually happened with the market

660
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,300
in other words why the market did what

661
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,820
it did you just happen to put on a trade

662
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,710
at that time that worked and all

663
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,650
technical patterns do technical

664
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,870
indicators I mean pen price patterns is

665
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,940
get you into a situation where there's a

666
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,090
likelihood a likelihood a likelihood

667
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,240
that when you get into that trade it'll

668
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,240
work that's all they were ever

669
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,820
represented to be understand I'm saying

670
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,860
that's all they were ever represented to

671
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,170
be I'm not saying they don't get you

672
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,450
know screwed up somehow in terms of the

673
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,770
way people represent them but that's

674
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,110
basically that's all basically they ever

675
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:06,100
they ever were it's not on a trade by

676
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,790
trade basis now we're gonna get into the

677
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,950
last part of it we're we're heading down

678
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,290
the homestretch guys heading down to the

679
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,680
homestretch

680
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,740
are we all right up to this point as far

681
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,300
as anybody have any questions about the

682
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,980
fear and confidence and the

683
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,680
relationships that we're talking about

684
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,730
that what we're talking about is the

685
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,560
fact that we've got it if we want to we

686
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,630
want to think like a pro so that we can

687
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,980
experience the kind of results that the

688
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,020
pros get which are consistent it means

689
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,640
that we have to change our perspective

690
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,500
from trade by trade to a series of

691
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,030
trades does anybody have any questions

692
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,300
about that and why that's essential so

693
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,160
if you know that why do we have to go to

694
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,530
a series of trades perspective why

695
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
well hold on one second sir

696
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,290
you're taking all the fear out of and

697
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,840
you know that through a series you'll be

698
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,280
right more the times and you will be

699
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,620
wrong and you take all the fear out of

700
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,050
it and just work on that basis without

701
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,050
any emotion correct no and why isn't

702
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,730
there any emotion when you take give me

703
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,140
specifically why you think there's no

704
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,210
emotion well you're doing it out more of

705
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,850
a mathematical concept and not I think

706
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,560
it's gonna do this you're taking to see

707
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
they're gonna be right or it's gonna be

708
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,500
wrong and you either walk away or stay

709
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,030
in it I want you to use words

710
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,530
expectations and your in your answer

711
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,910
okay I don't have any expectations it's

712
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,770
either gonna work or it's not yeah

713
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,180
another words this particular trade you

714
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,320
don't know what you think something's

715
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,370
gonna happen but you don't know what

716
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,140
when you when you put money a slot

717
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,550
machine and push the button you think

718
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,840
something's gonna happen but you don't

719
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,700
know what and if it comes out to be the

720
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,410
putt jackpot well hey your dad feels

721
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,630
great you're surprised right when I put

722
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,000
on a trade I feel the same way literally

723
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,710
I don't know I don't have to know I just

724
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,270
have to do what I need to do to make

725
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,370
money I can on a consistent basis which

726
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,570
means I have to take every one of these

727
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,930
trades I can't pick and choose the only

728
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,040
reason why I'd pick and choose is

729
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,130
because I think I'm right so when you

730
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,840
change your perspective from a trade by

731
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,060
trade to a series of trades it

732
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,400
automatically manages your expectations

733
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,920
in a positive way I'm gonna set this up

734
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,300
for you as an exercise in a little bit

735
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,340
okay but but I just want to make sure

736
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,889
where anybody else have any questions

737
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,010
about any of this so you know you so in

738
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,320
other words what so what we're doing at

739
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,370
this what are we doing at this point

740
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,960
down so so you know where you want to go

741
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,330
right so do we know where we want to go

742
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,520
we want to get to a point where we are

743
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,270
actually changing the way that we think

744
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,590
when you walked in here this morning you

745
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,409
didn't think like a pro did you now you

746
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,389
have some idea of what it means to think

747
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,480
like a pro right come on yes or no come

748
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,500
on guys give me some response okay how

749
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,610
we gonna get there now we might

750
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,760
understand it how we gonna get there

751
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,720
well

752
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,460
paper trading yeah well yeah sort of but

753
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,840
yeah I didn't you know I'm not saying

754
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,369
you just have the answer and I say we

755
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:09,510
got to have a way to get there right we

756
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,920
have to but we have to have a series of

757
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,630
steps to be able to get to this

758
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,950
particular mindset because what we're

759
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,660
really talking about here is we're

760
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,550
talking about changing the way that we

761
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,970
think now that can have some profound

762
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,790
implications right no one seems to like

763
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:30,390
to change the way that they think most

764
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,950
traders have to go through the process

765
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,590
remember this morning the thread that

766
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,210
the common thread between all traders

767
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,300
who end up you know being you know being

768
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,890
really successful is that they end up

769
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,840
having to lose one or more fortunes of

770
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,880
what they defined as a fortune to get to

771
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,760
that point it's because the process of

772
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,940
losing caused them to change the way

773
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,290
that they think about trading now do you

774
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,880
want to do this the hard way or do you

775
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,970
want to do it the easy way okay I'm

776
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,010
getting some response here good the easy

777
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,020
way right we want to do it the easy way

778
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,660
so this is what this is all about now

779
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,859
this is what the last part of the

780
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,050
workshop is about is about doing it the

781
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,500
easy way what's that right there you go

782
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,690
how do we change well that's a good

783
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,420
question right that's a real good one

784
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,080
how do we change a lot of theories a lot

785
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,550
of techniques about a lot of theories a

786
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,040
lot of theories on techniques as far as

787
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm concerned change is really a

788
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,690
function of well you can break down to a

789
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,040
series of steps and really change is

790
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,710
really a function of desire when you get

791
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,359
right down remember how we took price

792
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,280
movement and boiled it down and

793
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,130
distilled it down to simply what price

794
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,510
movement all price movement is a

795
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,420
function of what imbalance and

796
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,530
conviction between buyers and sellers

797
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:02,060
all change is a function of desire

798
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,870
if the desire is there you'll find a way

799
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,060
to facilitate the change and it really

800
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,440
doesn't matter what the technique is

801
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:22,690
honest to god it really doesn't I'll

802
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,520
give you an example right here probably

803
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,050
the one of the most extreme examples I

804
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,010
could come up with you could by the way

805
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,210
this what I'm gonna read you right now I

806
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,230
got off a guy who and you can go google

807
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,330
this kid and find out more about him

808
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,540
yourself okay but as I read this to you

809
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,930
keep in mind how this kid accomplished

810
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,400
this because the scientists that that

811
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,560
investigate this they don't know they

812
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,420
can't figure it out to me it's easy the

813
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,030
kids desire was so intense that he

814
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:03,160
managed to find a way this is Lincoln

815
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,820
Nebraska

816
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,430
Bryce Mellon is a whiz at video games

817
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,710
such as Mortal Kombat who is anybody

818
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,330
familiar Mortal Kombat I'm not into

819
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,250
video games though well not those video

820
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,260
games anyway Mortal Kombat okay I've got

821
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,320
some people this is a tough game yeah

822
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,190
challenging okay in that regard the 17

823
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,300
year old and he's a little older now

824
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,650
this was a couple years ago in that

825
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,320
regard the 17 year old isn't much

826
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,340
different from so many others his age

827
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,620
except for one thing

828
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:42,130
he's blind and as Eve and as he easily

829
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,160
dispatched foes who took him on recently

830
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,410
at a Lincoln gaming center the affable

831
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,180
and smiling bright smiling Bryce

832
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,210
remained humble I can't say that I'm a

833
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,010
superhero we said working the controller

834
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,680
like an extension of his body I can be

835
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,550
beat those bold enough to challenge him

836
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,590
weren't so lucky one by one while

837
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,570
playing Soul Calibur - which is another

838
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,370
game their video characters were

839
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,860
decapitated eviscerated and without

840
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,410
mercy bye-bye Bryce's on-screen

841
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,560
alter-ego I'm getting bored Bryce said

842
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,010
and just as he won game after game blind

843
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,350
since birth

844
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,730
when his optic nerve didn't connect

845
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,370
because of LIBOR disease Brice honed his

846
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,810
video skills over the years through

847
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,360
patient and not so patient playing

848
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,100
memorizing key joystick operations and

849
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,020
moves in certain games while asking lots

850
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,730
of questions paying particular attention

851
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,250
to audio cues he worked his way up from

852
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,020
games such as space invaders and

853
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,890
asteroids into modern combat games I

854
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,450
guess I don't know how I do it really

855
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,580
Bryce said as he continued playing while

856
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,950
facing away from the screen facing away

857
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,760
from the screen it's beyond me that's

858
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,150
what I'm just quoting him Bryce knows

859
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,710
this much he started playing at home and

860
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,540
he was about seven he enjoyed playing he

861
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,980
enjoyed trying to play but he wasn't

862
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,990
very good at first said his father Larry

863
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,270
but he just kept trying he broke a lot

864
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,160
of controllers when the questions of

865
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,990
broken controllers comes up Bryce

866
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,700
flashes a smile in just shrugs I used to

867
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,230
have quite a temporary said me and

868
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,670
controllers didn't get along very well

869
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,260
now they're just now we get along just

870
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,710
fine

871
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,810
while playing Soul Calibur - Bryce

872
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,700
worked his way through the introductory

873
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,860
screens with ease knowing exactly what

874
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,870
to click to start the game he wanted he

875
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,580
rarely asked for help once the game

876
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,470
started he didn't need any help how do I

877
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,710
move an exasperated ponent Ryan O'Banion

878
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,720
asked while doing battle which his

879
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,850
character was frozen in place you can't

880
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,380
Bryce answered before finishing him off

881
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,390
that's what happens it's why I don't

882
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,400
play him O'Banion's said after his blood

883
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,020
spattered character's corpse vanishes

884
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,780
from the screen now Bryce became so how

885
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,400
Bryce became so good as a mystery to his

886
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,260
father he just sat there and he tried

887
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,270
and tried until he got it right Larry

888
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,760
melon said he can't ever complain to me

889
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,170
or anyone else about how hard it was

890
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,720
Bryce hangs out any chance he gets at

891
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,060
the dogtags gaming center in Lincoln

892
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,190
opened last month every now and then

893
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,510
someone will come in and think that he

894
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,860
can't that he that he can beat the bot

895
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,510
that he that he can beat the blanket

896
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,270
that attitude doesn't faze Brian I'm

897
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,430
challenge I challenge I'll challenge

898
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,320
them maybe if I feel like a challenge

899
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,390
you said displaying and Infectious

900
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,820
confidence i freak people out by playing

901
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,260
by playing facing backwards there's

902
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,060
nothing like there's nothing he likes

903
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,010
better than playing video games he would

904
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,240
be a senior in high school next year

905
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,010
after graduation he plans a year off

906
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,290
because he wants a break from school

907
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,090
and when he goes to college he wants to

908
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,950
study what else in video game design

909
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,290
this is just an extreme example but I

910
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,950
think a really good one that all change

911
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,680
is a function of desire if you want it

912
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,530
bad enough you'll find a way to do it if

913
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,700
you want to be able to think of

914
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,080
probabilities because you want to be

915
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,660
consistently successful you will find a

916
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,300
way to do it I'm going to give you ways

917
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,760
but what I'm saying is that you will

918
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,300
find a way if you don't then it's that

919
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,060
simple you won't it's like almost every

920
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,790
what might the traders when I was doing

921
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,140
coaching the traders that I worked with

922
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,300
fell into the two basic categories and

923
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,510
there almost wasn't anybody in between

924
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,330
the first category would be traders who

925
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,360
are already consistently successful they

926
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,550
already knew how to win and what they

927
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,520
wanted was fine tuning so they'd go to a

928
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,800
trading coach like myself to find ways

929
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,780
to find some really creative ways let's

930
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,000
say to fine tune fine-tune themselves

931
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,380
where they can actually make more money

932
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,250
than what they were already making and

933
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,580
then the other category was desperation

934
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,520
and I'll do anything

935
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,930
they all do anything the everyone in

936
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:57,790
between no way and even they all do

937
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,640
anything wasn't always sincere sometimes

938
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,300
it was just lip service

939
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,819
change is also a function of the degree

940
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,680
to which we change is also a function of

941
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,160
the clarity of your intent in other

942
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,869
words you could have the desire but your

943
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,270
intent has to be really clear because

944
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,220
when you think about the whole concept

945
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,319
of changing which are really saying is

946
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,510
that I'm willing to let go of a certain

947
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,799
portion of my identity in a way of some

948
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:38,420
part of myself that you know I obviously

949
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,309
operate it out up for X number of years

950
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:43,500
or months or whatever put it maybe put a

951
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,670
lot of energy into and you got to be

952
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,710
willing to let that go is it even

953
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,619
possible to change a belief how about it

954
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,349
is it possible to change a belief I mean

955
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,730
it happens all the time does it not is

956
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,559
there anybody in the room who did not

957
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,390
grow up by this is this is just a simple

958
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,130
example a simple illustration is there

959
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,420
anybody in the room who did not grow up

960
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,140
with it with a belief in Santa Claus

961
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,490
that most everybody did just an example

962
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,740
if you believed at some point in your

963
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,369
life in Santa Claus where's that belief

964
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:21,359
now what happened to it what happened to

965
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,190
that portion of your identity because if

966
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,750
we are all children if we're all four

967
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,569
and five years old and someone knocked

968
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,549
on that door and said Santa Claus is out

969
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:31,470
in the lobby we'd probably be jumping

970
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,789
over each other to get over there to get

971
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,910
there right and it was that belief the

972
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,890
energy inside of that belief would

973
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,260
compel us to express ourselves in a

974
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,130
particular way

975
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,049
a way that was consistent with the

976
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:46,260
belief if I believed in Santa Claus and

977
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,210
someone said and gave me information

978
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,190
said Santa Clauses in the lobby I'm

979
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,619
gonna be I'm gonna be jumping over these

980
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,960
tables to get there as a four-year-old

981
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,450
now as an adult someone knocked on the

982
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,710
door and said Santa Claus in the lobby

983
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,849
I'm sure I just took just ignore me

984
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,170
where did the my belief in Santa Claus

985
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,910
go what happened to it

986
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,920
yeah I don't know the underlie mean

987
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,360
really I don't I can't say that I know

988
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,860
the underlying dynamics of how that

989
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,400
energy got transformed but I can say it

990
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,830
doesn't exist inside of my mental

991
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,350
environment any longer in a way that

992
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,030
would compel me to express myself like I

993
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,130
did believe in Santa Claus and noble

994
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,050
words there's no more energy there I can

995
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,850
remember when I did believe it I could

996
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,590
say to myself oh yeah there was you know

997
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,540
there was something there's something or

998
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,530
maybe there's something there even now

999
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,630
but not enough to say not enough for me

1000
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:48,300
to go running out into the lobby you can

1001
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,520
say before you walked in here that you

1002
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,020
might have had a real strong belief that

1003
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,000
whatever you use to determine your edge

1004
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,340
gave you that edge on a trade by trade

1005
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,990
basis in other words I wouldn't be

1006
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,220
putting on this trade if I didn't think

1007
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,960
I was right now you can say to yourself

1008
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,500
are you willing to let that go the only

1009
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,610
way you're going to be willing to let it

1010
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,700
go to even generate the desire to let it

1011
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,520
go is if you're really clear about your

1012
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,300
intent hopefully I've given you enough

1013
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,000
insight to be really clear about your

1014
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,430
intent as to why you might want to let

1015
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,810
this go because it's just going to

1016
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,690
create frustration if you like trading

1017
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,850
on a random basis then great then stay

1018
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,730
on a trade by trade basis then trade

1019
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,620
randomly because it is fun you'll win

1020
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,690
you'll have winning streaks but I can

1021
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,970
assure you I can't assure you without a

1022
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,550
shadow of a doubt that you trade

1023
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,490
randomly and you are setting yourself up

1024
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,880
for catastrophic losses because anything

1025
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,610
you do could result in a win and most of

1026
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,830
the things people end up doing are just

1027
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,330
the kind of things that set themselves

1028
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,640
up for catastrophic loss because

1029
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,230
inappropriate you are reinforcing

1030
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,700
inappropriate behaviors on a train when

1031
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,350
you trade randomly on a trade by trade

1032
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,080
basis you are reinforcing inappropriate

1033
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,170
behaviors those inappropriate behaviors

1034
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,970
namely are not predefined in your risk

1035
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,220
is the biggest one you get into a trade

1036
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,960
you don't predefined your risk and you

1037
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,520
win you're going to do it again you're

1038
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,960
going to do it again until you get hit

1039
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,700
with it without with

1040
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:33,530
huge loss and sometimes those are really

1041
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,420
hard to recover from in fact for most

1042
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:41,420
people they're almost impossible not you

1043
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,130
can't it's just that you don't have the

1044
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,230
resources for nor do they have the the

1045
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,030
desire the inclination to do it they

1046
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:57,020
just walk away are you

1047
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,089
relatively clear about why you would

1048
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:01,609
want to do this why you'd want to go

1049
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:03,290
from a trade by trade to a series of

1050
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:15,500
trades perspective sincerity say you

1051
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,140
need to desire you need the clarity and

1052
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,589
you need the sincerity

1053
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:31,310
it can't be lip service it has to be

1054
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:37,970
real it has to be authentic as a matter

1055
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,910
of fact I'm going to say to you that

1056
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,730
based on my experience if you're clear

1057
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,910
if the desire is there its genuine the

1058
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,609
clarity of your purpose is there it son

1059
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:53,660
conflicted and so the sincerity is there

1060
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,730
it will virtually happen automatically

1061
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,950
that is the technique for change what

1062
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,560
most people the problem is is that with

1063
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,990
most people it takes pasta it takes

1064
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,359
usually a series let's say it takes

1065
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,210
using various techniques that are

1066
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,040
available that have been you know that

1067
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,140
have been created and thought up that

1068
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,170
over a period of years they finally get

1069
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,520
to the point where they're come they had

1070
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,069
the the real desire they have the

1071
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:27,560
clarity and the real sincerity is there

1072
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,359
and once all those are in place the

1073
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,040
change happens automatically and they

1074
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,240
would think that it happened over a

1075
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,579
period of years using techniques but the

1076
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:36,650
reality is it just clicked into that

1077
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,690
just finally the whole thing clicked

1078
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,270
into that that one point where it's all

1079
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,590
there like the cut that like the straw

1080
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:51,680
that broke the camel's back I mean a

1081
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,470
good example would be about what I'm

1082
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,660
talking about in terms of how clear you

1083
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,420
have to be in some cases because some of

1084
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,950
the energy that you want to move out in

1085
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,540
terms of a conflicting or dysfunctional

1086
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,310
belief it could be really strong energy

1087
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,380
I mean you know there could be pretty

1088
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,300
substantial when you think about it I

1089
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,500
mean there are traders that I worked

1090
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,480
with many years ago especially that

1091
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,450
we're really I mean hard hard-core

1092
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,890
technicians I mean these are really

1093
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,520
hardcore guys that just you know I'm not

1094
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,780
even gonna mention the techniques they

1095
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,250
use but you know it's like well I gave

1096
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,800
like Elliott Wave casualties I mean

1097
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,270
there were there were guys that were

1098
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:30,050
just you know there's a time in the in

1099
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,180
the late 80s and early 90s where a lot

1100
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,740
of my off the floor traders were what I

1101
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,350
call Elliott Wave casualties and you

1102
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,450
know because these are guys would just

1103
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,270
you know who love to analyze and you

1104
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,430
know when you start with it you start

1105
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,320
when they start understanding the

1106
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,180
difference between analysis and

1107
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,370
execution and also the underlying

1108
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,670
dynamics of the market it's like it's

1109
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,610
like they had to get to a point where

1110
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,470
the realization that they'd spent ten

1111
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,110
years or eight years and thousands or

1112
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,050
tens of thousands of dollars on analysis

1113
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,110
and workshops and seminars when I mean

1114
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,880
when none of it was there very little of

1115
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,320
it was really necessary I mean they had

1116
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,850
to get reconciled all that stuff and

1117
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,190
that wasn't an easy thing to do that was

1118
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,750
an easy thing to let go of it wasn't an

1119
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,610
easy thing to say okay it was alright

1120
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,230
you know though I know what I need to

1121
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:27,380
know now and you know but how do you

1122
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,410
know what real clarity of intent is

1123
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,880
imagine yourself being held underwater

1124
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,730
imagine yourself being held underwater

1125
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:43,250
and as your air starts to run out second

1126
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,460
by second it gets to the point where you

1127
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,610
believe that if you don't get a breath

1128
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,390
of air

1129
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:59,150
right now you're gonna drown that is a

1130
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,760
point at which every fiber of your

1131
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,250
mental being is aligned is aligned 100%

1132
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,460
with your desire for that next breath of

1133
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,770
air there's no conflict there's no

1134
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:19,000
hesitation there isn't anything that

1135
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,560
argues inside of you for anything else

1136
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:29,210
other than that next breath of air if

1137
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,150
you want to make money bad enough in

1138
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,880
other words if you want to be want to be

1139
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,590
able to make the kind of income that you

1140
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,500
can rely on as a trader then your desire

1141
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,480
to switch to this series of trades

1142
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,380
approach has to be greater than any

1143
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,100
resistance that you might have to stay

1144
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,910
in a trade by train approach does this

1145
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,150
make sense

1146
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:05,359
degree of conviction I just basically

1147
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,489
gave you that to the you know the how

1148
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:09,589
much energy is behind your desire energy

1149
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:11,509
moves prices in the market I mean what

1150
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,190
moves prices an imbalance in conviction

1151
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,019
what its conviction imply conviction

1152
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:19,309
implies energy energy I am NOT going to

1153
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,349
bid a price up to a next highest level

1154
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:24,619
unless I think I know what the hell I'm

1155
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:27,109
doing and that I can at the market I can

1156
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:28,489
make the market go further or someone

1157
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:29,660
else is going to come in and help me out

1158
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,180
I have to have conviction to do the

1159
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,029
opposite of what it takes to make money

1160
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:39,920
meaning by high instead of by low or

1161
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,549
sell low instead of sell high

1162
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:45,140
my conviction in the future has to be

1163
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,640
greater than the guy on the other side

1164
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,509
of the trade conviction moves prices

1165
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:55,430
conviction will move energy inside your

1166
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:58,059
mental environment

1167
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,640
focus thought will move energy out of

1168
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,289
dysfunction bullet dysfunctional beliefs

1169
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,339
and that's basically what we're talking

1170
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,720
about we're talking about clarity of

1171
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,099
intent desire that is focused thought

1172
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:17,420
you know exactly where you want to go

1173
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,789
you want to get to the point where you

1174
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,869
believe that there's a random

1175
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:22,309
distribution between wins and losses

1176
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,269
that anything can happen that you don't

1177
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:27,500
need to know what's going to happen next

1178
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,019
to make money and that's the big one I

1179
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:30,980
don't need to know what's going to

1180
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,890
happen next to make money if you

1181
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,430
understand the benefits of installing

1182
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:43,730
those beliefs inside your mental

1183
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,880
environment as a core component of your

1184
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,029
trading personality then you will find a

1185
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:58,059
way to do it I'm gonna give you away but

1186
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,029
self-discipline self-discipline I define

1187
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:09,890
as as simply making a conscious

1188
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,900
commitment to pay attention to what you

1189
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,400
are thinking saying or doing in

1190
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,019
relationship to what you're trying to

1191
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:17,210
accomplish in any given moment in other

1192
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:20,180
words if for an example I have a goal or

1193
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,640
a desire or an objective a desire to

1194
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,009
transform myself into someone who could

1195
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:27,230
think like a professional trader someone

1196
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,549
who thinks in a series of trades

1197
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:30,890
perspective someone who believes in the

1198
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,930
random distribution between wins and

1199
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,470
losses in my series and I and I also

1200
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,930
know that you know I I may have any

1201
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,029
number of conflicting beliefs that I've

1202
00:55:41,029 --> 00:55:42,319
acquired over the years that say

1203
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,900
otherwise but say you know even though

1204
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm aware of the benefits of this

1205
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,950
there's all these other beliefs that say

1206
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,829
this isn't true this is not who this is

1207
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:54,559
not who I am this is who I am right here

1208
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,750
this guy okay yeah he seems to be making

1209
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,069
a lot of sense up here but you know

1210
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:01,250
something this is who I am you want to

1211
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,809
transform yourself into someone who

1212
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:06,589
thinks this you can use self discipline

1213
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:09,019
as a technique which is simply my

1214
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:10,880
objective is a think in a series of

1215
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,400
trades perspective start monitoring your

1216
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,720
thoughts your words or your actions to

1217
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,220
see that they're consistent with

1218
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,840
what it is that you want to accomplish

1219
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,650
and then simply purposefully refocus

1220
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,940
when you find out that you're doing

1221
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,770
saying doing or thinking something

1222
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,200
that's opposite or not not consistent

1223
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,270
with what you desire and just constantly

1224
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,280
refocus eventually get to the point

1225
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,460
where you are that person a real good

1226
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,119
example of employing self discipline is

1227
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:45,500
back in the late 70s I decided I want to

1228
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,630
become a runner and I can't tell you why

1229
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,030
I could I don't remember the reason why

1230
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,369
I just got it my brain that I want to do

1231
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:54,980
it now back when I was a kid in high

1232
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,359
school in college I was very active

1233
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:59,420
played a lot of sports but in the you

1234
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,300
know from that point on my lifestyle was

1235
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,760
such that I ended up becoming somewhat

1236
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,970
of a slug and I say a slug just you know

1237
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,950
I watched a lot of my primary vocation

1238
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:12,910
of them working was watching TV and so

1239
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,590
when I decided that you know I wanted to

1240
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,599
become a runner you know what I do I

1241
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,550
went out and Rand could I found out that

1242
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,320
I couldn't I mean him I said couldn't

1243
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,570
and I literally couldn't I was shocked

1244
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,869
and astounded that's how hot a shape I

1245
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:30,770
was I couldn't run two blocks and so you

1246
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,900
know I went out the next day you really

1247
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,150
could run two blocks again oh my god and

1248
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,520
then I didn't run again for probably six

1249
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,540
months and so so when I ran again at

1250
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,800
least had enough enough desire to compel

1251
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,930
me to run more than a couple of days and

1252
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,480
and something in and I found something

1253
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,359
out is that is that I was amazed how

1254
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,490
fast I how fast your body adapts and

1255
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,140
improves and so that gave me a lot of

1256
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,880
encouragement because you know I ran a

1257
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,410
couple of times I ran the third and

1258
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,180
fourth time and it's like I ran so much

1259
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,099
further like the fourth you know what's

1260
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:05,780
third or fourth time I'm thinking that

1261
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,369
gave me a lot of encouragement to think

1262
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:09,710
okay I can do this and so I set this

1263
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:12,800
goal for myself that this was like in

1264
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,099
May I remember in May of 1979 or 1778 I

1265
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:17,900
really don't remember anyway but I set

1266
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,430
this goal for myself that I wanted to be

1267
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,050
able to run five miles by the end of the

1268
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,089
summer and at the time it seemed

1269
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:24,680
insurmountable it really did it didn't

1270
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,910
seem like it was even remotely possible

1271
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,690
to me

1272
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,030
but I thought that was my goal and so I

1273
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,520
went out and being kind of a methodical

1274
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,750
person I

1275
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,000
out and I bought a journal a running

1276
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,610
Journal and a stopwatch and of course

1277
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:38,960
the running shoes and all this kind of

1278
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,130
good stuff and so I set out to set up to

1279
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,580
just start running and immediately ran

1280
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,940
into a set of obstacles and those

1281
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,480
obstacles had to do with like it wasn't

1282
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,490
a part of my identity because every time

1283
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,470
I said okay I'm gonna go and go running

1284
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,750
well can't we go run well what do you

1285
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,540
think happened all these conflicting and

1286
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,210
competing thoughts flooded my brain like

1287
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,030
okay it's too hot it's too cold I ran

1288
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,010
three or four days ago nobody I know

1289
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,230
none of my friends are doing this you

1290
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,270
know my crane and the biggest one of

1291
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:18,640
course was I'll go after this program

1292
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,550
and of course I never went so I would

1293
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,030
say that out of all the times that I

1294
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,700
when I said I am going I want to run I

1295
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,010
would say that I managed to actually get

1296
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,680
my shoes on and get out the door maybe

1297
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,890
30% of the time okay and and but that

1298
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,380
30% of time I was like I was improving

1299
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,070
okay

1300
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,110
and and you know and I was actually

1301
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,730
getting further and further and getting

1302
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,930
encouraged but at but I realized as as

1303
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,670
as I could run foot run further and

1304
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,290
further like I was up to a mile maybe or

1305
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,970
a mile a quarter or something because I

1306
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,980
feel III marked it all off in terms of

1307
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,630
like every half mile kind of thing of

1308
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,450
the course that I did so I realized that

1309
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,690
that I was getting so enthused over the

1310
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,970
fact that I was even getting that far

1311
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,710
that I thought I needed a mechanism to

1312
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,030
get the five miles because I thought I'd

1313
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,100
quit well I mean I thought I quit is

1314
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,080
that if I got the two miles that was so

1315
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,970
far beyond what I thought I could ever

1316
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,680
do anyway that what would compel me to

1317
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,860
go to five and so I don't know why I

1318
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,150
thought that way but that's what I did I

1319
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,720
really did

1320
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,060
so I established what I called the five

1321
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,570
mile rule and the five mile rule was if

1322
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,160
I managed to get through all my

1323
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,930
conflicting and competing thoughts and

1324
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,570
if I managed to get through those and

1325
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,550
actually get my shoes on and get outside

1326
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,180
and take one step forward that I had to

1327
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,310
always run at least one step further

1328
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,109
than I did the time before and

1329
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,249
knew what that was because I kept the

1330
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:48,450
journal I knew exactly where I stopped

1331
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,559
so my rule was I always had to go I

1332
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,390
could go more than one step but I had to

1333
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,029
be at least one step and what I found

1334
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,499
and this was really interesting because

1335
01:00:58,499 --> 01:01:00,480
what I found is that there was a

1336
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,400
threshold there was a certain threshold

1337
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,239
point at which in which you know all the

1338
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:08,190
conflicting and competing thoughts went

1339
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:12,210
away and it was like there I just became

1340
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,730
I became a runner it was like I didn't

1341
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,519
have to I didn't have to force myself to

1342
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:19,859
go out and run anymore I actually felt

1343
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,989
compelled to run and in a sense what I

1344
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:24,150
did was create a new sense of identity

1345
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,160
like some people might call it a habit

1346
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,599
or whatever I just call her a new sense

1347
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,609
of identity I actually established a

1348
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:37,109
belief that said I established a belief

1349
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:47,239
that said I am a runner that's who I am

1350
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,249
you see it's like it's like it was

1351
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,099
people then my friends and family they

1352
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:54,630
all thought that I was really

1353
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,930
disciplined because see because that's

1354
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,160
what I say about that most people think

1355
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,180
discipline is a personality

1356
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,249
characteristic I don't define it that

1357
01:02:02,249 --> 01:02:03,630
way at all I've defined it is simply a

1358
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:07,619
technique for change because when we see

1359
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:09,839
somebody doing something that we can't

1360
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,880
do that we'd like to do but we have a

1361
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,369
problem with it we just naturally think

1362
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:15,960
that they have the same kind of problems

1363
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,789
and that they're being disciplined and

1364
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:19,109
doing it and that's not the case at all

1365
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:21,150
if you're doing something effortlessly

1366
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,660
it's because it's who you are there was

1367
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,279
a threshold point like I said where

1368
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:28,319
we're all the conflicting energy just

1369
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:34,289
completely dissipated and instead of me

1370
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:37,289
having to say consciously say to myself

1371
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:40,259
oh I'm gonna go out and run I actually

1372
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,099
felt compelled to run then I got no I

1373
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,619
got to the five miles and then I got to

1374
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:49,200
the point where I was running so much

1375
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,180
that I actually had to establish a

1376
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,759
corollary belief to learn how to listen

1377
01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:55,410
to my body because there were days where

1378
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,420
my body was basically saying hey this is

1379
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,170
not a good day

1380
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,779
and give yourself a rest and that had to

1381
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:02,730
be alright but for a while it wasn't

1382
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,049
because when you start injuring yourself

1383
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:06,359
then you know you're overdoing it so I

1384
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:07,859
actually had to establish a belief that

1385
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:12,089
it was all right not to run so it went

1386
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,670
from went from conflicting and competing

1387
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,760
thoughts to this is who I am and now

1388
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,059
it's effortless completely effortless

1389
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:24,380
there's there's no conflict at all

1390
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:27,839
that's what you're going to have to

1391
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,190
learn well that's what you're going to

1392
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,200
learn how to do with your trading you're

1393
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,670
going to learn how to put on a sample

1394
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,410
size of trades where it becomes

1395
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,269
completely effortless where there's no

1396
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:37,619
conflicting you're competing thoughts

1397
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,849
about what it is that you're doing and

1398
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,099
why you're doing it it wouldn't even

1399
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:42,869
occur to you not to make it wouldn't

1400
01:03:42,869 --> 01:03:44,250
even occur to you to make the kind of

1401
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,359
mistakes that you typically make now

1402
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,349
that's what you want to do you want to

1403
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:51,059
get to the point where it doesn't even

1404
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,279
occur to you it doesn't even enter your

1405
01:03:53,279 --> 01:04:00,599
brain does everybody understand that

1406
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,869
example

1407
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,179
like I said when you when you realize

1408
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,769
that you're not appropriately focused on

1409
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,239
your objective meaning you notice that

1410
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:17,409
you're either thinking saying or doing

1411
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:19,299
something that's inconsistent with what

1412
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:20,199
you're trying to accomplish

1413
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:22,149
you deliberately refocus your attention

1414
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,729
on the object of your goal just do the

1415
01:04:24,729 --> 01:04:31,419
best you can okay so so basically like I

1416
01:04:31,419 --> 01:04:33,279
said this whole section this last

1417
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,559
section is is giving you steps and

1418
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:36,939
techniques for evolving into a

1419
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,549
professional traders mindset so what you

1420
01:04:39,549 --> 01:04:40,869
want to do is you want to resolve

1421
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:44,619
andalusia yourself my desire is to be a

1422
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,089
certain way so that I can make a

1423
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:47,559
consistent income from my training

1424
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,489
something I can rely on so I resolved to

1425
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:53,319
stop analyzing or trying to figure out

1426
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:54,519
if the current opportunity to put on a

1427
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:57,819
trade is going to work resolved to stop

1428
01:04:57,819 --> 01:04:59,739
doing that and when you find yourself

1429
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:02,380
doing it consciously we focus your

1430
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:06,279
thoughts that analyzing is not

1431
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:10,359
beneficial in any way as the passive

1432
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:11,829
technical trader you are dependent on

1433
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:13,599
other the behavior of the traders to

1434
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,219
make you you make your trade a winner

1435
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:17,499
and you are using a mathematical formula

1436
01:05:17,499 --> 01:05:18,849
or price pattern to predict what they

1437
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,189
will do math formulas or price patterns

1438
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:22,959
don't know the intentions objectives or

1439
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,909
reasons why the individual traders who

1440
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:27,459
are capable of moving prices behave the

1441
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:29,319
way they do as a result you will almost

1442
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:31,209
never know the real reason why any

1443
01:05:31,209 --> 01:05:33,039
particular trade worked or not there's

1444
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,799
nothing to analyze there's just nothing

1445
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:41,709
to analyze nothing there was a back in

1446
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:44,169
back when I was in you know commercial

1447
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:48,639
casualty sales there was a sales course

1448
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,709
that I bought by zigzagging everybody

1449
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:54,309
but I was the executor is okay and there

1450
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:56,079
was a part of this part of this sales

1451
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,179
course where Zig Ziglar talking about

1452
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:00,309
the exact right moment to ask a closing

1453
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:03,459
question to close the sale and you know

1454
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,869
and I said he and and you know who's

1455
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:06,339
trying to get people to understand when

1456
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:08,229
that right moment is and when you know

1457
01:06:08,229 --> 01:06:11,529
where you're at that right moment Zig

1458
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:14,099
Ziglar pause and there was silence and

1459
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,170
then he screamed shut up

1460
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:20,500
he screams out much louder than that

1461
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,960
shut up the first person who talks to

1462
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,200
loses in other words when you ask that

1463
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,050
closing question as a salesman shut up

1464
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,510
and don't say a word because if he said

1465
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,830
the first one who talks lose and that

1466
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:37,370
was a truth that worked I found when I

1467
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,190
felt compelled to talk before he did I

1468
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:43,520
didn't get the sale and when I was able

1469
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,080
to keep my mouth shut and let them talk

1470
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,530
first I did what I'm saying to you is

1471
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,810
that when you get a signal from your

1472
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:56,000
methodology stop thinking there's

1473
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,320
nothing to think about there's nothing

1474
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,890
to think about

1475
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,990
do you understand why I said that just

1476
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:15,310
put on the train there's absolutely

1477
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,460
nothing to think about

1478
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,060
just put the train on

1479
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,300
so you resolved to stop analyzing okay I

1480
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,950
resolve I'm gonna I'm gonna analyze

1481
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,950
anymore when I get a signal I'm gonna

1482
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:39,460
stop thinking resolve to learn the skill

1483
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,570
of trading without fear

1484
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:42,820
in other words manager expectations by

1485
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,260
discarding the trade by trade approach

1486
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,820
in a favor of a series of trades

1487
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,810
approaches what we've been talking about

1488
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:49,330
for the last half an hour the pitfalls

1489
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,310
of a trade by trade perspective anything

1490
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,230
you do for any reason can result in a

1491
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,420
winning trade the problem is many of the

1492
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,190
things that you could do that results in

1493
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,720
a winning trade could reinforce trading

1494
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,040
behaviors that could lead to a

1495
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,530
catastrophic loss losing streaks can

1496
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,940
usually cause one's attitude to

1497
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,650
deteriorate into a negative spiral when

1498
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,290
you trade and trade by trade perspective

1499
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,580
from a trade by trade perspective you

1500
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,840
are making a choice to pick what you

1501
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,390
think is an edge out of all the other

1502
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,860
possible trades you could have picked in

1503
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,960
essence you are saying I am picking this

1504
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,960
trade because I think it's going to work

1505
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,279
when you trade in a trade by trade

1506
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,210
perspective you can't help but think you

1507
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,589
know it's going to happen next because

1508
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:28,630
you are picking trades that you only

1509
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:30,130
picking trades that you think are going

1510
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:35,380
to work and therefore you your

1511
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,990
expectations automatically will not be

1512
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,670
in line with the realities of the market

1513
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,609
from its perspective is therefore have a

1514
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:45,339
threat will have the potential to define

1515
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:47,319
and interpret market information in a

1516
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:49,569
threatening way therefore causing your

1517
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:51,130
perception of that information be all

1518
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,689
out of whack and you're gonna end up

1519
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:54,120
trading in very things you want to avoid

1520
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,920
which is lose and make money or losing

1521
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,979
and and be wrong you guys with me on

1522
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:05,410
this the reality is that a rational

1523
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,760
level you don't know if any trade is

1524
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,109
going to work because you never know for

1525
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:10,149
sure who's participating and what their

1526
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:15,130
intent is you're guessing see you know

1527
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:16,950
what you know what traders is an

1528
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,960
educated guess this is what we do as

1529
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:33,089
traders edge got an edge you cated guess

1530
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:38,810
that means probabilities you're making

1531
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,719
an educated guess you've got the

1532
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,479
probabilities in your favor that's all

1533
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,079
we're doing here

1534
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,910
with a specific expectation of the

1535
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,440
outcome any market information that

1536
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,450
doesn't conform to what you expect will

1537
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,130
be perceived as threatening you will be

1538
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:11,460
trading with fear if you win you think

1539
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,900
you're right and if you lose you think

1540
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,430
you're wrong in either case you'll be

1541
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:15,870
setting yourself up to make a trading

1542
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:18,180
err on the next trade just think about

1543
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,000
what I just said regardless of what

1544
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,790
happens if you're right or you've even

1545
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:26,160
or if you're wrong in either case you're

1546
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,450
setting yourself up to make a trading

1547
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,430
error on the next trade because our

1548
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,900
minds have the natural tendency to

1549
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,150
connect the past with the present if the

1550
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,140
trade was a winner

1551
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,430
in other words if you're training in a

1552
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,770
trade by trade perspective and you think

1553
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,710
you were right because you won in other

1554
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,600
words whatever reason you use the market

1555
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,390
seemed to validate that reason we know

1556
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:49,860
now that that just is not the case if

1557
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,630
the trade was a winner we're susceptible

1558
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:54,600
to on the next trade not pre defining

1559
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,370
the risk well the last one was a winner

1560
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,650
I knew for that reason I knew what was

1561
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,120
happening therefore the risk doesn't

1562
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,760
exist not letting ourselves get stopped

1563
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,980
out of a loser jumping the gun because

1564
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,820
you're anticipating the signal over

1565
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:16,830
trading our position sighs not booking

1566
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:18,780
any profits because you think it's gonna

1567
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:24,060
go on forever is this making sense to

1568
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,730
everybody if the trade was a loser

1569
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,650
you're susceptible to not pre defying

1570
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:34,350
the risk because you're gonna gather all

1571
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,850
the information that's necessary to make

1572
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,530
sure it's not gonna be a loser this time

1573
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:40,160
otherwise I wouldn't be putting it on

1574
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,980
right you're gonna analyze it to death

1575
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,600
you're gonna hesitate get in late or not

1576
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,720
get in at all take profits too soon or

1577
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,340
revenge trading by not booking any

1578
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,350
profits in other words whatever the

1579
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,690
markets giving you ain't enough I gotta

1580
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,180
have more the last trade was a loser I

1581
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,990
gotta have more

1582
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,520
the benefits of a series of trains

1583
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:10,150
perspective you know exactly what

1584
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:11,590
behavior serve your purpose and what

1585
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:14,230
behaviors do not you cannot trade in a

1586
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,670
series of trades perspective with a

1587
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,490
trading plan and not know exactly what

1588
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:20,050
behaviors will serve your purpose and

1589
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,450
what behaviors will not because

1590
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,970
everything is planned out you either

1591
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,850
fall in your plan and you're not but the

1592
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:31,870
point is everything is planned you are

1593
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,000
not picking individual trades therefore

1594
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,580
no one trade has any more or any less

1595
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,280
significance than the other the next

1596
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,290
trade this trade they're all just trades

1597
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,480
none of them have any more or any less

1598
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,420
significance you will gain a sense of

1599
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,040
freedom to flow in and out of your

1600
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,020
trades without conflict because you are

1601
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,910
not living or dying on the outcome of

1602
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:55,510
any particular trade by reducing the

1603
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,890
number of variables you will be learning

1604
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:59,560
what works and what doesn't by truly

1605
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,210
accepting that the outcome of this trade

1606
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,400
can be different than whatever happened

1607
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,780
the last time you are positively

1608
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,140
managing your expectations now think

1609
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,610
about what I just said by truly

1610
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:13,300
accepting what does it mean to truly

1611
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,220
accept it means that there's no other

1612
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,160
part of your identity or consciousness

1613
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,610
that isn't conflict with accepting the

1614
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,370
fact genuinely accepting the fact that

1615
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,110
this trade could have a different

1616
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,310
outcome than the last one

1617
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,500
if this laughs the last trade was a

1618
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,270
winner it means that this trade could

1619
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,440
have a different outcome it could be a

1620
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:32,770
loser

1621
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,750
if the last trade was a loser it means

1622
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,920
that this trade could have a different

1623
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,750
outcome it could be a winner you see our

1624
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,910
minds don't feel like there's anything

1625
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:45,730
wrong with you by thinking in the

1626
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:47,860
previous way because our minds are wired

1627
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,350
to think that way our minds are

1628
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,390
literally wired to connect the two

1629
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:55,180
that's why it's so difficult for many

1630
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,460
people to break through into this into

1631
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,520
this ability to think in probabilities

1632
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,380
and to break into the this threshold of

1633
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,980
consistency is because we're working in

1634
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,340
some cases against natural wiring it is

1635
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,770
natural for our minds to say if this is

1636
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,690
what happened the last time if the

1637
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,340
circumstances are identical or similar

1638
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,500
this time then the same

1639
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,600
things going to happen what I'm saying

1640
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,610
to you is that you have to you have to

1641
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:24,180
you have to step into an exercise where

1642
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:28,110
you consciously disconnect the two in

1643
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,820
other words your whole purpose is to

1644
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,730
disconnect this now moment from what

1645
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:35,040
happened the last time because there is

1646
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,200
no connection the reality is there's no

1647
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,080
connection that's the truth you just

1648
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,520
can't let your mind think that there is

1649
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:50,400
a connection there is no connection

1650
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,190
between what's going between the outcome

1651
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,530
of this now moment opportunity with what

1652
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,900
happened the last time even though the

1653
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,970
variables that are getting you into this

1654
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,800
trade or identifying this opportunity

1655
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:08,160
are identical that creates quite a

1656
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,010
paradox for our brains okay that's why

1657
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,740
people can understand the nature of

1658
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,530
probabilities they can understand them

1659
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,720
but they can't function from that

1660
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,290
perspective you have to train your mind

1661
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,930
to function from that perspective that's

1662
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,100
what separates everyone from the pros

1663
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:35,340
okay you have to train your mind to

1664
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,100
disconnect don't let yourself think that

1665
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,420
there's any connection between now and

1666
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,850
what happened the last time because the

1667
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,470
reality is there is none there really

1668
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,200
it's it I don't care how identical it

1669
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,470
looks

1670
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:58,040
you can use the same mathematical

1671
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,920
formulas and and and and criteria and

1672
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,920
those formulas that apply to market data

1673
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,840
and come up with these patterns but I

1674
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,790
guarantee you the traders that are

1675
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:10,190
operating in the market now are not the

1676
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,199
same traders identically at least not

1677
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:13,820
the same traders as the ones that

1678
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,880
operated the last time therefore there's

1679
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,920
no possible way that there could be a

1680
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:27,440
connection between now and then there's

1681
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,010
no possible way

1682
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,020
when you disconnect when you make that

1683
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,570
disconnection okay you won't perceive

1684
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,670
market information as threatening you'll

1685
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,050
eliminate the potential to make a

1686
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,090
trading error and you will be aspiring

1687
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:55,630
to trade without fear in a carefree

1688
01:16:55,630 --> 01:17:00,580
state of mind now that you understand

1689
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,500
that your technical methodology does not

1690
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,970
tell you what will happen next on a

1691
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,970
trade by trade basis in this section I

1692
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,110
will take you through a step-by-step

1693
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:10,600
process that will integrate the

1694
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,400
principles of consistency as a

1695
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,600
functional part of your trading

1696
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,970
personality up to this point we've

1697
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:20,440
talked about how we get into this

1698
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,060
mindset about resolving to think in

1699
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,970
certain ways but this is this is

1700
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,280
learning how to disconnect in other

1701
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,200
words learning how to circumvent that

1702
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,110
natural mechanism in our mind that

1703
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,660
automatically connects things connect

1704
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,280
similar events this now moment

1705
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,960
opportunity there's not more an event

1706
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,670
with something that's in our mind as a

1707
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,990
memory if there's enough so you know if

1708
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,030
there's enough similarity there it'll

1709
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,550
it'll tap us into a state of mind that's

1710
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,800
identical to our memories as opposed to

1711
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,810
what might be available in the now

1712
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,760
moment which may be very different then

1713
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,100
you know may very different than what we

1714
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,080
think that it is I mean that's where you

1715
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,280
know that's where we have relationship

1716
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,920
problems communication problems you know

1717
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,870
it's like it's this this this this

1718
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:08,500
connect mechanism really does cause us a

1719
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,330
lot of problems it really does because

1720
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,220
in many cases a lot of the pain and

1721
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,550
heartache that we feel in our lives is

1722
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:17,200
not connected at all with what's really

1723
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,490
happening in that moment but you

1724
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,660
wouldn't be able to convince ourselves

1725
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,640
or no one would be able to convince us

1726
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,630
or wouldnt be able to convince ourselves

1727
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,910
that what we weren't experiencing in

1728
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,640
that moment wasn't real because what we

1729
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,940
were experiencing was the energy it was

1730
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:34,180
the the fear the confidence the

1731
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,360
dissatisfaction the betrayal you know

1732
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,390
the energy of it is is real that you

1733
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:43,470
can't say this is not what's happening

1734
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,550
but the problem is that the

1735
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:47,530
interpretation of the information that

1736
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,450
tapped us into the state of mind and the

1737
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,430
connection that our mind automatically

1738
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,790
may

1739
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:54,310
from this moment to some memory in the

1740
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,590
past could be like I said completely

1741
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:00,520
erroneous we knew when you look at when

1742
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,350
you look at the very nature of the

1743
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,560
universe and the way it exists there is

1744
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,440
no possible way that any moment could

1745
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,800
ever duplicate itself no two moments are

1746
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,480
ever alike ever and could never be

1747
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,470
because if you just look at it if you

1748
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:18,940
look at physical reality is constructed

1749
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,760
of atoms and molecules and those atoms

1750
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,190
and molecules are in constant motion

1751
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:28,360
they are in constant motion for two

1752
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,210
moments to ever duplicate themselves it

1753
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,590
means that all the atoms of all the

1754
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,480
molecules would have to be in the exact

1755
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,950
same spot they were in some previous

1756
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,650
moment right now and ain't going to

1757
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:42,490
happen so when you really get right down

1758
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:45,300
to it every moment is really unique

1759
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,710
every moment in the environment is

1760
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:49,960
really unique but our minds don't

1761
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,840
process information that way every

1762
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,450
moment in the market is genuinely and

1763
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:58,060
truly unique but our minds don't process

1764
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,300
it that way we have to train our minds

1765
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,520
to process it that way if we want to

1766
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,610
make ourselves the casino if we want to

1767
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,950
put ourselves in the situation where we

1768
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:11,590
are the casino then we've got to get our

1769
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,510
minds to process information in a

1770
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:16,180
different way Richard have had a comment

1771
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:18,610
that I thought was really good we tend

1772
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,520
to associate with a winning trade or a

1773
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,550
losing trade that when we do suffer a

1774
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:26,410
loss oh we tend to think of ourselves as

1775
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:29,560
a loser instead of that is just a trade

1776
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,260
that turned out a loss right and when we

1777
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,590
so when we do get a winning trade we

1778
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:36,850
think well I'm a winner

1779
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:40,090
so you get caught up in the emotion of

1780
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:42,220
it instead of looking at it

1781
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,770
that was a bad trade this was a good

1782
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:47,470
trade it has nothing to do with whether

1783
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,900
or not you're a win or a loser

1784
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,000
Richard have you ever played the slots

1785
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,690
no never

1786
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:56,430
well yes why couldn't you say yes like

1787
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,310
not anymore because no say no did I say

1788
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,380
have you ever played the slots yes sir

1789
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,770
okay

1790
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:08,510
when when the tumblers didn't come up

1791
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:11,010
with any kind of a jackpot did you think

1792
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,060
of yourself as a loser

1793
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:18,000
no why because I know that the slot

1794
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,740
machine is rigged against me well okay

1795
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,030
but did you think there's any

1796
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,290
possibility of ever winning

1797
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:28,490
I absolutely because I did get some

1798
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,600
virtually ended up with an empty pocket

1799
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,750
but in other words you you you walked

1800
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,070
into it with a belief that on any

1801
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:36,540
particular time that you push the button

1802
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,400
that there's a random outcome correct

1803
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,710
you knew that right and so therefore you

1804
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,080
didn't think of yourself as a loser

1805
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,160
correct not have you ever thought of

1806
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,660
yourself as a loser when he had a losing

1807
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,490
trade yes and what would be the reason

1808
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:52,380
because I lost no because you didn't

1809
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,610
because you didn't believe that there

1810
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,350
was a random outcome right if you

1811
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,790
believed if someone told you from the

1812
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:59,520
very beginning that that whatever

1813
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,230
outcomes that you experienced from any

1814
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:03,390
methodology that you picked to define an

1815
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,360
edge were random would you be thinking

1816
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,740
about this completely differently makes

1817
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,320
a big difference yeah so nobody wouldn't

1818
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,510
have the same emotional problems that

1819
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,160
that you might have with the kind of

1820
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,530
errors and and and and everything else

1821
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,180
that goes along with trading with fear

1822
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,710
if someone would have just said to you

1823
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,560
you know what there's a random outcome

1824
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,120
now even though it's a pattern and it

1825
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,230
doesn't make sense and it creates a

1826
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,910
paradox for our minds we've got a

1827
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,740
pattern that produces a random outcome

1828
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,840
if you believed that there was a random

1829
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,300
outcome where would the emotions come

1830
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,630
from they would go they would certainly

1831
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,070
diminish it well there wouldn't be I

1832
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,090
don't think they'd be anywhere at all

1833
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,700
with anyway yes no I'm saying if you

1834
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,780
just right from the very start

1835
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,120
what would you have to associate with if

1836
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,800
it's a random outcome that you know that

1837
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,560
you're not wrong right great so there

1838
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,030
wouldn't be anything to associate the

1839
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:53,130
outcome with any kind of interpretation

1840
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,230
that that could end up causing you to

1841
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,690
feel some sort of emotional pain you're

1842
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,550
right

1843
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,810
all we're trying to do is get to that

1844
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,730
place now even though you've had all

1845
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:04,830
this backlog of experience telling you

1846
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:06,900
otherwise that's where we want to get to

1847
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,640
how are we going to get there we're

1848
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:13,320
going to create an exercise nor the five

1849
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,090
mile rule okay we're going to do we're

1850
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,920
going to do the five mile rule

1851
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,640
in a training exercise why are we going

1852
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,650
to do the exercise remember we have to

1853
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,390
be have to have clarity of intent what

1854
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,699
is our desire our desire is to become a

1855
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:29,340
consistently successful trader one where

1856
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,190
I can I can generate an income I can

1857
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:39,960
rely on okay and so we are going to

1858
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:45,510
actually trade for a new reason we're

1859
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:47,790
going to stay focused in the process of

1860
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:52,679
trading as opposed to the outcome the

1861
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,840
typical trader is obsessed with the

1862
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,030
outcome of a trade the professional

1863
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:59,160
trader is focused in the process of

1864
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,230
trading and letting the outcomes take

1865
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:08,520
care of themselves as a matter of fact

1866
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,989
the best traders that I've ever

1867
01:24:09,989 --> 01:24:14,780
encountered love the process of trading

1868
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,699
the typical trader on the other hand

1869
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:22,350
either has no awareness of the actual

1870
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,719
process of trading or really doesn't

1871
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,850
like the process of trading but they're

1872
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:31,190
addicted to or obsessed with the outcome

1873
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,440
so you have to make up your mind and

1874
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,060
everyone in this room at some point in

1875
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:41,219
their lives for some reason has decided

1876
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:43,020
to make up their mind about something

1877
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:48,290
and when you have you've got results

1878
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:50,969
everyone has I know everyone has had

1879
01:24:50,969 --> 01:24:53,940
that experience you've made up your mind

1880
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,130
with so much desire so much clarity of

1881
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,650
intent and and with with absolute

1882
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:01,199
sincerity that you've got the desired

1883
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:08,940
result so I'm saying that if you make up

1884
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,090
your mind to trade for a new reason the

1885
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:14,760
reason is the acquisition of skills as

1886
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,100
opposed to the outcome or how much money

1887
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,140
you're making you will acquire those

1888
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,330
skills and then you'll find that the

1889
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:24,710
outcomes just take care of themselves

1890
01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:28,570
if you've paper traded or tested your

1891
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,090
methodology to the point where you have

1892
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,580
confidence that you have something that

1893
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:38,889
can generate consistent results then you

1894
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:43,060
can do this exercise if you haven't then

1895
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,170
you're going to have to do that first

1896
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,060
you're going to have to you're going to

1897
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,210
have to plan your trades in other words

1898
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,830
you're going to have to take your

1899
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:54,369
methodology and determine a given set of

1900
01:25:54,369 --> 01:25:56,290
rigid variables because what we're going

1901
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,630
to do is set up a training exercise with

1902
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,670
just a simple twenty five trade or

1903
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,010
twenty trade sample size in other words

1904
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:05,020
what you're going to say is that I am

1905
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:09,489
willing to invest in the development of

1906
01:26:09,489 --> 01:26:13,270
these skills the skill of learning to

1907
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:16,239
trade without fear learning to think in

1908
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,920
probabilities because when you learn to

1909
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,300
think of probability as a fear will go

1910
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,869
away and so what I essentially have to

1911
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:26,710
do is convince myself I have to step in

1912
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:29,679
to purposefully step into an experience

1913
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,260
where I am convinced where I literally

1914
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,599
convinced myself that these principles

1915
01:26:34,599 --> 01:26:38,710
are true now they sound true to you they

1916
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:41,260
might resonate as the truth but you have

1917
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,699
to keep in mind that you might have a

1918
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:45,849
backlog of of any number of experiences

1919
01:26:45,849 --> 01:26:48,400
that that would support beliefs that

1920
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,239
would argue otherwise because I could

1921
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,520
say to you that if I set up or you set

1922
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,060
up an exercise where you said okay I've

1923
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:00,340
got a particular set of variables that

1924
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,920
when they appear in the market that is

1925
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,260
my edge and that my edge will produce

1926
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,349
let's say even 60% winning trades and

1927
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:09,610
you don't even have to have 60% you're

1928
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,860
gonna have 50% and still make consistent

1929
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,929
money as long as what you have to risk

1930
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,179
to find out if it works is you know a

1931
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:17,980
third or a half of what you normally get

1932
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,389
when the front when the trade does work

1933
01:27:19,389 --> 01:27:24,639
in terms of profits but if we set this

1934
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,159
exercise up so that there aren't that

1935
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,080
there's no wiggle room there is no

1936
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,719
wiggle room what I mean by wiggle room

1937
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:35,170
is that the variables the criteria that

1938
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:38,020
you use are absolutely rigid black and

1939
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,459
white

1940
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:41,709
they either they're either present or

1941
01:27:41,709 --> 01:27:43,989
they are not that's the only decision

1942
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:45,969
you have to make are the in other words

1943
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:47,559
if you do it and you do it in terms of

1944
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:49,869
lights whatever lights you're going to

1945
01:27:49,869 --> 01:27:51,610
use whatever timeframe the lights you're

1946
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:53,650
going to use in whatever timeframe they

1947
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:56,260
are either on or they're not and if

1948
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,360
they're on you are obligated to take the

1949
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,539
trade and what you're going to say to

1950
01:28:01,539 --> 01:28:03,159
yourself is that in this whatever

1951
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:05,679
whatever criteria or a plan that you set

1952
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,559
up is I am NOT going to take just the

1953
01:28:08,559 --> 01:28:12,070
next trade I am going to take the next

1954
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:21,639
twenty trades I'm going you are

1955
01:28:21,639 --> 01:28:24,820
committing yourself to taking the next

1956
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:27,550
twenty trades of the occurrence of your

1957
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:33,249
edge you will know in advance based on

1958
01:28:33,249 --> 01:28:36,729
testing and paper trading exactly the

1959
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:38,769
optimum amount that you have to risk in

1960
01:28:38,769 --> 01:28:43,030
other words what your risk is on each

1961
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,579
trade it is not going to be a very it's

1962
01:28:45,579 --> 01:28:47,409
not going to be a varying amount it's

1963
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:50,409
going to be a specific amount whether

1964
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:52,630
it's in terms of dollars or distance

1965
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,699
there will be a specific amount so that

1966
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:57,039
you know exactly how much each trade is

1967
01:28:57,039 --> 01:28:58,659
going to possibly potentially could cost

1968
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:02,889
you and it should really be set up as a

1969
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:06,760
rigid profit profit potential - in other

1970
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,840
words I don't want you making subjective

1971
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,119
decisions it's about how far how far

1972
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:11,349
you're gonna let the market go in your

1973
01:29:11,349 --> 01:29:13,590
favour

1974
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:17,019
so if you can you can get a set of

1975
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,389
variables well let's say you even two to

1976
01:29:19,389 --> 01:29:21,699
one or even one to have to want one and

1977
01:29:21,699 --> 01:29:24,010
a half to one meaning that that if I

1978
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:27,010
have to risk one point of something even

1979
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:28,989
if it's let's say in stocks of it I have

1980
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:32,860
to risk a dollar to make that that my

1981
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,539
particular my particular set of

1982
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:37,030
variables my entry variables will get me

1983
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:41,260
into a trade where if I risk a buck I'll

1984
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,510
get two dollars sixty percent of the

1985
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:46,209
time or fifty percent of the time then

1986
01:29:46,209 --> 01:29:48,329
that's what you do you do do two to one

1987
01:29:48,329 --> 01:29:50,800
there are trading methodologies that can

1988
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,840
be even the opposite you can even go

1989
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,270
two to one here meaning you could risk

1990
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:58,540
two to get one but in these cases the

1991
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,520
trade has to be the trade has to be 80

1992
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,490
or 90 percent correct you could do it

1993
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:05,770
any percentage as you want as long as it

1994
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:09,280
is fixed there is no regal wiggle room

1995
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,830
there is no subjective decision-making

1996
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:18,430
what so ever am i really clear about

1997
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:18,910
this

1998
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:21,730
there is no subjective decision-making

1999
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,810
whatsoever go ahead the big things in

2000
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:29,320
expectancy are in trading with risk

2001
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,540
reward ratio is you don't know which

2002
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,790
trade is going to be the winning trade

2003
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:39,910
correct and typically you you try to let

2004
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,830
your winning trade get stopped out on

2005
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:43,360
your winning trades but what you're

2006
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,640
saying to us for this exercise is that

2007
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,250
we take a fixed stop understand the

2008
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:52,000
fixed risk but a fix essential profit

2009
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,430
stop you know what if you can set it up

2010
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:56,290
as a trailing stop if you can set your

2011
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:57,820
trailing stops up four you're not making

2012
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,350
any kind of the subjective decision you

2013
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,080
can do that too long if you're

2014
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,140
sophisticated enough to do that then yes

2015
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:06,910
okay most most traders in these

2016
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,860
situations are not that's why I make it

2017
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:12,520
real easy okay as long as long as it's

2018
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,290
as long as you're not making any

2019
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,000
decisions so in other words what you're

2020
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,310
saying is that if the market goes X

2021
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:20,830
number of points in my favor I move my

2022
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:23,290
my trailing stop up to a certain

2023
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:25,660
percentage below where the market is

2024
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:27,610
right now and you don't move that unless

2025
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,050
you get stopped out it moves up another

2026
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:33,310
gradient or whatever and another one I

2027
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:36,420
think standard like deviation beyond

2028
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,890
yeah okay whatever you're using okay

2029
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:41,050
yeah if you can if you can if you could

2030
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,450
do that that's fine

2031
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,150
I just want it I just want all the very

2032
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:48,220
old variables to be completely and

2033
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:54,520
absolutely fixed okay and then you've

2034
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,070
fixed all these variables and so you say

2035
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:59,170
to yourself I'm going to take the next

2036
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,540
20 trades not just the next one but the

2037
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:04,950
next 20 no matter what

2038
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:12,550
no matter what now that means that you

2039
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:15,190
have to be prepared based on the amount

2040
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:17,380
that you have to risk you have to be

2041
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:20,770
prepared to take 20 losses in a row the

2042
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,390
likelihood of that happening are is

2043
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:24,310
about as remote as getting 20 wins in a

2044
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:24,700
row

2045
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,860
but the point is is that the dollar

2046
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,580
value of the risk of each trade

2047
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,560
multiplied by 20 you have to be able to

2048
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,760
afford so you've got to set it up that

2049
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,230
way you've got to set it up so that you

2050
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,230
can afford the dollar value of the risk

2051
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:43,300
of taking 20 losing trades in a row

2052
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,920
because your so what you're saying to

2053
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,140
yourself if taking the risk of taking

2054
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,510
the 20 trades in a row losing 20 trades

2055
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:51,310
in a row based on the amount of shares

2056
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:54,010
that you trade so for example if if the

2057
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,450
standard amount of shares that you trade

2058
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:57,250
would say that you know but if I had

2059
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,750
lost 20 trades in a row based on how

2060
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,370
much I've got a risk is going to be

2061
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,770
$5,000 you say to yourself you know what

2062
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,690
I don't want to spend $5,000 on this

2063
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:08,680
then don't but say I'm willing truly

2064
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:13,360
willing to spend let's say $1,000 then

2065
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,910
set it up where the the amount of

2066
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,880
contracts or shares that you trade

2067
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,090
correspond to adding each one up where

2068
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,950
it comes up to $1,000 even if it means

2069
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,620
is trading 10 shares at a time go down

2070
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:29,080
to a level where it's you're completely

2071
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,240
comfortable with the dollar value you

2072
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,660
have to be completely comfortable and

2073
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:38,800
then when you get an occurrence of your

2074
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,530
edge put the trade on and see what

2075
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:44,110
happens and if it turns out the booty

2076
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,700
would be a winner you think oh hey yeah

2077
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,310
mark Douglas a good take this this is

2078
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:51,460
alright okay yeah so this one turns out

2079
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,680
to be a winner and maybe this one turns

2080
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,050
out to be a winner and maybe well this

2081
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,850
one's a loser you think okay I can

2082
01:33:57,850 --> 01:34:00,450
handle that and this one's a loser oh

2083
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:02,470
and this one's a loser now we've got

2084
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,020
three losers in a row I have rarely met

2085
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,300
a trader who doesn't have a problem with

2086
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,950
the next trade after three losers in a

2087
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:11,100
row

2088
01:34:15,639 --> 01:34:18,980
you you you made the commitment to take

2089
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:23,780
every single trade when the next one

2090
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:28,420
comes up and your mind is screaming no

2091
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:33,050
it's a loser remember how our minds are

2092
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,199
wired to think our minds are wired to

2093
01:34:36,199 --> 01:34:38,119
think that way but that is not the truth

2094
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:41,420
the truth is your methodology the

2095
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,820
mathematical formula does not know what

2096
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:45,230
the outcome of that trade is going to be

2097
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,340
and neither do you

2098
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:52,099
you've got to take it any way you can

2099
01:34:52,099 --> 01:34:54,199
see and when these occurrences when you

2100
01:34:54,199 --> 01:34:56,300
can when you purposefully put yourself

2101
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,380
into a situation where you're

2102
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,030
confronting these conflicting beliefs

2103
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:00,590
because that's what's rearing its head

2104
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:02,300
this is any different than me saying I

2105
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,309
want to go run and then and then you

2106
01:35:04,309 --> 01:35:06,980
know after that program or it's too cold

2107
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,840
it's too hot it's raining whatever it's

2108
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:14,929
the exact same thing you put the trade

2109
01:35:14,929 --> 01:35:17,329
on anyway and it turns out to be a

2110
01:35:17,329 --> 01:35:20,599
winner you are you are convincing

2111
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:22,309
yourself that you don't know what's

2112
01:35:22,309 --> 01:35:26,570
going to happen next because you created

2113
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:29,630
an experience that directly that wasn't

2114
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,969
that directly it can counter dix what

2115
01:35:31,969 --> 01:35:34,429
you thought was true you actually

2116
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:36,980
created an experience that directly

2117
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,559
countered NYX what you thought was true

2118
01:35:38,559 --> 01:35:42,679
and the more of these you run into and

2119
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:43,789
the more times you do it

2120
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:46,130
all of a sudden you're not thinking the

2121
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,829
old way anymore

2122
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:51,079
you are truly and genuinely learning how

2123
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,599
to think in probabilities you are

2124
01:35:53,599 --> 01:35:56,329
integrating thinking of probabilities as

2125
01:35:56,329 --> 01:35:58,989
a core part of your training personality

2126
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:01,250
you may understand the nature of

2127
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,659
probabilities but now you're being able

2128
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:04,369
to function from a probabilistic

2129
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:08,780
perspective because what you're going to

2130
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,489
do is you're going to do this exercise

2131
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:16,039
until you can do it flawlessly you are

2132
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:19,099
going to do this exercise and you do the

2133
01:36:19,099 --> 01:36:22,519
first one and if you don't execute your

2134
01:36:22,519 --> 01:36:24,590
trades completely flawlessly then do it

2135
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:27,200
again now at the end of

2136
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,580
sample size if you don't like the

2137
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,020
outcome if you don't like the results

2138
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,640
meaning the amount of money that you

2139
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,400
made or even loss for that matter

2140
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,340
because that's possible

2141
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:38,600
you don't like the bottom line you can

2142
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,520
tweak your variables you just can't do

2143
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,980
it in the middle of a sample size if you

2144
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,450
want to change your variables at the end

2145
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:46,070
of a sample size you're free to do it

2146
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,670
you cannot do it in the middle of one

2147
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:58,790
cannot absolutely cannot you will keep

2148
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:06,520
doing this exercise until when what what

2149
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,760
well

2150
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,590
yes but there's something else I want to

2151
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,290
get until when Wendy when you how do you

2152
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,610
know that you're how do you know you've

2153
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:15,800
arrived how do you know you've actually

2154
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,630
arrived that you've changed that's right

2155
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,160
you can just there's no conflicting

2156
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,140
energy anymore it doesn't occur to you

2157
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,870
to not do it it doesn't even end of your

2158
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:28,940
brain you don't even get the thought you

2159
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,380
get a signal you put on the train

2160
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,590
you get a signal you put on the train

2161
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:38,360
it's like then then it's who you are you

2162
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,140
guys with me on this

2163
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,940
you you managed to actually work through

2164
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,710
all that conflicting energy and you've

2165
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:53,340
changed you're a different person

2166
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:56,530
because the competing and conflicted for

2167
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,450
conflicting thoughts don't even enter

2168
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:02,860
your consciousness they're not there

2169
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:06,160
anymore because it's not who you are

2170
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,340
anymore

2171
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:19,119
any questions about this this is making

2172
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:26,409
sense to everybody if you're really

2173
01:38:26,409 --> 01:38:29,439
sincere about wanting to generate a

2174
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:30,969
consistent income you'll do this

2175
01:38:30,969 --> 01:38:40,329
exercise and if you're not you won't and

2176
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:42,369
you might not be ready to and that's

2177
01:38:42,369 --> 01:38:43,840
alright whenever you're ready you'll do

2178
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,989
it

2179
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:02,880
but this will work this will work one

2180
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,280
second because you are actively stepping

2181
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,310
into an experience where your desire is

2182
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,940
to change the way that you think instead

2183
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,190
of avoiding the confrontation you are

2184
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:19,440
actually embracing the confrontation big

2185
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,920
difference you are embracing the

2186
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,960
confrontation because the more that you

2187
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:32,700
embrace it the faster it dissipates go

2188
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,080
ahead can you speak a little bit about

2189
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:39,300
their going from paper trading to real

2190
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,250
money I know there's a difference and

2191
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,320
you would say you were trying a new

2192
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,840
strategy or something that you you were

2193
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,110
tweaking you would do paper first and

2194
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:51,750
what would you would you consider I mean

2195
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,760
if you you would you look at each trades

2196
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,980
and if you executed it flawlessly and

2197
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,710
and you say you generated money and then

2198
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,980
you went to the real money how would you

2199
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,950
decide I guess if you lost money to

2200
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:06,210
match my own question here in other

2201
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,190
words what would you expect the

2202
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:10,500
transition to be well that's going to

2203
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,330
depend on the individual one you're

2204
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:13,890
always going to want a paper trade if

2205
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:15,660
you've got a new set of variables that

2206
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,040
you're working with you're always going

2207
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,300
to want to paper trade it to the point

2208
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,910
where you're confident that that you've

2209
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:22,230
got you can get good results

2210
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:24,390
that doesn't mean you can execute good

2211
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,610
results it means that the potential is

2212
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:28,770
there you want to know the potential is

2213
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:30,930
there correct once you know that the

2214
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,450
potential is there then you move see the

2215
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,980
paper trading partners only to find out

2216
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,660
what variables in the market work and

2217
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:38,250
relationship to you know like like

2218
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,960
market movement in relationship to the

2219
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,390
formula okay now we're working on our

2220
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,460
brain okay that's that's the first step

2221
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,440
the second step is that is that do I

2222
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,150
think in a way that's consistent that I

2223
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:50,190
can extract the maximum potential out of

2224
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:52,410
the methodology that means executed

2225
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:55,500
flawlessly so so what you do is you set

2226
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,930
this exercise up in a way that will

2227
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,130
dictate it is how much you're

2228
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:00,840
comfortable with if you how much you're

2229
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,160
comfortable with the dollar amount of

2230
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,630
losing every turn every every single

2231
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:05,970
trade that's how you know how to set it

2232
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:09,960
up that's really key it really is it

2233
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:10,920
means that if you

2234
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:15,270
have to trade one share and you know if

2235
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:17,700
that's all you're comfortable with with

2236
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,760
losing based on the dollar value of how

2237
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:22,050
much you have to risk on each trade

2238
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:24,320
that's based on your analysis by the way

2239
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,720
then do it do and then and then when

2240
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,010
you're cut when you can execute one

2241
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:31,350
share flawlessly over a sample size or

2242
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,480
one or two sample sizes then go to ten

2243
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,250
shares and see how you do it if you

2244
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:37,140
can't do ten shares comfortably and

2245
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:42,060
flawlessly go back to five you're just

2246
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,550
building skills if you stay if you get

2247
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:46,770
your mind out of the out of out of the

2248
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:49,920
money out of the outcome part and focus

2249
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,990
on building the skills once those skills

2250
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:53,100
are there you're gonna make all the

2251
01:41:53,100 --> 01:42:01,920
money you want that makes sense doesn't

2252
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:07,260
it do this exercise and you won't

2253
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:14,070
believe how things will change until you

2254
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:16,260
actually change and it's just like it'll

2255
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:26,640
be they'll be amazing do the exercise so

2256
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,840
there anybody else have any questions

2257
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,410
about how to set this exercise up how

2258
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:33,240
long how long you going to do the

2259
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,070
exercise if you set it up and do it how

2260
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:38,550
long you gonna do it what's the criteria

2261
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:42,000
I understand how many 20 trades sample

2262
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,130
sizes are 25 trade sample size exercises

2263
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,730
are you gonna do that's right so there's

2264
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:49,290
no conflicting and competing thoughts

2265
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,030
good until you can do it flawlessly to

2266
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:52,440
this until you can do it until it's like

2267
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,850
it just a part of who you are it

2268
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:56,010
wouldn't occur to you not to do anything

2269
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:57,870
other than what your rules say it just

2270
01:42:57,870 --> 01:43:00,330
wouldn't even occur to you it doesn't

2271
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:04,370
even doesn't even enter your brain

2272
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,630
and I guarantee you at that point you

2273
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:13,970
will be thinking in probabilities you

2274
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:17,480
will be trading without fear you will be

2275
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,650
trading from a carefree state of mind

2276
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:24,010
that's the payoff

2277
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:34,530
you'll be thinking like a pro

2278
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:43,000
so you want to resolve to focus your

2279
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,650
efforts on developing specific trading

2280
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:46,810
skills and consistent profits will

2281
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:48,730
naturally flow as a byproduct of the

2282
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,970
mastery of these skills the most

2283
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:53,830
successful traders love the process of

2284
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:55,420
trading whereas a typical trader usually

2285
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,340
ignores the process because he's

2286
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:00,330
obsessively focused on the outcome on

2287
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:03,670
these traders that keep saying you know

2288
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,790
do the process and you till you do it

2289
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:08,560
perfectly right what are some of tech

2290
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,300
Falls I mean when I trade I don't really

2291
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:12,340
think that I'm doing too much wrong so

2292
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,890
one curious what all can go wrong on a

2293
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:17,650
trade other than tidying it in wrong all

2294
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:19,270
the things that like all the errors that

2295
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:21,760
I that I mentioned earlier like in turn

2296
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,960
up redefining hurry if you're not doing

2297
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,430
stuff wrong that's fine you know that's

2298
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:28,360
don't don't don't more it don't that

2299
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:31,390
stuff yeah yeah if you're doing a haul

2300
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,340
right and you're doing fine okay I don't

2301
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,330
want to give you the impression that

2302
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,980
that there has to be anything more there

2303
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:39,180
it's you know

2304
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:45,250
okay resolved to commit the five

2305
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,870
fundamental truths about the nature of

2306
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,640
training as core beliefs of your trading

2307
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,830
personality those five fundamental

2308
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:53,560
truths are anything can happen is that

2309
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:57,520
true or not every moment is unique is

2310
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:00,970
that true okay an edge is nothing more

2311
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:02,020
than an indication of a higher

2312
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:03,640
probability of one thing happening over

2313
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,130
another okay is there a random

2314
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,020
distribution between wins and losses on

2315
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,250
any given set of variables that define

2316
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:12,100
an edge yes absolutely do we need to

2317
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,090
know what's going to happen next to

2318
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:16,720
produce a consistent income no you see

2319
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,820
so if you find yourself as you're doing

2320
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,160
this exercise you know with conflicting

2321
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,830
and competing thoughts pay attention to

2322
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:25,750
what you're thinking pay attention to

2323
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,310
what you're about to do as a result of

2324
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:29,260
what you're thinking and then refocus on

2325
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,060
what you want to believe I want to

2326
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,830
believe that anything can happen that

2327
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,240
there's a random distribution that I

2328
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,980
don't need to know and just stay focused

2329
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:38,230
on on these particular beliefs and do

2330
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:40,030
the best you can and keep on doing it

2331
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,350
until it just becomes a part of who you

2332
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:44,350
are it's the right you're absolutely

2333
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:47,560
right it's like a meditation that's

2334
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,960
right your mantra put them up on your

2335
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:53,280
wall or by your computer screen

2336
01:45:54,990 --> 01:46:01,750
because they're all true continually

2337
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:04,390
really resolved to continually reinforce

2338
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:06,100
a belief in your ability to be a

2339
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,260
consistently successful trader by

2340
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:11,380
adopting the traders Creed by the way

2341
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,760
these two things are in the discipline

2342
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,070
training in the zone what I just though

2343
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:16,360
the five fundamental truths and the

2344
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,920
traders Creed are both in training in

2345
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,770
the zone the traders Creed I am a

2346
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:21,970
consistent winner in other words

2347
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:23,740
remember the belief that I put up that I

2348
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:26,470
am a runner never that I said when I

2349
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:29,140
actually became a runner that that

2350
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:31,210
belief compelled me to express myself in

2351
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:32,560
a way that was consistent with that

2352
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,230
belief well what we want to do is

2353
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:40,080
install a belief that says I am a

2354
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:50,800
consistent winner and the subset beliefs

2355
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,740
that you have to have to make this true

2356
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:56,710
will automatically compel you to act or

2357
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:59,200
behave in a way that's consistent with

2358
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,520
that belief why are you a consistent

2359
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,250
winner because I objectively identify my

2360
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,710
edges objectively meaning no

2361
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:10,840
rationalizations justifications are

2362
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,440
building cases I know what criteria

2363
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,330
defines my edge and it's either present

2364
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:19,750
or it's not I predefined the risk of

2365
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:23,710
every trade wouldn't even think about

2366
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:25,300
getting into a train without doing that

2367
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,630
now that doesn't mean because who

2368
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:30,310
brought that up earlier no he's not here

2369
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:33,340
right now that doesn't mean that I

2370
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,490
always put a stop in the market but I

2371
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:39,400
trade subjectively that doesn't mean I

2372
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,790
actually enter a stop but I guarantee

2373
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:45,850
you that whatever price I picked as my

2374
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:49,900
wrist point I never violate not getting

2375
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:52,360
out at that price the market hits my

2376
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:54,640
price I get out that doesn't mean I've

2377
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,000
entered a stop in the market beforehand

2378
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,510
but I can do that I don't have a problem

2379
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:04,180
with that it wouldn't even occur to me

2380
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:06,870
not to do otherwise

2381
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:18,130
I'm a consistent winner because I

2382
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:19,660
completely accept the risk I'm willing

2383
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,940
to scale back or let go of the edge

2384
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:24,820
meaning I am completely free of conflict

2385
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,440
about the amount of money I'm willing to

2386
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,030
spend to find out if this trade is going

2387
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:37,270
to work if you're not completely sure or

2388
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:40,780
let's say completely without conflict

2389
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,040
about the amount of money that it could

2390
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,300
take to find out this trade is going to

2391
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,640
work and scale back to a level that

2392
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:50,920
you're comfortable but the important

2393
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,230
thing is participate even if you have to

2394
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:54,790
scale back again so like I said one

2395
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:57,640
share at least you're participating at a

2396
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,200
level where you've got some money at

2397
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:04,210
risk I act on my edges without

2398
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:05,800
reservation or hesitation I am a

2399
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,780
consistent winner because I act on my

2400
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:10,980
edges without reservation or hesitation

2401
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:13,150
I'm a consistent winner because I

2402
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:15,610
continually monitor my susceptibility to

2403
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:18,480
making trading errors

2404
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:28,949
how do I do that I keep journals

2405
01:49:35,309 --> 01:49:38,699
I pay myself as the market makes money

2406
01:49:38,699 --> 01:49:42,209
available to me I subscribe to a

2407
01:49:42,209 --> 01:49:45,169
philosophy of scaling out of positions I

2408
01:49:45,169 --> 01:49:47,609
like to divide my position up into

2409
01:49:47,609 --> 01:49:50,339
fractions and scale out and quarters or

2410
01:49:50,339 --> 01:49:59,099
thirds that way I'm continually making

2411
01:49:59,099 --> 01:50:05,099
myself a winner as the market makes

2412
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,649
money available I'm extracting money out

2413
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:08,789
of the market because I don't know how

2414
01:50:08,789 --> 01:50:12,109
far the markets gonna go in my favour

2415
01:50:12,109 --> 01:50:14,489
and what I have is I usually have at

2416
01:50:14,489 --> 01:50:16,649
least a quarter or a third on in case it

2417
01:50:16,649 --> 01:50:19,669
just does something that you know I

2418
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:28,349
could have never anticipated and by the

2419
01:50:28,349 --> 01:50:29,999
time I've got just the last third on or

2420
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:32,789
last quarter on anyway and you know I've

2421
01:50:32,789 --> 01:50:35,189
got I've got a trailing stop or you know

2422
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:36,929
at least my place in my mind where I get

2423
01:50:36,929 --> 01:50:39,059
out if it retraces back to back tonight

2424
01:50:39,059 --> 01:50:41,489
you know not far beyond my entry point

2425
01:50:41,489 --> 01:50:49,979
anyway that from that point on and the

2426
01:50:49,979 --> 01:50:52,319
last one I never violate these

2427
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:56,939
principles of success what do you think

2428
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:04,010
guys any questions get them now go ahead

2429
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:08,280
do you ever scale in no I didn't know a

2430
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,139
lot of lot of traders who do I just I

2431
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:11,939
just don't that's things I don't wanna

2432
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:13,319
say that because I don't doesn't mean

2433
01:51:13,319 --> 01:51:16,589
that that I that I don't think it's fine

2434
01:51:16,589 --> 01:51:18,239
I just don't have a particular

2435
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:20,869
methodology right scale and that's all I

2436
01:51:20,869 --> 01:51:24,409
get in all at once

2437
01:51:28,469 --> 01:51:34,929

aspire to never violate to violate the

2448
01:52:06,999 --> 01:52:08,650
principle yeah that's good but that's a

2449
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,389
good point yeah yeah you're making

2450

2453
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,840
success

2454
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,850
