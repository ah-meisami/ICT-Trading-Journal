1. get first signal from @DisciplinedICT  
2. define [NY09:30] in $ESU2023, $NQU2023, $YMU2023  

$ESU2023:  
1.1. define -OB [h4] and MTH [h4] in  
1.2. nice reaction to MTH [h4] in [1m]   
  - After NY 09:30  
  - Rejection From MTH [h4]  
  - Dispalcement  
  - Breaker  
  - Market Structure Shift  

$YMU2023:  
1.1. define -OB [daily] [low]  
1.2. nice reaction to -OB [daily] in [1m]   
  - After NY 09:30  
  - Rejection -OB [daily]
  - Dispalcement  
  - Breaker  
  - Market Structure Shift  

  Strategy:
  1. Look at NY kill Zone
  2. Get confirmation from ES
  3. Entering on YM because it has lower spread
  4. SL above -OB [daily] [low]  
  5. TP at 1st partial [cherry-pick]
