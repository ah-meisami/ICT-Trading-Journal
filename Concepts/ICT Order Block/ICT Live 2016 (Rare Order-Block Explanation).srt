1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,799
okay so um

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,500
let's take a couple uh

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,480
looks at

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,839
the dollar Index and let's begin with

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,279
a daily chart

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
how many of you in here watch the uh the

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
video link I sent out

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,920
now In fairness it's

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,059
it's uh it's really pointed at um

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,860
showing the the strong contrast to

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,500
what I teach what I trade with

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,719
in relationship to what is commonly

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,940
known as supply and demand

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,899
um

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,300
supply and demand is not an ICT order

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,760
block as much as the pundits would like

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,119
to say they are they're not

18
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,939
the way a supply and demand zone is

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,900
created and the way it's perpetuated by

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,220
Sam sedan or

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,640
there's Online Trading Academy guys or

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,740
whoever else subscribes to the view of

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,280
supply and demand they get you to a Zone

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,100
okay and the way the ICT order block

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,140
works is it gives you a specific level

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,360
to look at and then you round it to the

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,920
nearest Round number or institutional

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,780
level and that that's why it's so

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,560
precise it's not leaving you to discern

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,799
or guess as to where in a Zone you want

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
to trade at and that's the fallacy in it

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
all and if you go if you take it down to

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,140
the Bare Bones of supply and demand

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,479
they have

35
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,439
a large subscriber base to it and while

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,700
there are some that will show

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,500
profitability and I've said this in the

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,520
past supply and demand Concepts

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,159
by and large will get you to an area

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,818
where trades will likely form okay but

41
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,099
it will not give you

42
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,319
the trade levels to trade at it will not

43
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,420
give you the X-ray view on how to

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,480
um

45
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,180
narrow down to a specific price level

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,520
which is really necessary necessary for

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,540
obviously defining risk keeping risks

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,959
small manageable and also what level to

49
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,200
shoot for in terms of a profit objective

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,720
so when I get uh tweets I get emails and

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,940
I get other folks that'll you know come

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,019
in and say well you know you're

53
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,780
repackaging reap

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,180
regurgitating and relabeling just

55
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,459
to uh you make myself look good

56
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,700
uh I've been doing this 23 years okay

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,480
and I can tell you what I do isn't out

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,340
there except for what I do

59
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,700
the way I teach it is all me

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,220
um it's not uh I didn't look at supply

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,080
and demand say Let me let me even try to

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
improve on supply and demand I didn't I

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,860
didn't do that supply and demand was

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,300
actually shown to me by a guy on um baby

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,340
Pips with my baby Pips days

66
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,959
um they uh he was really trying to push

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,000
hard and heavy about it and I kind of

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,319
always I can't think at him saying look

69
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,879
you know I understand where you're going

70
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,620
with it but I don't subscribe to that

71
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,720
because it's too vague okay remember

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,580
when you first got involved with uh

73
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,680
trading in the concept of support and

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,780
resistance was introduced to you and

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,400
suddenly because someone's showing you

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,080
an example of a chart but it doesn't

77
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,459
make a difference what time frame it was

78
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,920
but if they showed you a chart and they

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,599
clearly show that the resistance worked

80
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,980
in the past and look how perfect it went

81
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,480
right to that level again and turn

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,799
around went down and then you tried to

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,480
apply that shift to your charts and your

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,819
trading and what happened you Blu-ray on

85
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,379
through it and you had no understanding

86
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,900
of why it did it okay and that's the

87
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,720
same fallacy that goes along with supply

88
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,940
and demand because really all you're

89
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,780
doing is applying trend line analysis

90
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,060
okay and the theory that price will

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,519
bounce off of a trend line okay uh

92
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,260
sloping up or sloping down but you're

93
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,140
just applying it to a Zone okay there's

94
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,580
no reason

95
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,238
to base your assumptions on future price

96
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,720
uh moves I want to Zone a Zone has

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,060
absolutely no basis in your trading

98
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,639
except for highlighting a potential uh

99
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,100
killing ground okay an area where a

100
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,440
trade most likable form but that is in

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,540
no way narrowing down what your

102
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,520
your job is and and fulfilling the role

103
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,020
of you as a Trader because you have to

104
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,400
select where you're going to get in at

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,040
and it has to be a level that makes

106
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,900
sense obviously it has to be a level

107
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,460
that is

108
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,960
um

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,020
building on an idea that there should be

110
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,419
institutional sponsorship at that price

111
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,900
level okay it's not that you look at a

112
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,060
Zone and say okay well

113
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,620
and I I want to finish this thought

114
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,940
because I kind of already moved away

115
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,280
from it when you looked at support and

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
resistance okay supply and demand is the

117
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,860
same thing to that but it just made it

118
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
even worse because you can look at a

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,460
chart and say okay well look

120
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,120
um I looked at this level here

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,560
okay and looking at this we can see the

122
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
price clearly went up to that level in

123
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,639
hindsight perfect 2020 we can see price

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,199
went up there and then it rejected and

125
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,960
went away okay so everyone knows that

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,699
this right here would be deemed as a

127
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,300
resistance level

128
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,020
can you guys hear me

129
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,940
I got a couple people asking if uh

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,039
yeah

131
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,479
um

132
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,460
yeah I'm sorry if you can't hear me it's

133
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,560
going to be on your end guys but it'll

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,419
be in the uh in recording okay

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,699
so looking at the idea of support and

136
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,039
resistance okay

137
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,560
yes I have a module that teaches

138
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,620
specific levels and how to apply support

139
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,380
and resistance but again

140
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,539
much like you probably discerned on your

141
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,020
own uh as a fledgling Trader you found

142
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,000
out that support resistance isn't the

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,740
be-all end-all it's not it's not the

144
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,520
Panacea of trading okay

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
the understanding of why the market

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
should find support resistance there is

147
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,419
the missing link okay and supply and

148
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,600
demand gets close to it it gets you in

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,580
the neighborhood but it never gives you

150
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,580
the address okay it doesn't give you the

151
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,220
access to the price level that you need

152
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
to see where

153
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,060
the institutions are going to come in

154
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,259
and actually do the buying and selling

155
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,300
okay so if you really break it down and

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,580
weigh my work the ICT order block which

157
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,080
is based on real institutional trading

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
and and I've done it I've been in that

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,940
I've been in that field okay I know what

160
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,919
I'm talking about I prove it I show it

161
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,340
to you and the whole context of the myfx

162
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,419
book which we'll talk about and we're

163
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,520
actually going to pull it up is to show

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,319
you that there are folks out there that

165
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,060
will teach you and promise you future

166
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,520
riches but they don't ever teach you how

167
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,660
to get out of the hole you dug for

168
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,099
yourself before you found them if you

169
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,620
did in fact find a good Mentor okay many

170
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,720
of you already know what it's like to be

171
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,180
in drawdown and have had a hard time

172
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,340
getting out of it despite having good

173
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
skill sets again given to you and shared

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,120
with you the psychological barriers the

175
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,280
um routine in the process you got to go

176
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,960
through to get out of it okay and the

177
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,539
thought processes that's necessary to to

178
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,460
adopt to get through that it's it's

179
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,680
that's something that's not taught by

180
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,620
anyone okay so when you get out there

181
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,240
and you start looking at stuff and you

182
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,979
see these guys come out there they want

183
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,199
to you know sound like smart asses uh

184
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,520
well you know you're repackaging

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,020
relaying that stuff has been thrown at

186
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,020
me for 20 years okay and honestly I've

187
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,120
always encouraged it go out and really

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,639
weigh everything I teach in the balances

189
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,380
okay I didn't come out and say I

190
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,539
invented support resistance I didn't

191
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,660
come out and say I invented Fibonacci I

192
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,060
didn't say that I never said that I said

193
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,819
I had all the access that you have as a

194
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,620
new Trader okay with all the retail

195
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,960
stuff and indicators and I weeded out

196
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,580
all the and stuck with the

197
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,520
things that worked okay I found that the

198
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,720
Fibonacci level 70.5 Midway okay and I

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,820
was just flirting around with it okay I

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,620
noticed it didn't go to 79 a lot of

201
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,500
times or 78.6 and a lot of times it

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,779
wouldn't just stop at 62. okay it would

203
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,419
just go right in the middle and the 50

204
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,120
level is kind of like a real weird

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,740
um

206
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,839
phenomenon really it's like it likes to

207
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,959
go halfway somewhere okay and that's why

208
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,880
also I like to take my profits early too

209
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,279
because I don't like to see myself hold

210
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,200
hard and fast to a specific level even

211
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
though I think it may trade to that

212
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
level I want to get out before it gets

213
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,300
there okay so

214
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,820
when I talk about things and when I

215
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,160
teach things okay you'll probably see a

216
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,959
Fibonacci overlaid on my chart not So

217
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,300
Much Anymore recently okay but if you

218
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
look at my work you'll see Fibonacci

219
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,260
okay and it was a tool to help

220
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,420
illustrate returning back inside of a

221
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,580
range that's all it taught it just gives

222
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,839
you a little crutch to find that little

223
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,880
sweet spot to look for but once you

224
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,080
understand price action you don't need

225
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,640
any of that stuff on your chart you

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,779
don't need the moving averages to

227
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,700
discern where institutional order flow

228
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,839
is on the higher time frame because you

229
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,640
know by looking at the price action what

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
it is it's going up or down okay but

231
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,560
when I see these asses get on there and

232
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,600
they say you know you're repackaging or

233
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,580
re-labeling okay first get one thing

234
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,040
straight I'm not selling you anything

235
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,620
secondly I don't care if you like what I

236
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,339
teach

237
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,839
I don't care if you make money or don't

238
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,779
make money I'm doing this because I have

239
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,240
a record of it for my children you just

240
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
are witnesses to it okay believe me if

241
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
it was all about me

242
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,980
making money selling books which I made

243
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,220
a smart remark about because some

244
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,100
um goofball okay on there yeah I made a

245
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,720
snide remark which everybody knows I

246
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,580
don't sell anything but he ran with it

247
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,100
thinking I'm going to be uh you know

248
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,660
selling something down the road I'm not

249
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,100
selling anything okay I don't want

250
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
anything from any one of you okay but I

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,019
am interested to see what uh all of you

252
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,700
do with it and that's all I've asked for

253
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,959
so

254
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
but I'd like to come out here and answer

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,920
some of these things a lot because

256
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,560
I love my trolls as much as I think I'm

257
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,180
upset or mad or anything like that I'm

258
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,580
not I love them I absolutely love them I

259
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,680
hope they stick with me because

260
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,420
if I can convert one of them that's what

261
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm looking to do and they may do it in

262
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,720
secret but I know I'm going to get

263
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
somebody eventually they're going to be

264
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,660
like you know what this guy he really

265
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,120
does tell it like it is okay but their

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,500
feelings are going to be hurt up to that

267
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,399
point

268
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,200
but looking at

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
the tools and applications that I I

270
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,899
teach okay I have to take you out of the

271
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,240
retail World okay but we have to find a

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,300
Common Language okay all of us know what

273
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,519
uh stochastic is we all know what our

274
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,140
PSI is we all know what support

275
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,019
resistance is and supply and demand okay

276
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,260
all those types of things all of them

277
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,779
have their place in trading

278
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,839
now what I'm about to say is going to be

279
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,399
the distinction of whether you stay in

280
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,399
the retail world or you move out and you

281
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,560
go into a professional level mindset

282
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,140
all the retail tools that's on your mt4

283
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,220
platform or your uh

284
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,660
ninjatrader or trading view platforms

285
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,860
all these things that are out there we

286
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,200
have all these toys at our disposal okay

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,540
and just like a child if you throw them

288
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,040
in Toys R Us and you let them run wild

289
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,959
okay they're not going to stick with one

290
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,480
toy they're going to jump and jump and

291
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,620
jump and jump and they're gonna have a

292
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,760
tantrum when you try to take whatever's

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,500
in their hands at the time out

294
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,959
so I had to take every one of you

295
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,839
from the baby Pips days through this

296
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,279
process of going through all kinds of

297
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,820
retail tools just like I did and then

298
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,860
finally showed you the fallacy in and

299
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,260
all now

300
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,060
if I would have told you from the

301
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,260
beginning take everything off your chart

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,339
we're going to look at things like this

303
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,320
half of you would have been like no way

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,600
I need these things I need to have these

305
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
things these are my training wheels

306
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
these are my crutches these are my

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
things are my best friends and it would

308
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,079
have been a barrier to your

309
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,120
understanding and plus I need you to be

310
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
in the charts for a period of time and

311
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,480
that's not a little bit of time it's

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
going to be a period of time seeing

313
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,899
things repeatedly throwing at you talked

314
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:28,640
about

315
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,019
spoken of hinted out it's going to go

316
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,459
here it's going to go there look for

317
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,380
price to go here and then seeing it

318
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,519
unfold

319
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,140
that's where the learning comes from

320
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,880
it's not applying an indicator it's not

321
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,740
applying regurgitated horse that

322
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,200
everyone accuses me of okay everything

323
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,899
that I teach is completely alien to what

324
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,579
is out there in the real world okay of

325
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,899
retail Trading

326
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,079
the professional mindset that I

327
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,899
hopefully try to cultivate in the things

328
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,459
that I do

329
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,579
it largely is hinged on your ability to

330
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,260
spend time in the price charts yourself

331
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,740
okay my model isn't okay now look at me

332
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,200
now here's what I'm going to do I'm

333
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,760
going to do this and you're going to do

334
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,160
the same thing and only thing that does

335
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,440
is teaches you number one dependency and

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,700
I don't want dependency the whole thing

337
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,980
starts from my children I want them to

338
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,320
be independent of me

339
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,660
and when I go and move on to wherever I

340
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,060
go and the other life or if I choose not

341
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,560
to uh you know do anything with trading

342
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,500
anymore yeah the the resources that I'm

343
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,540
making available are for them they're

344
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,100
they are able to look at this stuff

345
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,240
there's a lot of things that I'm not

346
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,800
going to make available but it's just

347
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,660
for them so

348
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,180
you're you're just part of a witness to

349
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,760
the things I give to them okay so I'm

350
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,079
not trying to sell nothing I'm not

351
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:43,920
trying to put something out there

352
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,459
eventually have a you know a a fund I've

353
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,660
asked I've been asked about that too am

354
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,040
I going to eventually try to pull

355
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,079
people's money and and trade for a fee I

356
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,220
don't want any of that stuff I don't

357
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,040
want any of that okay so I enjoy doing

358
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,639
this but I don't want it to be

359
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,019
misrepresented by some

360
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,820
goofballs that think they know something

361
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,200
they don't and all the while they're

362
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
over here trying to sell my stuff and

363
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,720
relabeling it themselves Okay so

364
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,160
ICT order blocks are completely specific

365
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,579
levels okay they're not ambiguous zones

366
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,100
and when I shared that link excuse me

367
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,700
when I shared the link on Twitter it's

368
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,260
not a knock against Vic Noble okay

369
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,579
because Vic Noble's in business he's

370
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,500
trying to make money he's he's a he's an

371
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,240
instruction instructor educator whatever

372
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,100
it is okay

373
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,220
but the guy that he's backing now is

374
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,779
saying that he worked for a bank and he

375
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,339
made the software program for the bank

376
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,959
and I'm calling right away on

377
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,060
that okay first of all you're not you're

378
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,100
not the one doing it okay you aren't the

379
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
one doing that secondly you aren't the

380
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,899
one okay

381
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,820
showing real

382
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,680
institutional order flow

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,279
or quote-unquote banking levels on an

384
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,380
mt4 platform like that video suggests

385
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,940
and I'll I'll tell you what I mean by

386
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,959
that

387
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,600
when when they draw a level and this is

388
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,579
synonymous with supply and demand as

389
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,380
well and again don't take my word for

390
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,600
this go and look at this stuff okay so

391
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,360
when we see ideas like this this is

392
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,100
resistance obviously we know that

393
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,959
because price went up there and rejected

394
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,240
it okay and that's given no problem you

395
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,380
have no problem understanding that

396
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,360
everyone understands that

397
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,300
what leads to this level becoming a

398
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,339
resistance level before it gets there

399
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,560
and trades there it's completely utterly

400
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,079
independent from looking at it like we

401
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,180
do in textbooks or Educators telling us

402
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,000
this was resistance okay

403
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,220
the fallacy with Educators and gurus

404
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,899
okay and honestly a lot of my

405
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,560
subscribers fall into this group okay

406
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,940
they will hear me speak they'll hear me

407
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,740
talk they'll see examples of my videos

408
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,380
and I do a lot of lipstick and window

409
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,000
dressing with my presentations because

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
it's my personality you don't you may

411
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
not like Deadpool you may not like

412
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,120
sniper stuff you may not like some of

413
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,680
the things I say you may not like when I

414
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
occasionally drop a a swear word and

415
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,220
you're going to send me an email and

416
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,320
tell me I shouldn't talk like that I'm

417
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,079
real okay I'm not trying to be anything

418
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,620
but who I really am and I sometimes show

419
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,279
my real personality and I try to be as

420
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,040
uh you know cordial and respectful as I

421
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,540
possibly can but sometimes it just you

422
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,560
know you gotta get a little real world

423
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,300
sometimes and and Shake Somebody by the

424
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,260
lapels

425
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,000
but when you look at things

426
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and you study price action

427
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,519
you have to know before it becomes

428
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,620
resistance otherwise it's going to be of

429
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,899
no use to you okay you have to have an

430
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,079
idea an idea rather or mindset going

431
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
into that price level that it should

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,579
offer a resistance level otherwise

433
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,100
what use is it to you you're going to be

434
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,300
able to point out on the other side of

435
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,560
your chart like we're doing here and

436
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,959
saying look here's resistance well Trade

437
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:52,620
It

438
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,420
can you go back there and trade that no

439
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,339
you can't okay it's already passed it's

440
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,720
a missed opportunity

441
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
but

442
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,980
supply and demand will teach you

443
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,199
that okay well there's a supply level up

444
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,679
in here okay there's a supply level and

445
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,359
it creates a Zone

446
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,059
and they'll draw all these boxes and

447
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,959
rectangles which will look by the first

448
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,699
introduction to it like an ICT order

449
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,760
block or an area which I highlight okay

450
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,220
where we move back into a up or down

451
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,959
candle and that's not the same thing

452
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,840
okay and believe me we're not arguing

453
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,299
semantics here it's very specific when

454
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,280
we look at

455
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,220
the mean threshold okay the middle of an

456
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,480
up candle

457
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,640
the body of the up candle that's the

458
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,380
level at which the institutions are

459
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,140
going to be trading at many times okay

460
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,299
that's the highest point it'll go

461
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,320
let me zoom in here

462
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,600
and let's take this

463
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,380
off

464
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
you guys you can hear my puppy snoring

465
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,520
but just deal with it so um we have

466
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,900
this up candle in here

467
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,660
and what we do is we measure the body of

468
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,520
the candle right in here okay now

469
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,220
an up candle prior to a down price leg

470
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,860
okay or swing away from a level like

471
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,240
this this is very easily concerned

472
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,980
because we see a very significant price

473
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,419
move away from it

474
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,940
the up candle is where the institutions

475
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,039
have to sell into that and this is all

476
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,620
rehash we all know this okay but I

477
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,580
really want to draw a distinction

478
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,980
between this because I still see this

479
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,200
stuff popping up and because it's fresh

480
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,760
today on Twitter I just want to rub

481
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,360
their nose in it the

482
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,940
the body of the candle here okay all

483
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,760
this movement up right into this move

484
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160
higher that high creates the resistance

485
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,200
level that's the high of the price swing

486
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
okay or the swing High okay when we see

487
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,880
that

488
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,840
think about it you work for UBS okay you

489
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,260
are trying to get out of a price move

490
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,200
that you are trying to take profits on

491
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,059
okay you're a bank Trader your your job

492
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,740
is the speculation side of things you're

493
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,020
not in the business uh transactional

494
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,880
side of the bank you're actually in

495
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
there doing speculation and yes there

496
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
are uh Traders

497
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,700
let me get my get myself comfortable

498
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,919
here the uh there are traders in the

499
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,780
bank level that speculate for Pure

500
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,360
profit now it's not a large

501
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,980
um uh

502
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,160
openly discussed topic okay and some of

503
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,900
them will say well there's really very

504
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,059
little uh speculation in the banking

505
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,100
level and that's because they aren't

506
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,020
privy to it okay

507
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,179
that's the area I came from

508
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,880
that's the area okay or field that I

509
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,679
came from okay that's the area they

510
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,740
wanted me in okay and my my

511
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,580
idea was well if I'm learning how to do

512
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,160
this why would I want to work for anyone

513
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,020
else I could just do this on my own and

514
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,280
I left with a great deal of

515
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
animosity placed on me and it's still it

516
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,660
still follows me today but nonetheless

517
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,940
the bank has to unload that as the price

518
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
is moving up it cannot do it effectively

519
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,120
as it's starting to move away because

520
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,120
they don't get the

521
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,179
efficient uh exit points

522
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,460
for their potential uh profits because

523
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,179
their size of Trades are so large now

524
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,340
they're not in there leveraging 50 to

525
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,620
100 to 1 400 to one they're not doing

526
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,080
those types of things but their scale is

527
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,700
very large and they have to have

528
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,080
counterparties to the other side of that

529
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,700
so because they're trading on an inner

530
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,720
Bank level they have to find

531
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,620
counterparties of equal or greater uh

532
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,100
size to eat into that move so and then

533
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,940
we're not going to be talking about

534
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,640
pancakes so

535
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,919
the uh the up move in here okay this

536
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,100
candle is where all the selling is done

537
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,660
when you look at supply and demand

538
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,460
they'll say well look at this down

539
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,960
candle here there was some Supply here

540
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,900
they sold all here okay and they'll draw

541
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,940
your attention to this candle

542
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,919
or this area up in here and they'll draw

543
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,539
a rectangle around and they'll spend a

544
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,000
whole lot of time with the upper side

545
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,179
of the uh of the range okay or Zone

546
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,400
and that much like I've said in the past

547
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,500
about Ninja Traders uh quote-unquote

548
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
Dynamic support and resistance which is

549
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,240
a load of that really

550
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,860
as soon as I hear stuff like as soon as

551
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,480
I see things like that I already know

552
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,520
right away they have no idea what

553
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,140
they're talking about and I want you to

554
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,720
do the same thing okay because unless

555
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
you are anticipating a turtle soup

556
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,919
environment okay or false breakout type

557
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,840
thing okay

558
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,960
this idea won't hold water it won't work

559
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,000
okay it won't work

560
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,520
so and I'll explain what I mean by that

561
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,320
so I know some of you are questioning

562
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,299
what you know can you explain that I'm

563
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,440
going to just let me get through the

564
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,720
thought process please so the up candles

565
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,120
what we look at now because they have

566
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,700
they are selling into this move up

567
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,860
your eye your your eye needs to be

568
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,200
trained in okay well they started the

569
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,720
price move up in here okay so they're

570
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,360
selling all in this big bullish candle

571
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,840
so in this big bullish candle in here

572
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,299
the likelihood of them getting out from

573
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,159
the middle of the range of the candle up

574
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,980
to the uh the close of the or the the

575
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,020
bulk of the body here and let's

576
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,059
highlight that so you can see what I'm

577
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,419
talking about

578
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,140
the likelihood

579
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,980
of price

580
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,100
right in here

581
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,500
and we'll stick with orange that's good

582
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,900
the likelihood of price getting back

583
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,080
into this side of the body of the candle

584
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,820
and up to the high

585
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,780
is very very slim now I know what you're

586
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,980
seeing you're seeing the same thing I'm

587
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,299
seeing it well it did it over here yeah

588
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,860
it did there's going to be a few times

589
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,200
where it does that and that's where the

590
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,780
hook comes in for supply and demand

591
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,400
Traders will say well see this is right

592
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,960
here it went right back up into this

593
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,240
Zone and there's your cell and that's

594
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,640
great that's wonderful wonderful

595
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,460
one-time example

596
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,220
you have to idea anymore so you have to

597
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,020
subscribe to the idea that that's not

598
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,760
always going to happen

599
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,539
so my work was okay when the banks okay

600
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,880
are selling into this they're trying to

601
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,980
get specific price levels

602
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,720
they're not just selling just throwing

603
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,100
it out there and hoping someone you know

604
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,919
they're looking for counterparties okay

605
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,840
and they're very easily discerned in the

606
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,340
marketplace on the inner Bank level

607
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,960
they're common knowledge actually

608
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
because the banks are out there saying

609
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,140
look you know I need to move 200 million

610
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,299
I need to move you know a half a billion

611
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,860
dollars I need to move a billion dollars

612
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,659
I need to get this you know I need to

613
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,240
get this transacted so when you see that

614
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,280
on the institutional level what you

615
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,500
can't see you can't see it on mt4 you

616
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
can't see it on Market profile you can't

617
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
you can't see all that kind of stuff you

618
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
know it's completely outside of the

619
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,179
scope of what we can see on a retail

620
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,640
level you have to be in that environment

621
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,919
to see it you got to be elbows to elbows

622
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,539
with it okay and that's some of the

623
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,179
things there's a barrier for people like

624
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,640
myself that have had the experience have

625
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,679
seen it okay and I had to bridge that

626
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,960
understanding through what I see in

627
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,059
price action is it something that can be

628
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,520
seen repeating in a chart because if you

629
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,679
can see it in a chart the concept is

630
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
conceptualized and then you can pass it

631
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,640
on like I want to pass on on my children

632
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,380
so

633
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,299
what my work

634
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,360
was and this is all me this is not

635
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
someone else's rehash stuff I didn't

636
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,900
find this somewhere else okay but you're

637
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,240
seeing it all now I'm sharing the links

638
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,039
when I see my stuff pop up or if they

639
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,140
even hint to it I show it out there I

640
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,120
give it now if I'm trying to copy

641
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,640
somebody people that copy stuff don't

642
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,159
take you to other sources of it they

643
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,720
want to deny it or they want to hide

644
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
from it I will show you other people are

645
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,100
taking my things okay they're doing that

646
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,380
and they're selling it now my question

647
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,600
is why don't they just trade it just

648
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,100
trade it you'll make more money you

649
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,120
don't have to worry about subscribers

650
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,080
you don't have to worry about Services

651
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
you don't have to worry about any of

652
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,919
that horseshit make your own money you

653
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,659
can write your own check there's no

654
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,580
reason why you can't do that so when I

655
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,960
see folks out there well you know I'll

656
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,520
you know I'll start my own signal

657
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
service I'm starting my own analysis

658
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,140
thing why are you even monkeying around

659
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,960
with that I've given you so much already

660
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,059
forget Market maker 12 for a minute and

661
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,980
yes we're gonna talk about that you have

662
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
so much given to you already there's no

663
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,880
reason why you guys aren't on the

664
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,580
pathway to completely just leaving your

665
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,440
your job doing what you got to do to

666
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,919
live your own life you have enough now

667
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
why are you even worried I'm telling you

668
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,779
I did that stuff 75 000 a month income I

669
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,240
was getting that I don't I don't want it

670
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,580
I don't miss it I don't need that and

671
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,220
believe me if you are confident to the

672
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,419
degree where you want to teach other

673
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,220
people then you sure as hell I better be

674
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,440
confident trade your money if you're not

675
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,000
there's a problem

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,760
if you're selling it

677
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,980
that begs the question why are you

678
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,440
selling it that's a tiny little pissant

679
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,000
amount of money

680
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,120
it's a small little insignificant grain

681
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,860
of what's potentially available to you

682
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,600
as a Trader understanding the stuff I

683
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,799
teach

684
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,020
why are you selling it

685
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,600
seriously you know who you are there's a

686
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,299
couple of you and

687
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,320

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,380
well you know this and that dude forget

689
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,880
about it okay if you're going to judge

690
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,620
this on my FX book that's ain't done

drawdown I waited and I'm waited I

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,320
of three and a half percent and look it

702
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,500

inside of six months and here's the

710
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,100
kicker it's going to be a million

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
dollars for the end of the year so kiss

712
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,600
my ass on that one so getting back to

713
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,679
this

714
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,440
the up candle is where they sell so my

715
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
idea was okay well how do I how do I get

716
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,659
to drawing out the uh the selling that

717
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:34,919
they're really trying to get in here all

718
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,320
the uh the movement past the halfway

719
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,679
point of that candle this is all stops

720
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,720
this is all stops

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
this liquidity is reaching up air

722
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,380
expanding for the liquidity what's it

723
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,880
reaching for well look right next to it

724
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,380
see these two candles

725
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,960
this is down candle that down candle

726
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,220
folks are going to say good well it's

727
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,380
going to go down so let's put our stop

728
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,320
loss right above that level that high

729
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
so that's the reason why it expands and

730
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,240
snags that and takes them out the

731
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,220
institutions are not selling the largest

732
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,720
portion up here

733
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,000
they may get another portion of it out

734
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,679
with the liquidity offered to the left

735
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,700
over here

736
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,440
but by far and large you're going to see

737
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,559
that it's the low of the up candle to

738
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,360
the halfway point of the body of the

739
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,320
candle

740
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,559
that's the bulk of the volume okay so

741
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,179
now while we brought up volume

742
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,679
um I understand that the Foreign

743
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,539
Exchange Market is not a centralized

744
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,400
exchange and I think everyone else

745
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,980
trading it knows that too

746
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,200
um it's an electronic medium that you're

747
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,960
trading through your independent uh pool

748
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,360
of liquidity that your your broker

749
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,820
offers okay and

750
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,220
I came from Trading Futures so coming on

751
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,720
Twitter to try to tell me how to do it

752
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,460
with a monkey mask on is a little

753
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,500
ludicrous okay I've made millions of

754
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,419
dollars trading the commodity markets

755
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,400
and while you're scraping around looking

756
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,260
for slings to make yourself look funny

757
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,260
on Twitter I've already walked you okay

758
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,480
so I know more about the Futures Market

759
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,220
than I've shared with the Foreign

760
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,840
Exchange Market I cut my teeth on

761
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,360
Commodities okay and I can tell you that

762
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,159
the Foreign Exchange Market is by far

763
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,620
and large well beyond the Futures Market

764
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,380
way way better and if it was not the

765
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,960
case I'd still be trading commodities I

766
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,820
don't trade Commodities I have not

767
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,799
traded Commodities in a number of years

768
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,320
okay I don't trade bonds anymore I don't

769
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,140
trade S P 500 I don't trade yes I don't

770
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,200
trade uh gold I don't trade silver I

771
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,340
don't trade any of the metals I don't

772
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,840
trade any agricultural markets I don't

773
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,100
trade the sauce I don't do any of those

774
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,220
things anymore I found what I love and

775
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,580
it's the spot Market okay it's so liquid

776
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,039
and you guys just see what I talk about

777
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,140
in the retail World okay I have Prime

778
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,240
brokerage accounts where I'm Trading

779
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,580
cash level because there's no leverage I

780
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,620
trade millions of dollars

781
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,260
in a bank level I don't do any

782
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,340
leveraging

783
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,620
but I make so much doing that I don't

784
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,000
need to do anything else and it's so

785
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,980
liquid I can choose whether or not I

786
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,480
want the price that's offered to me can

787
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,100
you do that with your broker once you're

788
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,480
filled gets your price

789
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,279
I have an option do I want that price or

790
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,539
not

791
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,120
there's benefits to that okay and you

792
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,679
got you got a little bit of time to do

793
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,240
it you can call up and come back say

794
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,860
look you know yeah I don't want that

795
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,000
quote

796
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,799
try doing that in your retail world you

797
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,840
can't do that and again these are all

798
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,220
 that get on here and they think

799
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,960
they know something and you're going to

800
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,059
try to call somebody out dude you have

801
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,179
no idea who I am you have no idea who I

802
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,039
am the only thing I've shared with you

803
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,020
is what I'm willing to share with you

804
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,440
but I've shared enough to know what I

805
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,919
teach and share makes tons and tons of

806
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,840
money okay I'm not trying to teach

807
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,700
people to be materialistic I'm not

808
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,919
trying to be uh an educator that uh

809
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,140
promotes egotism okay and you're hearing

810
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,820
a little bit of mine today and I'm

811
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,320
letting it come out but believe me I'm

812
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,059
thralling back because I could really

813
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,520
really do a whole lot more than this and

814
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
you probably are laughing you're

815
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,740
probably Snicker and saying well you

816
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,179
know look at him I got him you don't got

817
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,120
me you you do not got me I'm sitting on

818
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,740
my couch buddy you're at work

819
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,140
you're at work stealing time when your

820
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,940
boss is uh internet okay that's what

821
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,620
you're doing I'm sitting here on my

822
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,200
recliner okay relaxing talking to you

823
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,779
Schmucks okay not to not the subscribers

824
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,299
that I invest my time in but the goobers

825
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm referring to right now you know

826
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,240
exactly who you are

827
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,279
Okay so

828
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,899
when you look at my things understand

829
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,700
there's a distinction between supply and

830
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,659
demand

831
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,419
and ICT order blocks the ICT order block

832
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,600
is this level right here the bottom of

833
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,399
this orange candle I'm sorry orange

834
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,140
range in here to this

835
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,419
the right there is the ICT order block

836
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:49,799
right in there

837
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,860
okay that's what you want to look for

838
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,260
and that's where the banks are trading

839
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,120
it's the low of the up candle product of

840
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
the down move up to the middle of the

841
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
range the mean threshold okay that's the

842
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,179
Midway Point anything above that is too

843
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,039
thin of liquidity

844
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
it's too thin

845
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,820
you're not likely to get that

846
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,000
but you have a 90 likelihood it's going

847
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,679
to trade into that right here between

848
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,140
the middle middle of the range down to

849
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,140
the low many times the trade occurs

850
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,539
right at the low

851
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,779
think about that okay so in your notes

852
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,940
if you haven't already established this

853
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,100
uh understanding that's really where

854
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,480
you're supposed to be at

855
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,940
now the question is is when you have

856
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,159
that information

857
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,640
let's contrast the two things here

858
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
and what I'm doing is I'm the

859
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,640
equilibrium line here that's the 50

860
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,039
level on the FIB I just highlighted what

861
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,440
I view it as I don't like FIB levels at

862
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,600
50 like some Educators use it like it's

863
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,520
a real meaningful thing I use it

864
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,520
conceptionally to illustrate where

865
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,179
um fair value is and a like this mean

866
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,320
threshold where it's the middle of the

867
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,080
range of a up candle for order block

868
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,059
this is the area at which we highlight

869
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,919
for an ICT order block okay this is not

870
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,220
supply this is an ICT order block so

871
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,919
inside of this area okay what we do is

872
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,640
we

873
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,100
look at the highest point and the lowest

874
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,779
point of

875
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,380
the block

876
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,419
oh I grabbed the wrong thing

877
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,840
okay so now we have

878
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,840
a range of

879
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,279
99.63 and 99.15 now it may be a little

880
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,260
bit off that but right now it's it's

881
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,460
going to accomplish the method

882
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,980
nonetheless my question is this so

883
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,419
between 99

884
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,399
.63 and 99.15 what institutional levels

885
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,340
reside within that level or inside that

886
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,179
range

887
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,639
okay because now we're going to talk

888
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,179
in similar vernacular as it relates to

889
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,159
supply and demand up to this point this

890
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,139
is where the distinction uh is

891
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,580
established there's a leap into well

892
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,639
well beyond the level of vagueness

893
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,560
that's shared in supply and demand to

894
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,418
now specific price levels we're going to

895
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,639
get very very specific right now okay

896
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,080
because the banks are not out there

897
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,520
guessing well I hope there's somebody

898
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,260
out there in this Zone that'll trade

899
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,760
with me I hope there's somebody out here

900
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,119
in this big vast range of uh you know

901
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,179
opportunity okay they have a specific

902
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,820
level in mind okay and knowing these

903
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,639
levels okay is a phenomenon it repeats

904
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,780
over and over again it doesn't change

905
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,580
this process is the same every single

906
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,440
time it doesn't make a difference what

907
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,540
time frame you're looking at okay but

908
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,639
obviously the larger the time frame the

909
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,960
better because the banks are not trading

910
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,040
on five minute charts and one minute

911
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
charts and tick charts and 15 minute

912
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,700
charts that's not what they're trading

913
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,400
off of you as a retail Trader can see

914
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,700
the order flow coming into the market

915
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,339
on a smaller time frame a little bit

916
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,400
more detailed but it's not them looking

917
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,839
at these smaller time frames and saying

918
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,980
well there's a level here on this five

919
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,380
minute chart I'm going to trade on that

920
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,520
all the things you see on a five minute

921
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,619
chart and 15 minute chart an hourly

922
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,640
chart

923
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,820
they're all subordinate okay to what you

924
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,520
see on a monthly weekly daily and at the

925
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,800
very least the four hour chart and I'm

926
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,920
going to say four hour chart with

927
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,880
tongue-in-cheek because the majority of

928
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,359
it's always on the daily chart Okay so

929
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,339
between 99.63 99.15 okay when you look

930
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:47,040
for is you want to see what levels

931
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,460
are residing inside of

932
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,220
these two price points okay and we'd

933
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,040
like to use round numbers

934
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,980
starting with the 80s

935
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,300
50s

936
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,180
20s and round again so you have a full

937
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,760
figure mid figure the 80s and the 20s

938
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,000
okay so we have

939
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,220
without a doubt 50

940
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,180
is definitely one to be uh

941
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,160
considering

942
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,380
and because I have this little go to

943
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,240
webinar thing on the right hand side I

944
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
have to

945
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,880
do it like this I apologize

946
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,579
and I just mess it up how about that see

947
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,119
what I can do

948
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,940
all right I'm going to stay away from

949
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,400
that level all right so the institution

950
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,220
level or mid figure 99.50 okay that's

951
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,200
the level that you would go to

952
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
immediately that's the first one you go

953
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,060
to okay and you can fine tune an 80 well

954
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,040
we're outside of the range because we

955
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,140
didn't get to 80 did we the upper part

956
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,839
of the boundary of this up candle

957
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,880
80 would be up here somewhere

958
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,220
so we can't we can't incorporate the 80

959
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,520
level okay the other level that would be

960
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
um

961
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,700
potentially uh

962
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,980
available to us for a trade setup

963
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,619
is the 20 level

964
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,780
and I'll go into more detail again why

965
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,040
we're pulling this actually I know I

966
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,940
know there's a couple of you in here

967
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,220
that have no business being in a level

968
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,440
of Education like this without having

969
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,579
gone through all the other stuff because

970
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,079
I see some of you asking what's an order

971
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:25,920
block

972
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,300
so here's the uh 20 Level the 99-20

973
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,359
institutional and then you have the

974
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,920
99.50 okay now I'm going to take a step

975
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,720
back I'm not going to spend a whole lot

976
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,280
of time with this but I just want you to

977
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,900
look at this for a second and you tell

978
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,359
me if anything jumps off the chart based

979
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,079
on what I just showed you

980
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,420
[Music]

981
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,560
cue the Jeopardy music

982
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,700
clearly the 9950 level okay do you see

983
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,339
how price kept

984
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,940
the bodies right and subject to the mid

985
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,540
figure you see that now

986
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,119
you see a wick that goes up a little bit

987
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,880
deeper past the mean threshold and

988
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,920
that's sometimes going to happen it does

989
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,119
it again in here goes a little bit

990
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,880
deeper and sometimes that'll happen

991
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,160
it does it again here and yes sometimes

992
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,619
that'll happen but the bulk of the

993
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,599
volume is always in the bodies of the

994
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,579
candle and look at the bodies of the

995
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,140
candle see that

996
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,359
it's this is the level they're trading

997
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,940
at they may have reached price up in

998
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,859
here they may have offered a smaller

999
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:38,040
block of orders to spread the price up

1000
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,220
to Once once there's a trade at a price

1001
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,400
level everything below it

1002
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
is now I they're active in other words

1003
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,240
they're pressing limit orders in a range

1004
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,460
between like say where this candle opens

1005
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,220
up okay if it trades up to here

1006
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,680
everything from that high

1007
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,420
to this previous candle if it was a

1008
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,160
limit order in there it's all now become

1009
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,599
a market order

1010
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,579
now based on what those orders are

1011
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,640
whether it being buy orders or sellers

1012
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,440
is the the basis of how the liquidity is

1013
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,660
being introduced to the marketplace so

1014
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
if we understand that the backdrop is

1015
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,859
over here that they sold it as a

1016
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,420
resistance for whatever reason we know

1017
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,500
what's the resistance because price

1018
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,960
moves a significant level away from it

1019
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,420
then it came back into it okay inside

1020
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,760
the orange area is where you're looking

1021
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,500
for your trade

1022
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,839
you're not worrying about a specific

1023
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,119
Zone you're looking for a specific level

1024
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,839
you're looking for specific

1025
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:35,820
Precision price points and we're looking

1026
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,460
at a daily chart here okay so if I go

1027
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,300
and I look at

1028
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,520
um

1029
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,380
it's not what I want to do

1030
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,859
and that's not what I'll do either let's

1031
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,040
see

1032
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,820
I knew I'd grab that thing and mess it

1033
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,940
up

1034
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,000
let's leave it in there so we don't mess

1035
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,619
them up and

1036
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,740
I get the date on when that actually

1037
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,240
traded into it

1038
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,000
all right so we traded into these levels

1039
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,420
on

1040
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,240
13th of April 2015.

1041
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,640
okay so we will

1042
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,460
drop down into I'm not sure if it'll

1043
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,200
give me it only it's dropped down to a

1044
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,500
four hour

1045
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,820
all right so here's that same price

1046
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,240
action

1047
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,200
foreign

1048
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,099
a four hour chart okay here's that first

1049
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,660
time it came up there and created the

1050
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,420
resistance level price moves away and it

1051
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,280
came all the way up into it okay now

1052
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,700
here's where the PHD level of ICT stuff

1053
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,920
comes in okay it's not enough simply

1054
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,200
looking at the levels and breaking it

1055
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,180
down it just draws your attention to

1056
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,560
where the trades are going to set up

1057
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,300
okay and it's going to be a deviation

1058
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,859
between

1059
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,380
um where you expect them to form and

1060
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,240
where they actually format okay and I

1061
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,099
think and I've done said this in the

1062
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,460
past a 15 pip variance between what you

1063
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,160
anticipate seeing happen and where it

1064
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,420
actually forms I think that's a

1065
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,520
realistic expectation okay especially if

1066
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,599
you understand how to do a top-down

1067
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,380
analysis what we're doing here okay now

1068
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,420
obviously we see price moving away in

1069
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,520
hindsight perfect we understand that we

1070
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,320
can't trade that but we have to learn

1071
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,720
from it we use these Concepts to build

1072
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,119
our understanding okay and understand

1073
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,700
there are specific price levels that we

1074
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,599
have to look for not zones okay so and

1075
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,180
again I understand some of you are

1076
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,400
saying well fine demand is an area that

1077
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,560
highlights zones and then you look for

1078
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,720
Price patterns okay great I understand

1079
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,820
that but

1080
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,579
you're not going to see Banks basing

1081
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,160
billions of dollars on

1082
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,780
animal patterns

1083
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,599
okay they're not looking at Price action

1084
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,400
thinking well that looks like a zebra

1085
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,119
pattern well there's a hunchback or a

1086
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,460
platypus and there's a you know there's

1087
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,740
a there's a blue thin crab and there's a

1088
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,160
there's a rockfish pattern here and you

1089
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,460
know look I've been there I've done it

1090
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,960
okay I know some of you can well you

1091
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,240
just don't know I did it I did it I

1092
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,060
traded I traded harmonic patterns okay

1093
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,000
quote unquote Advanced patterns there's

1094
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,740
nothing Advanced about that except for

1095
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,740
your Advanced waste of time okay you're

1096
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,720
you're attributing way too much credit

1097
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,740
to something that is really not doing

1098
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,540
anything for price

1099
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,640
harmonic patterns do not move price

1100
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,240
what'd I just say what did I just say

1101
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
it's Blasphemous I should have never

1102
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,540
said that

1103
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,099
I'll say it again

1104
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,460
harmonic patterns do not

1105
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,720
move

1106
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,940
price

1107
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,160
large Traders orders

1108
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,800
move price

1109
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,740
if you change the thought process when

1110
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,980
you view price action to understand

1111
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,480
where are those orders going to manifest

1112
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,560
and or where do these large orders

1113
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,980
materialize where are they resting where

1114
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,500
are they going to materialize

1115
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,060
where can they be taken in

1116
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,220
where will they be introduced

1117
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,240
it's as simple as that it's accumulation

1118
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,520
manipulation and distribution there is

1119
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,040
no Supply and there is no demand

1120
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,960
period

1121
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,000
I'll say it like this

1122
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,900
if this was Supply up here okay

1123
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,119
things can change on a fundamental basis

1124
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,700
I said that word again fundamental yeah

1125
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,380
I know there's something out there

1126
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,240
fundamentally driving the banks to do

1127
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
what they're doing but I'm never going

1128
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,020
to be online to be able to figure that

1129
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,800
out

1130
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,560
and neither will you on a very long-term

1131
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,900
macro scale yeah maybe based on interest

1132
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,339
rates and stuff like that but honestly

1133
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:34,020
just because you think you understand a

1134
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,900
fundamental uh premise behind it the

1135
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,339
bank can change their mind about the

1136
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,839
fundamentals

1137
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,660
just because employment numbers are a

1138
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,579
big deal now

1139
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,619
housing numbers may become a bigger deal

1140
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,900
later on

1141
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,520
manufacturing numbers may become it's

1142
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,380
always like a flavor of the month okay

1143
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,020
and it comes in in waves wherever the

1144
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,560
the Hot Topic is that's where the the

1145
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,839
the country's economies are going to be

1146
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,760
focused on and they're never always

1147
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,380
collectively worrying about one thing

1148
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,940
I'm sorry on all of them they're worried

1149
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,680
about one thing over the rest of them

1150
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,180
and you're always going to have medium

1151
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,400
impact and large impact drivers that

1152
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,319
come in the marketplace with news but

1153
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,359
you're never going to have this equal

1154
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,880
distribution of sensitivity amongst all

1155
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,680
of them there's going to be this

1156
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,700
gravitational attention placed more on

1157
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,220
one or maybe potentially two but

1158
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,079
generally it's one you'll find out by

1159
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,240
studying it all the major Market drivers

1160
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,839
for um uh every currency and government

1161
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,900
out there and and we trade they are

1162
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,960
highly sensitive to one over the rest

1163
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,540
okay and it like I said it always comes

1164
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,180
in that fad uh there's something that

1165
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,099
the countries are paying more attention

1166
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,400
to than the others amongst all the uh

1167
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,160
reports that come out

1168
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,140
so when we have

1169
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,380
this expectation as a retail Trader that

1170
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,780
fundamentals and Supply reside up here

1171
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,300
okay the banks can change the whole

1172
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,400
script and say well you know what

1173
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,560
um something is greater

1174
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,319
on the lower end of the market okay and

1175
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,660
those things won't ever become a factor

1176
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,579
to get back up here and trade it okay

1177
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,200
and by having the understanding of

1178
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,940
institutional order flow not supply and

1179
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,460
demand okay institutional order flow

1180
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,319
you'll be able to see

1181
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,720
that fundamentally they have changed

1182
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,460
gears so therefore price action will

1183
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,500
show you everything you need to know

1184
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,180
you're not trading fundamentals on a

1185
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,619
day-to-day basis you're not day trading

1186
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,540
fundamentals okay you're not short-term

1187
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,359
trading fundamentals now you can trade

1188
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,180
with a higher level long-term

1189
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,640
fundamental premise and only trade in

1190
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,900
that direction and that's no problem

1191
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,339
with that I have no argument with that

1192
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,900
you'll never hear me say anything about

1193
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,680
that

1194
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,780
but you're not going to convince me that

1195
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,339
you're trading on a day-by-day basis

1196
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,619
largely on fundamentals that you think

1197
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,060
are because I can show you reports

1198
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,640
that'll show uh what we viewed as

1199
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,800
bullish fundamentally and then there's

1200
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,480
15 other guys that we're saying with

1201
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,160
fundamentally it's bearish

1202
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,460
so again where do you go where is the

1203
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,339
pool that you're drinking from

1204
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:14,579
because it's all

1205
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:17,339
it is it all is because

1206
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:19,020
it's not a matter of what everyone

1207
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,339
thinks

1208
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,740
it's a matter of what they're doing

1209
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,660
I don't care what your opinion is in the

1210
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,160
marketplace and you shouldn't give a

1211
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,260
rats I ask what my opinion is either you

1212
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,359
don't care about what I think I'm

1213
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,099
telling you as the mentor in this whole

1214
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,800
show don't care about what I think about

1215
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,020
the market don't care about that you

1216
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,180
don't care about what ICT thinks about

1217
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,060
the cable the dollar the Fiverr the

1218
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,640
Aussie Mooney don't care about what I

1219
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,540
think

1220
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,579
that's the worst thing you could do as a

1221
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,500
Trader because what you're trying to do

1222
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,020
is you're trying to read my mind

1223
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,060
and you're not going to trust me it

1224
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,619
changes all the time it's changed 15

1225
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,599
times it's just in the presentation on

1226
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,640
this video alone I came in wanting to

1227
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,720
talk about something I'm already on 15

1228
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,240
different topics unfinished so looking

1229
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,980
at the you know when we look at

1230
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,660
fundamentals like that or levels like

1231
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,440
this implying Supply up here because the

1232
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,359
banks are the drivers okay because

1233
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,579
they're the big boys okay the retail

1234
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,099
world's not moving price they're you're

1235
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,480
trading inside of a little sandbox of

1236
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,240
liquidity the banks don't even see you

1237
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,280
they don't see you you're inside this

1238
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,700
little tiny little fxcm oh and the Forum

1239
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,240
okay of tiny little itty bitty liquidity

1240
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,160
Banks can't see that they don't see that

1241
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,780
but they know

1242
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,000
that everybody does the same thing place

1243
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,859
to stop above the old high place to stop

1244
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,079
below the old low that's what they

1245
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,760
that's what everyone's taught

1246
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,819
okay it's the same thing okay you want

1247
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,099
to know how accidents happen they cross

1248
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,660
the yellow line and they drive too fast

1249
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,640
it doesn't take a rock scientist to

1250
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,560
finish a fix you know to come to a

1251
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,780
conclusion that's how 90 of the uh the

1252
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,220
accents and fatalities occur when you're

1253
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,960
driving an automobile there's other

1254
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,460
things factors like drinking and driving

1255
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,079
and falling asleep at the wheel but

1256
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,880
they're small little you know not trying

1257
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,020
to minimize because I've had deaths in

1258
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,460
my family with a drunken drive but you

1259
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,599
know what I'm saying I mean there's

1260
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,420
other caveats that lead to accidents

1261
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,339
well there's other caveats that leads to

1262
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,960
profitability and unprofitability in

1263
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,839
trading but by far and large okay it's

1264
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,700
the fact that they have a stop loss

1265
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,220
available which is begging for liquidity

1266
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,220
to be absorbed that's a stop loss when

1267
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,720
you look at a stop loss and tell me if

1268
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,460
I'm wrong put a put a one if you agree

1269
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,900
in two if you don't in the room if

1270
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,280
you're if you're watching live right now

1271
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,780
obviously if you're watching recording

1272
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,160
you can't but

1273
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,880
if you have used a stop loss in the past

1274
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,980
do you view that stop loss as protection

1275
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,740
or do you view that stop loss as a

1276
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,099
bullseye one if you view this protection

1277
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:50,300
two is a bullseye

1278
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,740
exactly exactly so

1279
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,619
you're if I were to ask this question

1280
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,660
back in 2010

1281
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,220
all of you would say it's your

1282
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,560
protection it's your Shield okay and I

1283
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,420
will agree that is the only protection

1284
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,800
you have

1285
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,800
that's the only protection you have

1286
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,960
you cannot protect yourself any other

1287
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,520
way except or collapse the trade and

1288
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,380
remove yourself from the risk entirely

1289
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,540
but the only Shield you have in this

1290
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,060
business is the stop loss

1291
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,319
that's it

1292
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,119
there's no other defense mechanism out

1293
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:31,319
there except for what's between your

1294
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,300
ears

1295
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,579
but that's only useful when you put it

1296
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,160
into operation you can look at the chart

1297
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,020
and see it's going to take your stop out

1298
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,420
you can see that but you probably have

1299
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,859
been in this so many times where you see

1300
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,780
it happening you refuse to take the

1301
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,660
trade off and you take the full stop

1302
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,760
the market will take your full stop

1303
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,980
because you know you're looking at it

1304
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,059
and you said okay well it's not going to

1305
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,020
get there it's not going to get there I

1306
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,640
hope it doesn't get there but if it does

1307
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,619
at least I'm protective but you know

1308
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,559
then what's happening is it's your mind

1309
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,540
has a paradigm shift and it now becomes

1310
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,440
what it's not a shield it's a bullseye

1311
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,079
well Banks don't trade with stop loss

1312
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,520
orders

1313
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,079
and that's probably surprising to a lot

1314
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,760
of you but they don't

1315
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,559
they don't need to their pockets are

1316
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,079
very very deep Okay so

1317
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,579
when

1318
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,059
Traders and fund managers okay are

1319
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,920
speculating and they put a stop loss

1320
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,380
order in there that is the very thing

1321
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,599
that you're looking for when I jokingly

1322
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,700
say when you're a new Trader or your

1323
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,380
novice Trader a newbie and you sit down

1324
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,059
with the price action that you're you're

1325
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,339
studying okay and you're hoping to find

1326
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,940
a trade you're looking for a neon sign

1327
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,700
saying here I am okay the only neon sign

1328
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,660
that exists is stops

1329
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,660
that's it stop loss orders

1330
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,960
and I'll I'll give you a heads up that's

1331
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,220
largely what Market maker 12 is all

1332
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,200
about

1333
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,119
identifying that getting right to that

1334
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,920
because that's what the banks do now

1335
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,260
because they see the the literal orders

1336
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,880
in the marketplace they see the open

1337
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,920
interest that's available at those

1338
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,339
levels okay it's a different animal like

1339
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,319
we can see where they most likely will

1340
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,200
reside above or below an old high or low

1341
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,540
okay but

1342
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,300
they may not be there by the time price

1343
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,500
trades

1344
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,420
and that's what I'm about to explain

1345
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,800
here

1346
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,980
if you believe or subscribe to the idea

1347
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,380
that this is a supply level okay and

1348
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,780
let's go back and highlight that

1349
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,520
you know contrast it again when we get

1350
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,040
to it if you if you're viewing this

1351
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,720
whole thing up here

1352
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,819
from the high in the middle part of the

1353
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,740
range okay or

1354
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,660
really let's do it like this because

1355
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,640
this is what they would teach this is a

1356
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
supply level of it or Zone okay and

1357
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,460
price trades back up into that

1358
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,640
they will teach that there is

1359
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,260
a reason to believe it's going to go up

1360
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,240
to here when it's no reason to expect

1361
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,500
that at all

1362
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,480
it's the least likely occurrence to

1363
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,760
happen unless it's a turtle soup

1364
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,020
environment

1365
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,240
okay and

1366
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,800
because that topic is so vast and the

1367
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,480
parameters that go along with looking

1368
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,059
for turtle soup versus staying under a

1369
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:22,740
low and I know a lot of you ask that a

1370
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,020
lot okay and that's really Market MC12

1371
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,160
and the reason why I took a lot of

1372
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,460
things out of 12 and re redoing it okay

1373
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,859
there's 12 main things inside of Market

1374
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:38,220
maker 12. and I made I'm making rather I

1375
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,079
got two of them done two

1376
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,780
two specific of

1377
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,640
of

1378
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,040
a collection of points that I went in my

1379
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,780
opinion going back over looking at it I

1380
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,760
I brushed over it way too quickly and I

1381
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,680
was a lot more vulgar in the video than

1382
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,900
I probably should have been I kind of

1383
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,980
like warned some of you in the last

1384
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,780
video it was going to be very offensive

1385
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,579
because I was going after a lot of folks

1386
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,339
that have taken my stuff and and sold it

1387
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,859
um Steve Morrow and um

1388
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,859
really went after them so I I kind of

1389
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,800
like pulled myself back and and said

1390
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,059
okay well I'm going to deliver us a

1391
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:14,160
little bit more professional way

1392
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,660
um that way at least I can close this

1393
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,640
circus in uh you know a better light

1394
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,260
than uh I would have if I did it that

1395
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,280
way because I was kind of like kicking

1396
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,780
them in the balls and anyone watching

1397
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,940
that video would have been like wow wow

1398
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,240
it would have been totally shocking but

1399
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,180
um I I think that I'm doing it better by

1400
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,700
doing it this way and that way it's a

1401
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,140
little bit more modular so underneath

1402
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,059
the link of Market maker 12. you're

1403
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,180
actually going to see 12 subordinate

1404
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,040
hyperlinks okay so it won't be marked

1405
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,300
like a 12 click on it there it is it's

1406
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,520
gonna be mockery 12 as a header and then

1407
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,440
it's gonna be 12 individual links inside

1408
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,240
of that so it kind of like breaks it

1409
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,319
down

1410
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,880
um I don't know how long it's going to

1411
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,260
take me to go into it because like I

1412
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,420
said I only got a couple of them done so

1413
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,859
and no I'm not going to give them to you

1414
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,740
until they're all done so deal with it

1415
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,640
and I don't know how long it's going to

1416
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,000
be so there you go the uh the idea of

1417
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,559
this level being up here being a supply

1418
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,900
level and fundamentals up there driving

1419
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,119
it uh lower uh the fundamentals can

1420
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040
change by the time it gets to this point

1421
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,859
here and it never gets up to that level

1422
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,859
okay or it could trade up in there and

1423
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,079
cause really no selling it could just

1424
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:20,460
continue blowing right on through it

1425
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,160
okay so again it's not you're not

1426
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,440
getting to the the end of the game

1427
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,420
with fundamentals

1428
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,819
okay and there's a lot of folks that are

1429
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:32,700
just looking at um a lot of online

1430
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,000
marketing that's going on

1431
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,180
Jared Davis is uh

1432
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,819
ran with Chris Laurie's work

1433
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,200
and that's really where he got his stuff

1434
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,819
from he's full of telling you

1435
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:46,380
anything otherwise

1436
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,260
um the the guy's not self-taught he's

1437
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,079
Forex Mentor okay he's Vic Noble's uh

1438
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,599
new student and he did something with

1439
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,819
some guy named Andrew Jenkin it was a

1440
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,800
failed operation there too I bought a

1441
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,480
couple of his courses and all it was was

1442
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,920
pivots and Fibonacci and absolutely

1443
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,020
nothing Market flow which it's all Nick

1444
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,819
Noble stuff okay and again I'm not

1445
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,980
trying to smack Nick Noble around but

1446
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,079
um Jared Davis has got this big online

1447
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,000
campaign right now that he's the second

1448
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,660
uh top rated uh Trader rated by Barclays

1449
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,859
and then Barclays stomped him in his

1450
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,599
face and said don't you uh don't you use

1451
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,480
us you know attributing us to uh you

1452
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,079
know your work or whatever but um look

1453
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,000
if the fundamentals if you want to learn

1454
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,460
fundamentals the right way and a whole

1455
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,520
lot cheaper and I believe what is being

1456
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,859
shared is effective go to

1457
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:40,460
chrislaurie.com okay or go to

1458
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,079

00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,599
Chris Laurie or tweet tweet him okay and

1460
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,980
just say hey look

1461
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,460
um ICT said that you have a course on

1462
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,000
fundamentals okay and buy it I think

1463
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,040
it's like 99 it's not even that much

1464
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,380
money but I I have openly said this in

1465
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,940
the past I don't get anything for it but

1466
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,059
I think he did an excellent job

1467
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:05,040
explaining fundamentals as it relates to

1468
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,339
trading especially currencies and it's

1469
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,420
useful

1470
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,900
um it's really how he was able to call

1471
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,760
in advance he's the only other one out

1472
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,740
there excited for myself that has called

1473
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,500
Canadian dollar higher long term you

1474
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,000
know I did videos I showed you by you

1475
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,980
know by levels but he goes into great

1476
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,720
detail and I'm not part of his Pro

1477
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,300
Traders Club to hear his uh his

1478
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,680
discussions as the you know all the

1479
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,079
other things going behind it but um

1480
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,540
I know that oil was going to be a large

1481
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,420
contributor to it and it was going to be

1482
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,099
a well and you know all that because of

1483
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:41,339
my conspiracy rants that I had uh you

1484
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,440
know two years ago and last year but the

1485
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,520
uh

1486
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,079
the fundamentals if you're going to do

1487
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,880
that save yourself thousands of dollars

1488
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,520
and wasted time okay and just simply go

1489
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,900
to Chris Laurie and he'll teach

1490
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,119
everything that I personally believe if

1491
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,819
you want if you want a a sponsor okay if

1492
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:59,339
you want to uh like a

1493
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,740
um advertisement for you know something

1494
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,200
to spend money on that's the one you buy

1495
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,359
okay uh I think he did an excellent job

1496
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,339
again it's Chris Laurie you go and uh

1497
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:09,960
just simply get it and study it you're

1498
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,859
not going to get it all one time

1499
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:12,119
watching it you know I certainly

1500
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,520
couldn't do it um and

1501
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,099
I believe it was well well presented and

1502
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:19,440
it's good so there you go

1503
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,260
so uh you're welcome Chris

1504
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,140
uh looking at the the idea behind it

1505
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,319
though um fundamentals um relating on a

1506
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,300
day trade short-term basis again I don't

1507
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,400
believe it as any Merit unless you're

1508
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,099
trading with the long-term fundamental

1509
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,319
basis okay it's bullish embarrassing

1510
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,099
you're only trading in that direction

1511
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,319
then yeah but uh if you think you're

1512
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,400
gonna swing back and forth on

1513
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,020
fundamentals you're kidding yourself

1514
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,280
you're certainly not going to sell that

1515
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,819
idea to me and believe it so

1516
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:50,579
the the idea is when we look at these

1517
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,380
areas okay and now I'm highlighting what

1518
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,339
I believe is the hang on puppy because

1519
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,440
she's now snoring way too loud

1520
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,140
Bella Bell

1521
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,760
you're too loud girl

1522
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,559
so uh

1523
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,059
again these are all the things you don't

1524
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:08,220
get to hear in my pre-recorded stuff so

1525
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,140
there's a lot of editing

1526
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,740
the rough cut so

1527
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,160
this move above the ICT order Block in

1528
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,339
here okay we reduced it down to two

1529
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,079
specific price levels

1530
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,760
based on the daily chart and this is

1531
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,799
what you do this is how you incorporate

1532
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:28,020
all the things that I teach over the

1533
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,079
last five plus years okay the the brass

1534
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,180
taxes this identify where there's a

1535
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,520
likely

1536
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,980
resistance and and price okay or where

1537
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,420
selling should come in

1538
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,740
and where the banks are going to be

1539
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,299
trading at and how they're going to be

1540
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:43,440
trading what they're going to be selling

1541
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,260
them because they sold it here and where

1542
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,299
specifically should we be aiming to sell

1543
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:51,900
short well we label 9920 institutional

1544
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,280
level inside of the range that's

1545
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,020
discerned by the daily order block

1546
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,119
because we don't remember we dropped

1547
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,500
down to a four hour time frame right now

1548
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,400
so this range is highlighting the levels

1549
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,980
we look for inside that range we're not

1550
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,900
trade this for Zone sake okay we're

1551
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,480
looking for specific levels what levels

1552
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,140
institutional order levels 50s 20s 80s

1553
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,660
and full figures double O levels Okay

1554
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,540
the reason why we like those levels is

1555
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,980
because the banks trade with those

1556
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,660
levels they're not throwing out well I'm

1557
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,720
going to trade at 99.17 and let me get a

1558
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,040
selling at 99.23 that's not what they do

1559
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,900
they put their orders in in round

1560
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,020
numbers or in increments of five okay

1561
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,559
largely it's on on even numbers but some

1562
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:39,720
some banks will put their orders in on

1563
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,660
fives the bottom line is that's what

1564
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,680
you're going to see in the charts if you

1565
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,140
study it don't take my word for it

1566
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,460
so we know that 99.50 and 99 20

1567
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,220
and let's change these little

1568
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,619
things here just to highlight that being

1569
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,040
the case

1570
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:06,599
okay so we have these two levels here

1571
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,160
that we would almost automatically go

1572
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,780
into the marketplace looking for okay

1573
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,640
now again just so we're on the same

1574
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,559
topic uh and same page of this topic

1575
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,660
here as price trades up into these

1576
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,099
levels here that's when you'd be doing

1577
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:18,180
this obviously you can't do it in

1578
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,280
hindsight but in hindsight this is how

1579
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,540
you learn

1580
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,059
looking at it

1581
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,220
like this

1582
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,140
zoom in a little bit more

1583
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,720
so we have two price levels at which we

1584
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,660
would start Hawking setups now we went

1585
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,160
down from a daily chart to a four hour

1586
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,400
chart so the the next question is okay

1587
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,440
when price starts to trade off because

1588
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,000
the four hour chart is going to give you

1589
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,520
a whole lot of advance notice and I know

1590
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,260
a lot of you guys want to have that and

1591
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,599
need it okay and it's you know in my

1592
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,480
opinion it's something I should continue

1593
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,640
continuously advise you to do is trade

1594
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,960
on these higher time frames because it

1595
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,640
gives you

1596
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,980
the buffer that you need

1597
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,359
because if you're trying to trade on the

1598
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:01,799
five minute chart and 15 minute chart

1599
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,240
and sometimes really the even hourly

1600
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,420
chart um if wow that was good grief girl

1601
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,240
come here come on

1602
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,040
hey

1603
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,400
I saw him logs there girl wake up

1604
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,440
simply um

1605
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,299
when you see price turning like it does

1606
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:19,500
up here

1607
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,020
okay and starts to break down which is

1608
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,160
what you see

1609
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,760
here okay when you see that

1610
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,640
the next logical thing you would do is

1611
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,160
okay well what's the candle that it

1612
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,680
moved up from where's the low on it and

1613
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,200
where is the body of that candle

1614
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,640
same thing we just did on the daily

1615
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,680
chart okay is what we're going to do

1616
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,599
here it's the same premises all we're

1617
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:45,119
doing is top down analysis breaking it

1618
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,400
down and looking at the institutional

1619
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,400
order flow from the daily chart down to

1620
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,799
the four hour chart okay and again

1621
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,960
institutional order flow for those that

1622
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,440
wear monkey masks the

1623
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,780
idea is seen through price action okay

1624
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,380
and yes I'm completely aware that this

1625
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,000
MTV mt4 platform from Forex LTD okay has

1626
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,619
zero

1627
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,920
connection to the answer Bank levels

1628
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,900
that are available on the dollar

1629
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,280
I know that there's going to be

1630
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,900
disparity I've said this on record

1631
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,220
before but because you're going to be

1632
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,599
hit and miss and when you listen to me

1633
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,540
you don't have a full story but everyone

1634
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,119
knows in my work that I say that there's

1635
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,799
going to be a disparity between what the

1636
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,380
interbank pricing is on a particular

1637
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,319
currency versus what your platform is

1638
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,839
going to offer and thereby they're

1639
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:39,000
allowed to do that by law okay and your

1640
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,500
agreement there's going to be a

1641
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,440
disparity okay and it's well beyond the

1642
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,319
spread that they offer too

1643
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:48,180
and that's just all part of it guys I

1644
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,180
mean you can't escape that you you all

1645
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,819
signed on for that risk but when you see

1646
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:55,920
price from starting to move away okay

1647
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,839
starting to come down

1648
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,880
you start looking at levels that could

1649
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,380
potentially be

1650
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,780
New bearish Order blocks which is what

1651
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,640
this Orange area is highlighted on the

1652
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,440
daily chart it's the daily bearish order

1653
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,540
block ICT order block not supply Zone

1654
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,900
but ICD order block now since we have

1655
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,880
highlighted two specific price levels

1656
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,260
okay

1657
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,420
the next thing we would be doing is

1658
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,640
looking for on a smaller time frame in

1659
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,200
the four hour chart was there any

1660
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,299
indication this part start the breakdown

1661
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:27,059
okay once price trades up to these

1662
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:29,280
levels in here you got to be aware that

1663
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,339
these may be

1664
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:34,920
new smaller short term uh bear shorter

1665
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,319
blocks that could be utilized for trades

1666
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,540
price starts to trade up and starts to

1667
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,920
break down

1668
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,200
the up candle part of this drop down in

1669
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,559
this four hour candle you use the low

1670
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,260
to the body of the candle okay now again

1671
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,579
I'm going to use this opportunity

1672
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:52,740
because I get folks asking you to doing

1673
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,660
it now in the room

1674
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,180
how do I know when to use the bottom of

1675
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,280
the candle or the Wicks and the bodies

1676
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,880
of the candle okay and in your notebook

1677
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,740
I need you to write this underline it

1678
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,280
and highlight it okay the big big

1679
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,920
candles okay and when I say big candles

1680
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,440
think about what we talked about back in

1681
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,579
2010 on the baby pip States okay what I

1682
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,559
learned from Larry Williams was the

1683
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,040
markets trade in a rhythm it's small

1684
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,280
ranges and big ranges small ranges and

1685
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,380
big ranges okay

1686
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,420
a candle like this

1687
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,760
I would use the middle

1688
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,380
to the low

1689
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,020
not so much the body of the candle here

1690
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,299
and the low reason why because there's a

1691
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,619
whole lot more volume in here remember

1692
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:42,480
the body of the candle is where the

1693
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,160
majority of the ball the volume is for

1694
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,619
the buying and selling okay so when

1695
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,960
there's a smaller candle okay when

1696
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,480
there's a smaller candle I like to use

1697
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,880
the wick to the body of the candle for

1698
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,920
for Bare shorter blocks okay and we're

1699
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,839
going to highlight that here we have a

1700
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,700
small little body candle

1701
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,700
now I'm not going to use the 50 basis of

1702
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,559
that candle I'm going to elect to use

1703
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,579
the low

1704
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:07,440
to the body and yeah I know some of you

1705
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,819
pundits are saying well yeah because you

1706
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,460
can clearly see over here again this is

1707
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,900
the reason why I'm telling you this

1708
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,920
because I want you to go into your

1709
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,299
charts and you'll see this phenomenon

1710
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:18,180
taking place big candles Big Body

1711
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,319
candles okay you're going to use the 50

1712
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:23,700
of that body of the candle or the mean

1713
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,520
or the mean threshold okay that that

1714
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:31,740
Middle Point is about half of uh well it

1715
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,260
is a half but it's the it's the bulk of

1716
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,960
where all the uh institutional airflow

1717
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,240
is going to come in and I it'll be

1718
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,240
self-explanatory as I go

1719
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,319
looking at

1720
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,000
the up candle here

1721
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,799
using the body

1722
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:52,760
down to the low

1723
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,720
there's your institutional order block

1724
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:00,660
bearish not supply Zone okay Supply

1725
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,160
they'd have all kinds of business up

1726
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,140
here I'm highlighting we don't do that

1727
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,740
okay so inside of the range created here

1728
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,900
okay let's just borrow these

1729
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,099
there's that

1730
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,940
I knew I'd do that

1731
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,059
okay and

1732
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,640
I'm just going to put it on this side

1733
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,799
over here it's the same thing so we have

1734
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:53,900
uh

1735
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,980
99.72 and the bottom of it over here

1736
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,420
99.64. so my question is is what

1737
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,119
institutional level or levels

1738
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,039
exist between those two price points now

1739
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,380
yes it's a smaller little range but

1740
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,940
nonetheless the process is still the

1741
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:11,119
same

1742
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,579
we have

1743
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:16,319
99.70 round number well wait a minute

1744
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,299
Michael you didn't say 70 earlier yeah I

1745
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:20,279
know institutional levels are double O

1746
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:24,799
80s 50s 20s and back to double up

1747
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,259
smaller round numbers okay can be

1748
01:08:28,259 --> 01:08:30,719
utilized in between those other levels

1749
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,359
if there is a premise or Reason to use

1750
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,339
them which is what we've framed out here

1751
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:38,100
we already anticipated selling inside

1752
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,660
this range here

1753
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,219
price came up a little bit stabbed

1754
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:43,679
through it we allow for that and it

1755
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,020
starts to come back down the price comes

1756
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,759
back up into it we can look to be a

1757
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,979
seller again it's not going to based on

1758
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:51,600
what we identify as a bearish order

1759
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,238
Block it's not going to go to 99.80

1760
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,799
institutional

1761
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,660
likely not to do that let's just

1762
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,640
rephrase that

1763
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,440
based on the fact that 80 would be

1764
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:06,479
up here

1765
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,738
on the other side of the body of the

1766
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:09,179
candle which is not what we look for

1767
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:13,020
okay Supply would say look you know up

1768
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,880
here there's some Supply up here there's

1769
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,640
some flying this down candle okay so it

1770
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,259
could go up as high as this this candle

1771
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:20,880
here no it won't why would you expect

1772
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,399
that you know not on a consistent basis

1773
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,080
it's not going to do that

1774
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,359
now there's you're going to send me 20

1775
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,279
times this did it but I can send you

1776
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,620
thousands where it didn't

1777
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,299
so inside here we have 9970 and we have

1778
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:37,979
99.65 remember we they have to use five

1779
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,380
rounded to the five numbers okay now I

1780
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,819
know some of you also are thinking well

1781
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,979
it's what is it's going to be 70 it

1782
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,198
could be 65 it could be you know this

1783
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:47,880
that kind of thing you're only going to

1784
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,640
use the levels inside of the range okay

1785
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,380
this is the range that's identified for

1786
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,199
the ICT bearish order block okay so now

1787
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,040
what we just did was refined it down to

1788
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,520
99.70 you're going to sell at or

1789
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,620
99.65 the round number

1790
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,780
it doesn't get you can do 60 you can do

1791
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,520
60 because this is below the market okay

1792
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,199
and still very close to here there's

1793
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:11,820
nothing wrong with that either okay but

1794
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,800
if you want to be specific and follow

1795
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,280
the rules as I teach my children you

1796
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,600
would be trading at 99.65 or 99.70 or if

1797
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,400
you want to be a fancy dance and try to

1798
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,080
do like I do I want to make sure I try

1799
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,460
to get in the move I'm not trying to

1800
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,739
worry about 10 Pips I want to get in the

1801
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:31,080
in the trade as many times I don't get a

1802
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,719
trade because I insist on getting the

1803
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:36,600
very very best fill and I've done that

1804
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,400
well eight years ago I was really

1805
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,500
insisting on that and I missed a

1806
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,739
huge amount of spectacular entries that

1807
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,140
I just really pissed away by being too

1808
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,120
demanding on price action and I just

1809
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,560
missed them and some of you seen it last

1810
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,880
year and some of my trades when I did

1811
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,800
live sessions where I just missed it by

1812
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,020
a pip or two and some of them on X Okay

1813
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,920
so

1814
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,360
anyway uh looking at that

1815
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,800
let's leave those levels there I don't

1816
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,300
want to do that because we're going to

1817
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,679
refine it even more

1818
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,760
okay so we have price trading in

1819
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,480
at 99.70

1820
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,840
okay and it takes you right in here

1821
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,120
another high on these come in at 99.71

1822
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,900
good grief

1823
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:44,900
and 65 we'll look at that

1824
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,699
okay and clearly you would have no

1825
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,920
problem getting in that in here okay and

1826
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,420
price starts to trade off and does

1827
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,820
another explosive move going down

1828
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,600
if you are remembering that you have the

1829
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,420
99.20 and

1830
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,000
99.50 mid figure and institutional 20s

1831
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,699
on your chart okay

1832
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,620
price breaks down and then does what

1833
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,140
comes right back up to it and gives you

1834
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,540
the entry right in here right at the

1835
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,159
level you've already identified inside

1836
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,020
of a bearish order block on a daily

1837
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,040
chart

1838
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,320
it's been refined you have all the

1839
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,820
conviction now that you need because you

1840
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,440
see institutional order flow is

1841
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,080
respecting where they should sell they

1842
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,360
are selling and then we have a big range

1843
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,080
liquidity void in here price comes back

1844
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,520
boom right at the level you already

1845
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,480
anticipate 99 20. 99 20 is based on a

1846
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,120
daily chart where banks are referring to

1847
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,860
this is not a five minute set up it's

1848
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,120
not a 15 minute step it's not even an

1849
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,640
hourly setup this 20 Level was already

1850
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,100
based on the Range that was created on

1851
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,320
The Daily ICT order block and we refined

1852
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,060
It Down to What two levels are

1853
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,860
essentially what you should be trading

1854
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:00,659
at 99.50 and 99.20 okay so let's go down

1855
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:04,699
further into an hourly chart

1856
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,360
foreign

1857
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,580
oh we'll have to stick with the four

1858
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,560
hour

1859
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,239
I went back a little too far for that

1860
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:35,159
too ambitious of a

1861
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,860
study

1862
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,960
so let's zoom in

1863
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:47,719
okay and we have

1864
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:51,179
several things in here that uh are

1865
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:52,860
indicative of what you would expect to

1866
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:57,000
see in price so when we see price action

1867
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,800
turning like it is here

1868
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,500
okay you can see price action on Market

1869
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,239
structure model

1870
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,600
we have a swing High a higher swing High

1871
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,840
a lower swing high and in between that

1872
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,280
think like Head and Shoulders tight

1873
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,100
formation okay it breaks down it comes

1874
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,380
down I'm not looking at this retest back

1875
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,640
to a neckline type thing because if you

1876
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,020
look at it doesn't even do that it

1877
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,280
doesn't retest the neckline if you're

1878
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,900
looking ahead and shoulders but I'm

1879
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,460
looking at it in such a way where it

1880
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,679
shows a breakdown in Market structure it

1881
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,659
does in fact do that

1882
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:30,920
if you look at what goes on also

1883
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,800
the ultimate High here okay the question

1884
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,480
I like to do is when I'm looking at

1885
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,920
Price action let's take this all because

1886
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,260
we don't need that one anymore

1887
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,380
let's zoom in

1888
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,060
these are some of the things that I have

1889
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,040
as an internal dialogue when I look at

1890
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,780
Price action either real time or if I'm

1891
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,580
looking at things in hindsight trying to

1892
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:53,100
frame an idea want a future move or kind

1893
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,440
of like forecast when I see things like

1894
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,159
that uh like this high in here okay my

1895
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,320
question is always this okay it could

1896
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,060
have turned on this high

1897
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,440
and it could have dropped right from

1898
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,420
there but it didn't do that

1899
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,179
it ran up one more time and then dropped

1900
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:11,580
off so when I see that inside of an area

1901
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,940
when I'm anticipating a sell-off okay

1902
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,219
I view that as it came back and took out

1903
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,460
early fare stops and they're gonna have

1904
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,140
buy stops right above this High because

1905
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,580
they're trying to sell it short and they

1906
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,320
see these two down candles they get in

1907
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,520
there thinking okay I'm gonna try to

1908
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,920
catch the high and that's why I do not

1909
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,080
trade like that

1910
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,940
looking for the liquidity that's resting

1911
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,800
above the high in here in the form of a

1912
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,520
stop

1913
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,880
buy stops on shorts okay they rally them

1914
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,940
up take those people out of the

1915
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,020
marketplace

1916
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,520
to take the other side of the trade

1917
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,560
those buy stops to come orders to buy at

1918
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,179
the market which is exactly what they

1919
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:49,620
want to use as a counterparty to get

1920
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,360
short they're going to sell those buy

1921
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,460
stops to them

1922
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,500
that's the position they hold for a move

1923
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,540
lower when price starts to trade back

1924
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,520
down and makes this a little bit of a 10

1925
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,780
it trades up into a bear's order block

1926
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,820
and it sells off

1927
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,739
your thought process should be

1928
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:06,000
immediately okay

1929
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,340
if they're selling back here and we're

1930
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,800
in a daily setup inside this ICT order

1931
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,580
blog a daily setup can see it retrained

1932
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,380
back into it in a four hour two I don't

1933
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,360
like to see it do it more than once but

1934
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,940
in this area we're in that daily order

1935
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:26,840
block right in here okay look closely

1936
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,000
this candle right here

1937
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,159
is the breaker

1938
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:38,159
that they bought that takes the rally up

1939
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,440
above this high it's the down candle

1940
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,300
prior to the swing taking out an old

1941
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,239
high this turtle soup set up

1942
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:48,480
the foundation to it is in this down

1943
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,780
candle right here okay and by

1944
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,340
incorporating the bottom of that handle

1945
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,260
okay let's show the low

1946
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,340
if I can get it to highlight

1947
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,920
the low comes in at

1948
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,659
99.32

1949
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,760
99.32 when price creates this big

1950
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,300
liquidity void okay don't assume that

1951
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,460
it's got to go back to this candle here

1952
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,320
don't assume that

1953
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,600
you have to look at the what has

1954
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,300
happened this is all things that supply

1955
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,460
and demand does not teach you okay

1956
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,580
supply and demand says you can't cut

1957
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,260
through candles

1958
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,420
you can't look past through whatever

1959
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,280
this is this is the you know you can

1960
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,440
this is a fresh level or it's a fresh

1961
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,360
Zone and they're going to look to try to

1962
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,500
sell up in here and they're going to

1963
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,820
miss the boat

1964
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,679
they're going to miss the trade

1965
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,360
Banks aren't looking at the same well

1966
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,540
this is where uh the fresh level is

1967
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:44,520
they're going to see

1968
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,199
that the orders that were used to buy

1969
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,880
the market up here and drive price up

1970
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,040
okay and there's some of you think oh

1971
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,100
your conspiracy theory

1972
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,320
take a field trip okay take a field trip

1973
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,420
out to Chicago Board trade take a field

1974
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,159
trip out to the walls uh you know Wall

1975
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,219
Street and talk to Specialists talk to

1976
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,719
people that are actually doing it okay

1977
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:06,179
and they'll tell you that there are

1978
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,640
drives on liquidity in the marketplace

1979
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
they'll run the highs they'll run the

1980
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,540
lows because when it happens it creates

1981
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,880
all this fever there's all this

1982
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,159
excitement there's all this uh you know

1983
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,080
in induction of liquidity in the

1984
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,300
marketplace and because of that that's

1985
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,520
where trades form and they love to do

1986
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,860
that because markets are just

1987
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,560
they're they're only out there to take

1988
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,420
the liquidity that's what you're in here

1989
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,640
to do you're trading liquidity you're

1990
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,560
not trading price you're trading

1991
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,480
liquidity just because you want a price

1992
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,699
level you're not getting that price

1993
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,520
I don't want uh you know I'm sorry I I

1994
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,400
may want a specific price level on cable

1995
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,400
or Fiber just because I want it doesn't

1996
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,340
mean anything I gotta take the trade

1997
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:53,219
and agree on taking the trade based on

1998
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:55,320
the parameters that's being set up in in

1999
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,340
the market

2000
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,440
either the market price is offering

2001
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,239
something that I'm able to live with in

2002
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,040
terms of where it is and where I'm

2003
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,140
willing to get in a trade or I pass on

2004
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,800
the situation and take no trade at all

2005
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,080
you have to look at

2006
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,140
price action with that mindset okay

2007
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,840
the retail platforms are going to be

2008
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,100
very

2009
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,460
very close but not to the tip of what

2010
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,739
the injured Bank levels are okay the

2011
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:24,480
overall Market direction is going to be

2012
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,060
similar okay there's going to be a

2013
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,980
disparity between what the interbank

2014
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,500
pricing engines are and what your

2015
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,960
individual platforms are showing and

2016
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,820
you're going to have to accept that

2017
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,860
there's no way around it you can argue

2018
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,739
about it we can all agree it's crap but

2019
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,300
they have to have a model that allows

2020
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,699
them to be profitable whether it be

2021
01:19:44,699 --> 01:19:46,739
Savory or not that's something for

2022
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:48,540
another day to argue about but bottom

2023
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,760
line is this is your opportunity the

2024
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,920
trade you have to use a retail broker

2025
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,940
until you get more money you can trade

2026
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,699
Prime burgers this is how you do it but

2027
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:59,400
you have to look at why when this price

2028
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,199
runs up and it starts to break down go

2029
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,900
back to this you have to cut through

2030
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,960
some candles you got to and it it'll

2031
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,480
give you the basis of why things should

2032
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,100
take place going forward

2033
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,440
this run up

2034
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,320
the down candle which is a ICT bullish

2035
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,020
order block okay and

2036
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,159
uh

2037
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,800
primarily bullish conditions if price

2038
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,540
came back down to that area we could be

2039
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,340
buying expecting higher prices but

2040
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,960
notice it was happening this is

2041
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,179
occurring in a daily bearish order block

2042
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:32,699
inside that orange range

2043
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:35,520
so this is actually inside of that

2044
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,800
bearish order block and it drove price

2045
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,060
up

2046
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,880
do not look at that as a new buying

2047
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,100
opportunity

2048
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,560
some buying took place in here okay and

2049
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,540
maybe there's some out there that try

2050
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,400
try to use supply and demand and they

2051
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,320
look at this as a continuation maybe

2052
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,179
they looked at this as support maybe

2053
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:55,380
this looked at I don't know what they

2054
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,120
looked at okay and that's not what I

2055
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,800
view price like

2056
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,380
my perspective and my thought process is

2057
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,540
if they ran it up here and then it broke

2058
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,300
down this was a stop run so where did

2059
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,340
they buy the run the stops the down

2060
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,320
candle probably don't move there's your

2061
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,960
breaker so when you have that note to

2062
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,080
low the candle okay and limited to the

2063
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,239
body of the candle not the high it

2064
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,520
cannot do that yes but your trade is

2065
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,020
going to be in the body of the candle so

2066
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,820
what am I saying I'm saying that if you

2067
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,060
take

2068
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,540
this range

2069
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,560
the body of the candle to the body of

2070
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,260
the candle okay so to open and close

2071
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,239
extend that out

2072
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:42,420
it does not get to the bottom of this up

2073
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,300
candle prior to the down move because it

2074
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,560
doesn't have to

2075
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,300
all the orders that need to be mitigated

2076
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,640
that they use to go long to drive price

2077
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,340
up those Longs have to be taken and

2078
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,199
canceled they got to be collapsed but

2079
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,280
they're not going to collapse on down

2080
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,120
here

2081
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,620
when price gets back up to it they're

2082
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,760
going to collapse right here they so

2083
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,620
they are mitigating the open long

2084
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,360
positions that have been utilized to

2085
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,460
drive price up they'll liquidate them

2086
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,540
here

2087
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:12,840
then liquidating and new accumulation

2088
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,659
for shorts is why there's only a short

2089
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:16,980
little period of time where it trades

2090
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,360
there and it runs away

2091
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,420
because you're having two factors being

2092
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,699
introduced at the same time you're

2093
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:25,920
selling longs

2094
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,140
that were established here you're

2095
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,480
selling those Longs which is going to be

2096
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,140
a an absence of buying okay and an

2097
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,420
increased effect of selling which is the

2098
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,860
natural order of things in the

2099
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,120
marketplace it's always a seller's

2100
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,400
market always a seller's marketing so

2101
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,040
when you have that absence of buying and

2102
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,040
you have a large introduction of new

2103
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,739
selling why are they going to sell more

2104
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:51,900
because they they collapse their lungs

2105
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,940
because they don't believe fundamentally

2106
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,980
that they're going to go higher so they

2107
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,040
come back into this liquidity void and

2108
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,320
this void which would be essentially

2109
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,860
closed here is not necessary

2110
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,080
to be traded up to you only got to go

2111
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,460
back to the breaker

2112
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,679
so that's how you use the breaker in

2113
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:12,659
combination with liquidity voids there

2114
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,820
are some times where it can come back up

2115
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,920
in there and trade that and that that

2116
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,900
may be detrimental for your trade or it

2117
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,000
may be another opportunity to get a

2118
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,340
better price entry it depends on how

2119
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,840
much range is there and what you're able

2120
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,300
to assume on the trade now you can trade

2121
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,280
the four hour setup like this and create

2122
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,860
a whole lot of uh Pips in terms of the

2123
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,900
stop loss that's needed but guess what

2124
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,820
the rest of the reward's still the same

2125
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,800
just takes a whole lot more time for the

2126
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,239
trades to pan out

2127
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:41,520
and don't don't don't despair is the

2128
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,040
whole idea of trading on a four-hour uh

2129
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,420
time frame because if you can't be in

2130
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,920
front of the charts on an intraday basis

2131
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,560
you can trade these setups every single

2132
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,239
month there's something out there and

2133
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,159
there's a lot of a lot of Pips to be

2134
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:54,840
made like that but you got to keep

2135
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,840
things relative to you know the risk

2136
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,820
so

2137
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:03,840
again going back to this um this low

2138
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,159
right in here

2139
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:07,280
on this candle the load comes in at

2140
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,320
99.32 so just like we used for the order

2141
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,440
block okay my question is okay for if

2142
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,900
the low on that candle is 99.32 and the

2143
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,340
high is 99.50 okay and the open is 99.41

2144
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,060
the body is the open and close so 99.41

2145
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,719
and 99.32 is your range my question is

2146
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:29,400
what's the price level you would use to

2147
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,920
go short using the breaker

2148
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,739
99.35

2149
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:37,380
that's your mid Midway Point okay inside

2150
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,300
the body at rounded to the five you can

2151
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,340
go with 30 and be early there's nothing

2152
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,179
wrong with that because we're only

2153
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:45,900
talking about 40 was it 41 yeah 41

2154
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:46,980
what's the high of the body of this

2155
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,800
candle so if you're okay with that and

2156
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,719
measuring your risk okay you can get

2157
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,760
short at 99 30 which is the round number

2158
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,280
going into that candle because you

2159
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,719
already have the expectation that this

2160
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,400
is going to be a breaker because of all

2161
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,620
the backdrop the daily bear shorter

2162
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,179
block the fact that we ran this high

2163
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,280
right here and it's now broken down it's

2164
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,020
giving you all indications that it's

2165
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,179
going lower did you miss the opportunity

2166
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:11,520
to get short up here yes did you miss

2167
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,540
the opportunity to get short here

2168
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,800
possibly

2169
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,780
but this one right here

2170
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,900
you're trading at 99.20 based on the

2171
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,140
daily setup or you're fine-tuning it

2172
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,179
using the four hour chart for a breaker

2173
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:29,280
at 99.35 or 99 40 or 9930 okay based on

2174
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,800
where your risk is there's your levels

2175
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,659
that's how you that's how you as the

2176
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:35,040
trader do it you see the difference

2177
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,920
about teaching it like this versus this

2178
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,239
is how you do it every single time

2179
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,040
because what I'm willing to assume on

2180
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,960
the risk is not the same thing that

2181
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,980
you're going to be willing to assuming

2182
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:46,620
risk and your Proficiency in trading

2183
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,480
price isn't going to be the same level

2184
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,120
that I have Okay so

2185
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,920
I may be able to trade with a 10 pip

2186
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,260
stop I don't do that but I may be able

2187
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,820
to do that

2188
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,860
you may not be able to

2189
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,780
and you may look at what I'm framing as

2190
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,400
a trade say well

2191
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,380
I don't know about that and then you'll

2192
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,420
argue if it makes money you'll say I

2193
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,400
wish I would have did it or if you take

2194
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,780
it and it doesn't make money and it gets

2195
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,159
stopped out I knew I shouldn't have done

2196
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:13,139
that it's too small of a stop loss I

2197
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:15,239
never do that you see what happens it

2198
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:17,820
plagues your thinking versus your

2199
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,139
development

2200
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:21,659
your choices on trade selection are

2201
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:24,060
going to ultimately be yours they're

2202
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,179
never ever ever going to be mine or the

2203
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:29,699
guy you talk to online or your Mentor if

2204
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:31,800
they are you're doing it wrong

2205
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,500
because it's not your trade now is it

2206
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,020
you're piggybacking and I know some of

2207
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,460
you well it's making money I really

2208
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,440
don't care I don't care it could be

2209
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,820
somebody else's trade

2210
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,620
I guarantee you if you have that thought

2211
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,739
process you will not be doing this long

2212
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:48,120
you're going to lose money you're going

2213
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,380
to lose your account you're not going to

2214
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,400
be Trading

2215
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,020
and that's real world stuff right there

2216
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,460
you can't get any more real talk than

2217
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,020
that

2218
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,040
but by looking at things like this okay

2219
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,239
let's look at another opportunity of

2220
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,800
using breaker because the last the last

2221
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,120
couple times we had live sessions you

2222
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,800
guys were really heavily beating on me

2223
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,239
about well here's the breaker here and

2224
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,060
the breaker there so let's take a look

2225
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,040
at one more

2226
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,400
and then I'm going to close this

2227
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,600
portion of the topic

2228
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,540
uh what did I want to do here oh

2229
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,560
let's take everything off

2230
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,199
I gotta make sure I remember to talk

2231
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,580
about the cable tray because I prompted

2232
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,020
you guys I'm doing this stuff now

2233
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,880
because my wife told me that I will not

2234
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,940
be doing any videos tonight

2235
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,560
so uh I'm doing it now so I'm trying to

2236
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,239
answer everything so I want to go to you

2237
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,980
later on tonight we have an old high

2238
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,380
back here okay and let's go out a little

2239
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,480
bit one more time

2240
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,920
okay we have an old high here

2241
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:55,260
and I want you to think about as price

2242
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,699
was Trading

2243
01:27:56,699 --> 01:27:59,480
in here

2244
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:06,060
price made this high and sold off and

2245
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:11,460
then resumed going higher okay and

2246
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,980
my question is is what was the primary

2247
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:14,880
trend

2248
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,739
even right here

2249
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:18,239
and when I was trading down what was the

2250
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,280
primary trend

2251
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:23,040
on a daily chart has been going on

2252
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,540
not like that I'm going to show it but

2253
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,000
it's been going up see higher higher

2254
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,860
higher

2255
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,659
so institution order flow

2256
01:28:30,659 --> 01:28:33,420
is primarily long

2257
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,300
okay so price comes down moves back into

2258
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,000
an area of order flow and starts to

2259
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,440
Rally up

2260
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,460
right here

2261
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,520
let me zoom in

2262
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,780
yeah right there

2263
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,080
right here price made a down candle

2264
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:06,540
right below an old high I love that I

2265
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,420
absolutely love seeing that set up okay

2266
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:12,000
it's very similar to uh when we talk

2267
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,020
about

2268
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,780
um optimal or high

2269
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:19,380
odds bearish order blocks okay where

2270
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,719
there is usually a high

2271
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:26,460
okay a short-term High rate below an ICT

2272
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,080
bearish order block

2273
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,360
that's like a it's like a no-brainer

2274
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,060
setup it's so very very powerful well

2275
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,420
along the same vein this is what is very

2276
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,400
similar to that when we have an old high

2277
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,219
like this okay and prices traded up and

2278
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:43,260
then it's starting to sell off okay what

2279
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:46,500
you're seeing is weak bulls that think

2280
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,540
that this is going to be resistance

2281
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,540
so they sell it and

2282
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,880
dare I say it potentially maybe there

2283
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,239
should be some Supply up there maybe

2284
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,560
there's some Supply Traders up here

2285
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,639
trying to sell it because look what it

2286
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:01,860
did There's Supply there and it's sold

2287
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,780
off so we're back up to that level again

2288
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,340
we're gonna sell it again there's some

2289
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:08,100
Supply okay I love this setup because

2290
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:11,100
what this is is they're they're

2291
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:15,179
introducing uh a setup that allows folks

2292
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:16,500
to do that very thing

2293
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,620
and as the Market's dropping down

2294
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,679
do professional Traders sell or do they

2295
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:25,080
buy in those environments Down Down

2296
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,179
Candles okay some four hour chart so

2297
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:28,620
it's a lot of range

2298
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,480
this down candle right here at the far

2299
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,460
right of the chart I know I don't have a

2300
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,380
highlighted on my cursor I don't have

2301
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,659
the opportunity to do that with live

2302
01:30:36,659 --> 01:30:39,239
sessions like this but the down candle

2303
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:40,920
okay

2304
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,199
bonus four hour chart it's a down candle

2305
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,000
just because it's before hour doesn't

2306
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,340
make a difference but we understand it's

2307
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,159
the the largest players in the industry

2308
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:53,580
which is the banks okay they're going to

2309
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,940
buy in down moves

2310
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,860
they're going to be buying as the market

2311
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,199
moves lower they have to do that to get

2312
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,100
a better

2313
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,840
uh

2314
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,179
average price you know getting into the

2315
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:09,179
uh the trade when I see setups like this

2316
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:11,820
happen it's wonderful opportunity to set

2317
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,159
up number one confirmation that we're

2318
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,980
going to blow through this okay secondly

2319
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,980
it sets up future opportunities because

2320
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,080
there's a whole lot of

2321
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,120
buying and selling interest on a level

2322
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,219
like this because we are it's inside of

2323
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:29,340
an old High inside of a range and it's

2324
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,840
down so now think about what's going to

2325
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,920
happen here there's gonna be a lot of

2326
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,260
buying in here

2327
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,280
when it blows through it like this okay

2328
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,440
watch what happens as price goes on

2329
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,139
price comes back down okay and then look

2330
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:45,000
what happens look at the reaction rate

2331
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,560
in here

2332
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,860
this reaction right here trading right

2333
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,600
back up into what we just described

2334
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,540
earlier is the breaker

2335
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,800
let me highlight that and put that back

2336
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,780
on here

2337
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,340
when I tell you guys look at the daily

2338
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,320
and four hour chart I'm not telling you

2339
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,620
that

2340
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,860
I'm wasting my breath doing it I want

2341
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:10,800
you to do it because every major setup

2342
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,800
that you'll see in price is going to be

2343
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,480
found on the daily in the four hour that

2344
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,460
that's a given

2345
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,760
you want sizable explosive price moves

2346
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,380
everybody does

2347
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,060
but you're never going to find them

2348
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,280
outside of those two time frames I mean

2349
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,659
you can obviously find them on a weekly

2350
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:28,800
and a monthly chart that goes without

2351
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,300
saying but

2352
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,100
the dynamic price levels that you're

2353
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,840
going to trade off of that you get this

2354
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,480
real big explosive boom I mean it just

2355
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,760
explode you don't have any time wasted

2356
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,980
it it gets to those levels and then it

2357
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,360
tears and goes the other direction to

2358
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,699
another level that makes sense what do I

2359
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:47,219
mean by that well we explained how price

2360
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:49,739
reversed up here on a daily bearish ICT

2361
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:51,239
order block

2362
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:54,060
then price more you know makes it move

2363
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:57,000
lower we marked off our breaker

2364
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,620
and this is where price would reach to

2365
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:02,760
not here could it have sure could have

2366
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,800
but it didn't it didn't have to because

2367
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,179
the buy orders that we used to run the

2368
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:08,219
stops on this old high that's the reason

2369
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:10,500
why now by itself right there that

2370
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,760
argument right there this one

2371
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,679
presentation just kicks supply and

2372
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,239
demand right into nuts

2373
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:18,300
you can and you must cut through candles

2374
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,719
you have to look at the context of what

2375
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:23,580
price action is telling you

2376
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,260
but because supply and demand doesn't

2377
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,000
teach you or even imply an interest in

2378
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,400
showing you how the institutions are

2379
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,139
trading they're just giving you one

2380
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:36,120
little tiny little facet of okay it

2381
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,800
moves from here so if it goes back there

2382
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,600
it probably will happen again there's no

2383
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,360
difference in that Fibonacci Trading

2384
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,400
and I just nailed it right there supply

2385
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,540
and demand

2386
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,400
put a fib on your trades and it's the

2387
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,040
same thing trade 79 retracement levels

2388
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,139
and 60 tracing levels and you're gonna

2389
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:53,280
get the same thing supply and demand

2390
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,980
gives you done it's handled so it's a

2391
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:58,980
gimmick but it gets you very close on

2392
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,500
some instances but it really won't do

2393
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,300
anything except for take credit they

2394
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,199
won't be able to explain anything

2395
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:06,600
outside of see we were right

2396
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,719
my work gives you the X-ray view of why

2397
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:12,719
price is doing it okay and by studying

2398
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,580
hindsight examples of seeing it happen

2399
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,620
on hot larger time frames like the daily

2400
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,719
and four hour it will give you the

2401
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,060
context to frame your future trades or

2402
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,560
at least give you the framework to start

2403
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,739
trading ideas and practice them because

2404
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:27,600
until you start thinking like this and

2405
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,739
like where we have to explain here

2406
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:31,260
you're not going to get it

2407
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,500
what is it consistently profitable

2408
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,760
because you're going to have hit and

2409
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,000
missed types of trading instead of

2410
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,460
surgical strikes Precision in and out

2411
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,840
knowing why you're doing it when to do

2412
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,340
it when not to do it

2413
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,960
that's what you need to know as a Trader

2414
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:50,340
not reacting and wishing on regretting

2415
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,739
and just being just totally upset

2416
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,239
because you don't know what you're doing

2417
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,760
and it's frustrating believe me I know

2418
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,400
what that felt like okay but you were

2419
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,739
expecting a Magic Bullet and you're not

2420
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:03,420
going to get the Magic Bullet to give

2421
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:06,300
you the Insight like that it's gonna

2422
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,040
have to go through a process of doing

2423
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,900
what I'm doing here and that's why the

2424
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,120
 that watch and troll they don't

2425
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,620
they don't like it because they want

2426
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,719
easy clicks they want an indicator they

2427
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:17,340
want something to plug on a chart and

2428
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:20,100
show it to them this is the indicator

2429
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,520
the open the high the low and the close

2430
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,500
and the reactions that it creates on

2431
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,679
your chart and you're studying the

2432
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:30,719
psychology in the marketplace that's

2433
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,520
what price action is doing it's

2434
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,699
measuring the psychological effects of

2435
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:38,580
what other Traders and the only Trader

2436
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,960
group that we care about is the

2437
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,400
institutional Traders

2438
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,380
they're the ones that move price because

2439
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,420
our mindset is focused on what they're

2440
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:48,900
doing and how they react well they're

2441
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,880
they're they're the Predator they're the

2442
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,219
apex predator on the food chain so if

2443
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:55,320
you align your thinking like they do and

2444
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,480
they view stops as opportunity their

2445
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,340
bullseyes not protections and shields

2446
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,380
believe me the banks are driving

2447
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,659
bulldozers and you're standing there

2448
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:06,120
with a little pinwheel that's your stop

2449
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,580
but they're mowing you over there's no

2450
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,380
they're not worried about what's going

2451
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:11,760
to be the ramifications of you getting

2452
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,460
stopped out you're just one more piece

2453
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:17,040
of meat going in the grinder there's no

2454
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,500
reason for you to view your stop loss in

2455
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,420
any other way except for yes it's your

2456
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,280
only protection and shield but it's a

2457
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,960
bullseye in the form of the

2458
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,239
institutional mindset

2459
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:28,739
so bringing it

2460
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:30,239
that you didn't think you'd hear those

2461
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,260
types of things when you first got

2462
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,060
started in trading you thought it was a

2463
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,020
free opportunity to be everything's Fair

2464
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:38,880
we all want to see you make money that's

2465
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,739
 they want your money they want

2466
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,900
you to fail okay and they want you to

2467
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,060
blame your indicators

2468
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,800
they do they want you to blame it

2469
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,600
because what that does it feeds the fire

2470
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,300
for someone else's new book a new system

2471
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,520
and new stuff and it brings in like PT

2472
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,679
Barnum said there's a sucker born every

2473
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:56,580
second

2474
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,960
done

2475
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,580
well

2476
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,139
it's your choice if you want to stay in

2477
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:02,699
that sucker Realm

2478
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:04,320
do you want to listen to on

2479
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,520
Twitter telling you the stuff you're

2480
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,199
learning doesn't work or do you want to

2481
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,139
put the time in and see that it does

2482
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:11,880
and don't expect it to happen overnight

2483
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,659
I told every one of you six months of in

2484
01:37:15,659 --> 01:37:17,820
the trenches dealing with this stuff on

2485
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,620
a daily day basis now I know some of you

2486
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,940
could say well I'm like oh I've been

2487
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:23,159
following you since 2010 it isn't

2488
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:24,780
clicking and you should have told me

2489
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,219
this stuff from the beginning no I

2490
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:27,719
shouldn't have

2491
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:30,120
no no I shouldn't have and I'm gonna

2492
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,139
tell you a reason why I shouldn't have

2493
01:37:31,139 --> 01:37:33,900
it if you can't if you can't get this or

2494
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,100
understand or agree with it that's

2495
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,120
between

2496
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,880
you and your problem with it okay

2497
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,800
because I can't fix it for you

2498
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,600
you

2499
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,360
have to go through the process of seeing

2500
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,639
why retail Traders think like they do

2501
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:49,199
not just simply reading in a book and

2502
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,820
say okay yeah I get it no you don't get

2503
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,820
it you don't get it okay you do not get

2504
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,360
it until you see it in price action

2505
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,219
when these yahoos get on there and they

2506
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:01,080
say hey look you know this guy's talking

2507
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,940
about this and that

2508
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,739
believe me you're going to laugh your

2509
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:06,900
ass off too because they're clueless

2510
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,239
twits they have no idea what they're

2511
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:10,800
doing they're out there chasing the next

2512
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,659
best thing and guess what from for a

2513
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,880
little while I was like that for them I

2514
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,380
was the next best thing because I could

2515
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,580
show something it made a little bit of

2516
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,080
sense oh yeah order blocks oh yeah

2517
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,360
optimal trade entries oh yeah they ran

2518
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,639
on trading view oh I'm glad you showed

2519
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:25,620
up ICT I've been I've been using the OTE

2520
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:29,580
for months and it's just been phenomenal

2521
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,980
hmm

2522
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,320
it's not all OT

2523
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,080
it's not all order blocks

2524
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:40,080
it's how you look at the marketplace

2525
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,960
and you judge based on what the chart is

2526
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,600
showing you where has it shown a

2527
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,100
willingness to sell off

2528
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,560
why would it have sold off there

2529
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,719
these are all thought processes that you

2530
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:55,320
have to go through okay so there's a

2531
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,540
dialogue that you must have with

2532
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,840
yourself as a Trader it's self-talk

2533
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,380
we all have it in all varying degrees as

2534
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,199
a Trader we all have self-talk

2535
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,600
self-talk in the beginning as a noob is

2536
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,639
man I have no idea what the hell I'm

2537
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:13,500
doing I need to find somebody who knows

2538
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,699
what they're doing and just copy them

2539
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,520
that's self-talk is that empowering or

2540
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,440
is that self-defeating

2541
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,940
self-defeating

2542
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,219
you're in you're staying with a mindset

2543
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:27,120
that is dependent and not independent

2544
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,280
okay

2545
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,500
or empowering at all you're you're

2546
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,179
subscribing to the thought process that

2547
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:35,639
number one a you're weak you're clueless

2548
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:37,500
okay and that you need to have someone

2549
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,060
else tell you what to do

2550
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:42,420
now that's the reality of it yes but if

2551
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,120
you don't change the way you think

2552
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,080
you're not going to look at the

2553
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,639
marketplace the right way

2554
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:49,679
because you're going to look at and I'm

2555
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,000
going to take one more step further in

2556
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,780
this

2557
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,159
think about when you first started as a

2558
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:55,080
retail Trader you start thinking okay

2559
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,840
where's the next guy in the line of all

2560
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,520
of us okay that knows what he's doing

2561
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,020
it's making money because you don't know

2562
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,060
how to talk to a bank Trader you didn't

2563
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,760
believe the bank Traders do this

2564
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,280
think about it and honesty you didn't

2565
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,380
know that you wanted to find someone on

2566
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,960
internet someone on Twitter someone on

2567
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,719
Instagram someone on Facebook someone on

2568
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:18,060
an Instagram or infomercial someone

2569
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,580
advertising something a direct mailing

2570
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,460
okay telling you that they're doing it

2571
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,900
and

2572
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,699
maybe you thought it was horseshit maybe

2573
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:28,679
you thought it was all smoke and mirrors

2574
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:32,040
but the advertisement or the fact that

2575
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,420
they ran their mouth as much as they did

2576
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,620
and you've probably seen that happen

2577
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,120
with me

2578
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,980
man this guy he wouldn't leave you alone

2579
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:40,260
it starts gnawing at you and you have to

2580
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,360
just dig into it and see what it is and

2581
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,980
it doesn't pan out

2582
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,739
why why doesn't it pan out

2583
01:40:46,739 --> 01:40:49,980
because you have not taken it as your

2584
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,940
own

2585
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,699
you have not changed this whole

2586
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:56,580
perspective on trading and made it your

2587
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:57,600
own

2588
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,340
now I'm not saying take my stuff and

2589
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,080
take someone else's stuff and remarket

2590
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,340
it and sell it that's not what I mean by

2591
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,960
make it your own okay what I mean by

2592
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,719
make it your own is internalize it break

2593
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,179
it down into my new details where you

2594
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:11,580
understand each component and then begin

2595
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,860
to flush each component together and

2596
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,960
then your trading model will materialize

2597
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,980
from that

2598
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:19,679
I've given you so many tools and I've

2599
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,900
tickled when I see so many people come

2600
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,000
at me in an email or they do direct

2601
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,500
messages on Twitter which I really don't

2602
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,880
like doing those things because I get so

2603
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,260
many of them I have a lot of them on

2604
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:29,400
there and I haven't even opened up yet

2605
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,760
so if you sent me those by Twitter just

2606
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,320
know that I don't like to do those and

2607
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,580
I'm not trying to be ignorant to you I'm

2608
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,199
not trying to just ignore you I'm trying

2609
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,580
to ignore everyone

2610
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,920
because there's too many of them so uh

2611
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,280
looking at Price action you need to

2612
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,580
adopt the mindset of okay

2613
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,739
my trading is my Trading

2614
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:51,719
okay and everything that I do in my

2615
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:54,119
trading is going to be my responsibility

2616
01:41:54,119 --> 01:41:57,239
so the fruits of it or the

2617
01:41:57,239 --> 01:42:00,420
the bad events that take place I have to

2618
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:03,060
own that and I have to take ownership of

2619
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:06,239
the good and the bad and the bad I have

2620
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,420
to be sober minded and learn from it I

2621
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,880
can't be a victim and say well you did

2622
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,280
this to me or you held this back from me

2623
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,520
I I did I held back stuff yeah for your

2624
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,280
better for your environment your you

2625
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,580
didn't have the capacity to look at this

2626
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:24,659
stuff like you did because you didn't

2627
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:25,980
have the time looking at Price action

2628
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,860
the way I look at Price action

2629
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:31,380
you have to be able to discern the

2630
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,000
distinction between how retail-minded

2631
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,980
Traders and even back then in baby Pips

2632
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,719
a lot of you didn't even think like a

2633
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,119
retail Trader does you didn't know

2634
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:40,980
anything you were just looking for the

2635
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,179
next thing

2636
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:43,860
there were retail Traders out there that

2637
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:45,420
were hanging and banging still

2638
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,119
unprofitable but they had a method of

2639
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:50,040
what they were trying to make work but

2640
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,480
they're trying to force a square peg

2641
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,179
into a round hole it won't work you got

2642
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,340
to cut some Corners off okay you got to

2643
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:57,900
smooth out those rough edges and that's

2644
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,960
going to happen by taking time and I had

2645
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,480
to drag you across this spectrum of time

2646
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,639
for a reason

2647
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:08,340
if you look at Price action with a

2648
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:11,100
single mindset that there's someone out

2649
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,800
there that's trying to knock you out

2650
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,960
there's someone out there that is an

2651
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,580
adversary to you

2652
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:19,920
someone out there is trying to

2653
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,800
collectively work towards you not being

2654
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,020
successful

2655
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:27,360
if I sell that to everyone when I first

2656
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,380
meet them

2657
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,540
they plug their ears this guy's a

2658
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,219
conspiracy nut he doesn't know what he's

2659
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:34,199
talking about he's not responsible he's

2660
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:35,699
blaming someone else and I'm the only

2661
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:36,840
one in the whole room that knows what

2662
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,320
the hell's going on

2663
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,880
I'm the black sheep of the whole fold

2664
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,400
and I got no problem being that because

2665
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,420
all the other Lambs are getting

2666
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:46,739
slaughtered

2667
01:43:46,739 --> 01:43:50,159
I'm still here 20 years plus and I'm

2668
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,020
gonna be here hopefully Lord willing 20

2669
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,000
more years

2670
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,800
where are you going to be

2671
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,840
are you gonna be in the same mindset as

2672
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,300
a Trader trying to figure out what you

2673
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,159
know what the next guy's doing instead

2674
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,780
of saying I don't give a what the

2675
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:05,100
next guy's doing

2676
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,780
I need to know what I'm going to be

2677
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,520
doing right now and I'm going to move

2678
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,739
towards making it better for myself and

2679
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:13,139
that way as long as I know I'm thinking

2680
01:44:13,139 --> 01:44:15,960
the way I'm thinking independently if

2681
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,820
I'm wrong I'm not going to second guess

2682
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:19,619
I'm wrong I'm going to know right away

2683
01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:22,619
I'm wrong and I gotta reevaluate what I

2684
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:24,420
did there and try not to make that same

2685
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,639
mistake again contrast that with

2686
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,739
following someone copycatting their

2687
01:44:28,739 --> 01:44:29,820
trades

2688
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,040
the guy's wrong ninety percent of time

2689
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,060
he's not going to admit that he was

2690
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,400
wrong he won't even admit to it he'll

2691
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,840
suit you know he'll he'll gloss over it

2692
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,179
or if it's a bad thing like he loses the

2693
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:40,679
account or busts it or does something

2694
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:42,659
really bad he just vanishes

2695
01:44:42,659 --> 01:44:44,159
yes the beautiful thing about the

2696
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,900
internet people can pop up and be

2697
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,520
millionaires instantly

2698
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,679
but the real people hang around they

2699
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,600
prove it over and over again okay and

2700
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,100
they can take ownership of having

2701
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,560
screwed up sometimes you miss an

2702
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,239
opportunity you blow it you get stopped

2703
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:59,340
out things like that's going to happen

2704
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:03,179
but if you are tied to someone like that

2705
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:05,639
whether they're a good Trader or not you

2706
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:06,900
aren't going to come to the conclusion

2707
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,340
that hey look this is wrong and no right

2708
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,840
away you're going to be waiting on

2709
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,699
baited breath to figure out what they're

2710
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,560
going to say to give you the thought

2711
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,300
process that you should have because

2712
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:17,159
you've already subscribed to them being

2713
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:20,580
the Brain Trust in the whole event

2714
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,139
you didn't make the decision to take the

2715
01:45:22,139 --> 01:45:23,219
trade

2716
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:25,380
so all these components that we have out

2717
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,600
here as retail Traders all these ideas

2718
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,420
and methodologies and applications and

2719
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,820
processes and such unless it gets down

2720
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,619
to the root

2721
01:45:34,619 --> 01:45:37,139
principle of you making the decisions on

2722
01:45:37,139 --> 01:45:39,540
your own and that's going to be whether

2723
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,159
your Mentor thinks something's going to

2724
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:44,040
happen in agreement or or

2725
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,139
contrary to what you think

2726
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:47,699
come hell or high water you're taking

2727
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:49,260
that trade

2728
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,300
you don't care what anybody else thinks

2729
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,699
that's you this is you or you're owning

2730
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:55,500
it and I don't care what the what the

2731
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,840
outcome is going to be it's mine

2732
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,139
because only you can take the spoils

2733
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:02,159
from it

2734
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,920
or the lumps from it

2735
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,139
it's yours you have to own it so when

2736
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:08,760
you look at Price action it's not just

2737
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,500
simply looking at order blocks it's not

2738
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,119
simply looking at optimal trade entry

2739
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:14,040
retracements and tips okay it's not

2740
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:15,840
liquidity voids and liquidity pools and

2741
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,900
it's not institutional uh uh order flow

2742
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,460
and it's not just

2743
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,260
um Market maker Buy sell profiles and

2744
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,119
fractal patterns and such it's not

2745
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:25,679
animal patterns harmonics none of that

2746
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:26,400
stuff

2747
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,780
it all

2748
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,840
gets back to this one thing

2749
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:33,060
okay and

2750
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:35,820
uh I watched a video a couple I think it

2751
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,100
was a year and a half ago every time you

2752
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,540
watch my videos you get these little

2753
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:42,119
things that pop up as suggestions and uh

2754
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:45,000
Jason Stapleton had one uh up on the

2755
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,739
side here and I I don't know why but

2756
01:46:46,739 --> 01:46:48,840
curiosity this I clicked on it and he

2757
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,219
was talking about the the one thing

2758
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:52,500
you're all looking for that one thing

2759
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,780
and it doesn't exist well that's

2760
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:56,760
 it does exist okay and I'm

2761
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,560
gonna tell you what it is right now the

2762
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,820
one thing is having your alignment

2763
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:05,699
with institutional perspective

2764
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:08,699
but because all of retail trading

2765
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:11,940
Educators teach with a retail mindset

2766
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,159
it's alien to them

2767
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,900
it's alien to them

2768
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,520
and that's why they stay in the

2769
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,219
education capacity they Market they sell

2770
01:47:20,219 --> 01:47:23,040
they make business profits on selling

2771
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,719
education because it's a wonderful

2772
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,600
opportunity to be risk free if they

2773
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,100
don't make money for a subscriber base

2774
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,860
they'll leave but they'll have the PT

2775
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,179
Barnum effect if someone else will come

2776
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:34,619
behind them and believe their horseshit

2777
01:47:34,619 --> 01:47:38,580
okay so they and I'm not trying to just

2778
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,139
pick on Jason it's it's everyone really

2779
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:43,739
the the idea of

2780
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:45,840
sung this idea that there's not this one

2781
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,239
thing because you don't know what it is

2782
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,280
it just shows

2783
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:55,159
with blinding uh you know

2784
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:57,300
Clarity really it's not blinding it's

2785
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,940
Clarity that they don't know what you're

2786
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,080
learning

2787
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:04,199
what I know for certain

2788
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:06,420
there is a

2789
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,860
method

2790
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,219
how these banks operate and it repeats

2791
01:48:11,219 --> 01:48:13,320
all the time

2792
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,420
they're small little variances when it

2793
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,060
comes in and out of effect okay but by

2794
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,500
far and large you're going to see that

2795
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,960
these things repeat themselves all the

2796
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,760
time

2797
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,619
and if you spend your time trying to

2798
01:48:25,619 --> 01:48:27,360
align your thought processes with how

2799
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,100
the banks would want to knock

2800
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,440
individuals out why would they want to

2801
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,540
come back here and run this high if the

2802
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,460
overall premises is going to go lower

2803
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:39,179
because it's going to be for stops

2804
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:41,760
well that means when it's running up

2805
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,980
here like this okay

2806
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,900
maybe you get short

2807
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,420
maybe look for a smaller time frame 15

2808
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,520
minute turtle soup

2809
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,619
over in here

2810
01:48:52,619 --> 01:48:54,739
expect a

2811
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:57,360
unwillingness to continue higher

2812
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,179
but because we saw this idea fleshed out

2813
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:01,619
on a daily chart

2814
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:04,500
it's going to be a lot of range still on

2815
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,360
a five minute chart which is the reason

2816
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,400
why you guys get dusted trading on five

2817
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,960
minute charts without a higher time

2818
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,639
frame premise because the daily chart

2819
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:13,080
can trade a little bit past what you

2820
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,420
think it can on a five minute

2821
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:19,199
and sometimes 100 Pips or more

2822
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,540
but unless you go through the process of

2823
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,699
studying the higher time frame down the

2824
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:25,080
lower time frame not the lower time

2825
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,940
frame up to the higher time frame okay

2826
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,860
it's the higher time frame down to the

2827
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:31,500
lower time frame this is why I say and

2828
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,460
I'm going to make this very clear

2829
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,900
because

2830
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,880
the one person I do respect in this

2831
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,800
industry is Chris Laurie but I've been

2832
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,040
very candid about how I do not like uh

2833
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,440
the trading the volatility against the

2834
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,940
institutional order flow I don't like to

2835
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,159
do that because

2836
01:49:47,159 --> 01:49:49,020
new Traders

2837
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,659
they don't have that understanding and

2838
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:54,739
they are going to invariably take losses

2839
01:49:54,739 --> 01:49:57,360
and while that is

2840
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,860
educational

2841
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,139
by its by its very fact that they're

2842
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:02,100
going to take a loss and they're going

2843
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,840
to hopefully look into why they took a

2844
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,219
loss

2845
01:50:05,219 --> 01:50:07,739
I know that new Traders don't go through

2846
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:10,139
demo trading for months they'd maybe

2847
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:11,699
open up a demo account to see how to put

2848
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:13,619
a buy sell loader in and they made three

2849
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:15,119
thousand dollars in five minutes so now

2850
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:15,780
they're going to put their whole

2851
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:17,159
checking account in their in their

2852
01:50:17,159 --> 01:50:18,360
trading account and they're going to

2853
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:21,480
dust it really quick I don't I just know

2854
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,940
human factor is they're going to rush to

2855
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,340
get into trading live and while I do

2856
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,659
believe the exercise of trading

2857
01:50:27,659 --> 01:50:30,260
volatility is just that it's an exercise

2858
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,780
applied correctly with institutional

2859
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,960
order flow it is wildly wildly

2860
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,280
profitable so I want to make that

2861
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,900
distinction I've said it on record a

2862
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,520
couple different times where some have

2863
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,080
taken and I think Chris maybe one time

2864
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,639
said it in Twitter and I think it was a

2865
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,980
veiled response to me because it says

2866
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:49,920
there's some uh there's some groups that

2867
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,840
say you know we should we shouldn't

2868
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,980
trade this way or don't stand in front

2869
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,300
of a train because that was actually the

2870
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,860
analogy I used I I don't want to stand

2871
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:57,540
in front of a freight train you know if

2872
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:59,940
I'm if I see a primarily bullish Market

2873
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,679
environment I'm sure as hell not trying

2874
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:04,139
to get short in any capacity at all I

2875
01:51:04,139 --> 01:51:05,639
don't want to do that because the

2876
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:07,020
largest expansion is going to be on the

2877
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:08,580
upside and I want to hopefully be

2878
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,920
positioned for that expansion

2879
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,400
so when we look at for our time frames

2880
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,100
okay you can use all those ideas of

2881
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,560
trading volatility uh

2882
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:22,080
liquidity pools and liquidity voids and

2883
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,320
optimal trade entries and stop runs and

2884
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,940
turtle soups all that stuff can be

2885
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:29,100
incorporated but it's best utilized when

2886
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,619
you can ascertain the institutional

2887
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:34,199
order flow okay now watch I'm going to

2888
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:36,119
put this into an example what it means

2889
01:51:36,119 --> 01:51:37,619
and why these levels are highly like

2890
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:39,179
they are

2891
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:40,980
the reason why I like this down candle

2892
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,300
you thought I forgot about it didn't you

2893
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:44,400
the reason why I like this down candle

2894
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,320
is because number one it's a down candle

2895
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,420
which I know is buying on an

2896
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,860
Institutional level

2897
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:53,760
okay and I know that is true after after

2898
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,400
we see the range expansion and it

2899
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,739
engulfs this candle here okay now

2900
01:51:58,739 --> 01:51:59,940
granted you're probably saying well

2901
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,100
that's wonderful it's already moved yeah

2902
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,719
but you're already going to anticipate

2903
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:05,699
it because it's below this old High

2904
01:52:05,699 --> 01:52:08,040
the trend is up it's a daily chart we

2905
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,119
looked at earlier and it showed it was

2906
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,739
moving higher we were just in a larger

2907
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:12,840
consolidation but because we're in

2908
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,940
looking at a four hour time frame

2909
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:17,460
the moves that are going to be around

2910
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:19,139
the levels we're talking about are going

2911
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:21,540
to be dynamic they're going to be

2912
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:23,340
explosive they're going to be Market

2913
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:26,460
maker 12 setups

2914
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,440
what yeah

2915
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:33,440
this is how it works when when you see

2916
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,100
price action on a daily and four hour

2917
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,679
okay you want to know where price is

2918
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,900
going where's the next setup is it going

2919
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,219
to be a big move or is it going to be a

2920
01:52:41,219 --> 01:52:42,840
scalp how do I know if it's a day trade

2921
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,580
and how long how do I know how to hold

2922
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:46,619
on to a move when do I hold on to her

2923
01:52:46,619 --> 01:52:48,480
clothes and when do I hold on to a

2924
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,460
larger price move

2925
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,199
well they are all they're all answered

2926
01:52:52,199 --> 01:52:54,300
with a daily in the four hour

2927
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,239
much the down candle we would have

2928
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,400
anticipated this becoming

2929
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:02,100
a buying opportunity right in here right

2930
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:06,480
when that candle formed right here

2931
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,460
with the expectation that it's going to

2932
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,860
run this high

2933
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,380
why would we expect this High to be ran

2934
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,260
well we almost got equal highs to me I I

2935
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:19,260
call this equal highs okay double tops

2936
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:20,639
okay there's going to be a lot of

2937
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,920
liquidity resting above that by itself

2938
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,239
that's enough

2939
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,100
but what's wonderful is keep going over

2940
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:28,139
here

2941
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:30,719
bingo

2942
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,440
void you can use the low of this candle

2943
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:36,239
or below this one it doesn't make a

2944
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:37,800
difference it's both

2945
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,179
above

2946
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:41,580
or they are both rather above this this

2947
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:44,639
High which is another reason why this is

2948
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,920
going to be expectation for price to

2949
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,580
move and start surging higher okay

2950
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:54,300
price does in fact run through it

2951
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:56,219
continues making a higher high And

2952
01:53:56,219 --> 01:53:58,260
Trades up into a level all this right

2953
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:02,280
here was that bearish daily ICT order

2954
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,900
Block in other words we expected selling

2955
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,420
up in here okay just go back in the

2956
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,460
beginning of the video where I before I

2957
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,480
started talking about all kinds of other

2958
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:12,000
stuff we had all this mapped out for uh

2959
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,400
the 99 50 to 9920 levels remember that

2960
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,800
that's what all this is in here okay and

2961
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,280
then we further marked up this iced tea

2962
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,960
breaker

2963
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,540
watch what happens when price is coming

2964
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:27,179
down say you were fortunate to catch the

2965
01:54:27,179 --> 01:54:29,580
cell in here based on this bullish

2966
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,980
um I'm sorry bearish order block

2967
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:34,080
and you caught this move when price

2968
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,880
trades down into

2969
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,440
that

2970
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,020
you need to take some profits okay take

2971
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:41,760
some profits don't expect it to

2972
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,500
steamroll right on through and keep on

2973
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,360
cutting through all these levels they're

2974
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,219
going to be bounces around there okay

2975
01:54:47,219 --> 01:54:51,300
you need to expect that also notice that

2976
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:54,000
because of this down move okay and then

2977
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,400
price surges away what do you what do

2978
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,780
you apply

2979
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,360
to this model in price

2980
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,460
Market make a cell profile because we

2981
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,440
anticipate a selling an event up here

2982
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,360
but until it can create that sell

2983
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:09,239
scenario up to 99.29 950 level

2984
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:12,119
it's got to trade up to it right so

2985
01:55:12,119 --> 01:55:14,040
overlay Market maker cell profile

2986
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,179
consolidation it rallies away

2987
01:55:17,179 --> 01:55:20,520
reaccumulation smart money reversal low

2988
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,619
risk sell

2989
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:26,340
s off and then redistribution

2990
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:28,080
where is it going to go it's going to

2991
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,239
try to run below these lows it started

2992
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:31,860
the consolidation which led to the

2993
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:33,360
beginning of the market maker cell

2994
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,739
profile

2995
01:55:34,739 --> 01:55:35,880
but

2996
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,739
let me get to this point first

2997
01:55:37,739 --> 01:55:40,199
we know selling off here to likelihood

2998
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:42,119
where is it going to reach for back down

2999
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:43,199
to here

3000
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:45,060
why there's a lot of orders down here

3001
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:47,460
and it's in a primary uptrend still so

3002
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,460
even if this is going to reverse or on a

3003
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,960
longer term scale like we anticipate up

3004
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,980
here

3005
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,139
buying it here and filling in this void

3006
01:55:55,139 --> 01:55:56,040
here

3007
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,440
or returning back to this breaker look

3008
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:02,480
how much look how much range is there

3009
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,460
we're going to use it very high so we're

3010
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,719
going to get the worst case I'm sorry

3011
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:08,520
the best case scenario for

3012
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,560
low entry

3013
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,840
I didn't say that right there the lowest

3014
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,300
potential uh profit let's say it like

3015
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,520
that

3016
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,800
okay all the way up to there it's 84

3017
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,540
Pips

3018
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:24,600
hello 84 Pips who don't want 84 Pips

3019
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,159
I've been doing this a long time I still

3020
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,020
take 84 Pips

3021
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,760
there's an exclusive move

3022
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,940
trades into it you buy it now the rest

3023
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:34,679
of the world isn't going to see that as

3024
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:36,420
a buy they're gonna be like what the

3025
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,900
hell is happening the Dollar's crashing

3026
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:42,060
they're not going to see that as a buy

3027
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:44,400
but when you buy it what are you holding

3028
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,659
for

3029
01:56:45,659 --> 01:56:48,119
a return to the breaker and you're going

3030
01:56:48,119 --> 01:56:49,560
to take some profits there

3031
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,300
do you anticipate continuing trading

3032
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,639
through no why because the 9920 9950

3033
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:56,880
level is a daily bear shoulder block

3034
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,920
so you want to take your profits there

3035
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,719
now guess what you can do you can go

3036
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,100
short

3037
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,719
what's the setup what's the explosive

3038
01:57:03,719 --> 01:57:06,179
Market maker 12 setup in this instance

3039
01:57:06,179 --> 01:57:08,580
selling it at the breaker

3040
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:10,440
reaching for the liquidity below the low

3041
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,739
here

3042
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,500
it's that easy yeah

3043
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,119
that's all it is

3044
01:57:18,119 --> 01:57:21,119
it's all it is why should it do that why

3045
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,280
should you expect it to do this well

3046
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,659
we've already mapped out the idea of the

3047
01:57:24,659 --> 01:57:26,340
breaker why it ran up here it took the

3048
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:28,199
stops overall it's supposed to go lower

3049
01:57:28,199 --> 01:57:30,239
it shows the wellness to go lower this

3050
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:31,679
is a reasonable area to balance why

3051
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,619
because there's old order flow back here

3052
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:37,099
hmm

3053
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,260
sell it but now Watch What Happens

3054
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,239
the orders that they bought here and the

3055
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:43,619
orders they bought here

3056
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:47,219
down here they're underwater

3057
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:48,480
oh

3058
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,580
that's going to be useful isn't it

3059
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,260
how will we use that going forward well

3060
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,239
we'll look at in a second going short

3061
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:57,860
here up at the breaker

3062
01:57:59,159 --> 01:58:01,560
just getting the old low down here it's

3063
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:05,940
97 Pips so we have 84 and 97. basically

3064
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,679
200 Pips

3065
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,119
two setups

3066
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:10,619
one market

3067
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:15,260
all inside of a day or two

3068
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,940
the market runs down

3069
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,440
below the low

3070
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,179
and comes back up

3071
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:27,300
trades in the body of the candle here

3072
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,119
sells off what is it going to reach for

3073
01:58:30,119 --> 01:58:33,179
what it's going to reach for so

3074
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:35,219
remember the last couple live sessions I

3075
01:58:35,219 --> 01:58:36,960
did last I think it was last week I'm so

3076
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,219
out of touch I don't know if it was last

3077
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:40,380
week or week four but I did a couple uh

3078
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:43,020
live sessions and uh

3079
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:45,719
I taught that there's primary questions

3080
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:47,940
you need to ask it starts with two of

3081
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,099
them really where is the where's fair

3082
01:58:50,099 --> 01:58:51,540
market value

3083
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:54,060
and whereas institutional overflow most

3084
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:55,440
likely going to take you to where's

3085
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:59,040
liquidity okay well price had been going

3086
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,639
higher right

3087
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,340
So Below this low

3088
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,460
is where stocks will be resting

3089
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:10,380
once we cleared out this area here of

3090
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:12,540
this order block

3091
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,820
it's been violated here the only other

3092
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:18,119
level of liquidity

3093
01:59:18,119 --> 01:59:20,460
below the market is here

3094
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:22,920
you do have this bearish candle which is

3095
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,900
of ICD bullish order block but you have

3096
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,760
to look at it in context of where we are

3097
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:29,219
on the grand scheme of things because up

3098
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:30,840
here we framed out the idea that the

3099
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,000
daily suggesting lower prices

3100
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,960
so these bullish ICT or order blocks or

3101
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,300
down cameras prior to up moves should do

3102
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,219
what should they hold

3103
01:59:41,219 --> 01:59:43,619
or should they fail

3104
01:59:43,619 --> 01:59:45,000
they should fail

3105
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,920
because the higher time frame daily is

3106
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,619
going to have a lot more effect on and

3107
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:51,000
we're going to talk about this in the

3108
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,239
cable trade as a closer the this should

3109
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,360
fail so it gives you a little bit of

3110
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:58,920
prognostication value when you're

3111
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,540
looking at order blocks when should you

3112
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:01,800
look at a particular order block over

3113
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,980
another well the idea of 99 29 950 up

3114
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:06,900
here on a daily is suggesting lower

3115
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:07,920
prices

3116
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,940
and we gave up a key level here okay

3117
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,860
because this is this is crucial because

3118
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:15,960
we took out this level here with it and

3119
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:18,060
we violated it here then we're unable to

3120
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,380
get back above the bodies of the candle

3121
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:23,219
here mitigated and then traded down we

3122
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:25,380
blew the liquidity out here took out the

3123
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:27,060
uh the stops

3124
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,320
so where would the next level of

3125
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,099
liquidity be

3126
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,659
below these lows

3127
02:00:36,659 --> 02:00:40,619
equal lows okay so when price starts to

3128
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:43,739
Rally up what's it rallying up to well

3129
02:00:43,739 --> 02:00:45,179
we went back to this level here

3130
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:47,880
mitigated old High

3131
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:50,400
should there be a a selling indication

3132
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,679
well we'll see price starts to slide

3133
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:54,719
down okay so now we have indications

3134
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:56,639
that they're selling more so go back to

3135
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:58,320
the up candle now here's where we got

3136
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,719
that same uh question earlier

3137
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:02,280
Michael when do you use the bottom of

3138
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,860
the candle the wick or the body of the

3139
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:07,080
candle when do you do that well let me

3140
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,420
ask you a question looking at this

3141
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,860
candle

3142
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:13,020
is this a big beefy candle or is it a

3143
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,699
small bodied candle

3144
02:01:14,699 --> 02:01:16,440
clearly it's a big beefy candle it's a

3145
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,300
big body candle so this is when you use

3146
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:20,400
the body

3147
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,000
and you use the the middle of it okay

3148
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,739
the mean threshold

3149
02:01:25,739 --> 02:01:27,360
you take your line

3150
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,940
you draw it on there

3151
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:33,599
right there okay see that it's the

3152
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,400
Midway point of the body not the wick

3153
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,659
the wick that's not what we're looking

3154
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:38,460
at here guys we're looking at the body

3155
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,320
of the candle and it's right in the

3156
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,060
middle okay so let me highlight that

3157
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,500
it's a little bit of a different color

3158
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,060
because I want to make a strong

3159
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:47,520
distinction between it and

3160
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,320
the other lines I have on here that I

3161
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:51,739
don't want to remove

3162
02:01:52,219 --> 02:01:57,139
uh yeah it's just gonna have to work

3163
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:06,659
all right so price shows a willing to

3164
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:08,699
sell off here so now our thinking is

3165
02:02:08,699 --> 02:02:12,239
this they sold it here above the halfway

3166
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:15,060
point is liquidity that's too thin don't

3167
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:17,340
expect that to be rated back into okay

3168
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:20,099
expect the Middle Point down to the

3169
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:22,500
bottom of the candle okay so what am I

3170
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,619
saying I'm saying that we need to take

3171
02:02:25,619 --> 02:02:29,360
this into consideration

3172
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,480
all right

3173
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:48,179
there and that's how your bearish order

3174
02:02:48,179 --> 02:02:49,320
block

3175
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:52,380
would be based on this Market

3176
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:54,300
action in here

3177
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,739
let's take this

3178
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:57,840
save off

3179
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,580
so when price trades back up into it

3180
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,260
this is where you sell right there where

3181
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:04,020
do you sell that well the low on this

3182
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,320
candle

3183
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,080
low comes in at 98.19 well right away we

3184
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,780
know 9820 is inside that range those

3185
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:16,260
institutional level 98.20 we got 98 30

3186
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:20,599
small round number and we got 98.40

3187
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:24,659
you see we highlighted 98.43 okay so we

3188
02:03:24,659 --> 02:03:29,159
could sell at 9840 98 30 and 98 20.

3189
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:30,960
depends on what you want to find on a

3190
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,239
smaller time frame dropping down in the

3191
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:34,739
smaller time frames you'd have all kinds

3192
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:37,560
of other setups but in here that would

3193
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,540
be the cell right there

3194
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:42,540
okay and what do you reach for

3195
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:45,000
where's the where's the where's the two

3196
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,920
things I ask you or instructed you

3197
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,040
rather to look for when you're selling

3198
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:51,780
or buying rather when you're looking for

3199
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,980
your setups

3200
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:55,199
where's liquidity

3201
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,060
where's fair market value

3202
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,860
liquidity is where the Market's going to

3203
02:03:58,860 --> 02:03:59,820
be drawn

3204
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:01,980
based on institutional order flow it's

3205
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,780
going to seek out liquidity and where's

3206
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,219
fair market value

3207
02:04:05,219 --> 02:04:07,880
okay watch

3208
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:14,040
the down candle probably this upswing

3209
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,020
that led into the cell in here

3210
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:19,920
that's fair market value right there

3211
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,260
price you sell here

3212
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,960
you get out down here

3213
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,060
simple enough

3214
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:28,199
now

3215
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:30,060
if you have a strong conviction that

3216
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:32,760
this is going to be a longer term High

3217
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,320
you would just take some profits here

3218
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,719
and leave someone but because we're in

3219
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:39,599
what primary uptrend or downtrend on a

3220
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:40,380
dollar

3221
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:41,880
are you trying to catch reversals and

3222
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,679
held for the very high and hold it for a

3223
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:45,659
multi-year that may be what you want to

3224
02:04:45,659 --> 02:04:47,159
do I don't do that

3225
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:49,139
you got to be aware that there may be

3226
02:04:49,139 --> 02:04:52,500
another deeper legged buying opportunity

3227
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,239
for the dollar and I've been calling

3228
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,099
dollar five dollar dollar two dollar

3229
02:04:56,099 --> 02:04:59,580
five on the Greenback for over a year

3230
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:01,920
and I still believe it's possible to

3231
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:02,820
happen

3232
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:04,320
so

3233
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:09,440
looking at that sung in here this is the

3234
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:13,619
selling it up here we'll use the 30

3235
02:05:13,619 --> 02:05:15,980
level

3236
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,260
halfway of that range

3237
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:21,179
and just getting down to this level here

3238
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:24,420
is 80 Pips it's a little hard to see it

3239
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:27,599
yeah right there 80 Pips right there so

3240
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,080
again explosive price action

3241
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,540
trades down and then look what happens

3242
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:36,060
it trades back One More Time Boom

3243
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:38,340
take a look inside this beefy candle now

3244
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,780
again are we going to look at the bottom

3245
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:42,000
of the candle and use the wick only or

3246
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,500
are we going to do what

3247
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:45,659
are we going to break down the mean

3248
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,119
threshold

3249
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:51,119
big beefy bodies we do what we measure

3250
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:55,040
the range of the body of the candle

3251
02:05:56,099 --> 02:05:58,320
you don't see this anywhere else

3252
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,179
so it's not repackaged it's not

3253
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:01,619
regurgitated

3254
02:06:01,619 --> 02:06:05,540
and then you take your line

3255
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,139
place it right on the 50 level which is

3256
02:06:10,139 --> 02:06:11,639
all I did was highlighted again on the

3257
02:06:11,639 --> 02:06:13,020
FIB level

3258
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:15,119
uh calibrated it just to show

3259
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:17,820
equilibrium thank you Peter for showing

3260
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:19,860
me that I spelled or misspelled

3261
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:22,560
equilibrium wrong

3262
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,520
the uh

3263
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,619
the price action moves right up here now

3264
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:30,420
look at the buys it it goes just a

3265
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:31,679
little bit past

3266
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:34,139
the halfway point but look how it

3267
02:06:34,139 --> 02:06:36,300
respects it now yes it Wicks through it

3268
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,580
I'm not going to argue that it can do

3269
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:40,679
this we said this before it can do that

3270
02:06:40,679 --> 02:06:43,139
but the bulk of the volume which is

3271
02:06:43,139 --> 02:06:46,020
always indicative and seen through the

3272
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:48,000
bodies of the candle not the Wicks the

3273
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,440
Wicks are going to always be the

3274
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,659
thinnest price action it's reaching for

3275
02:06:51,659 --> 02:06:53,760
stops

3276
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,820
this High here it runs through it and

3277
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:01,440
then rejects it see that now

3278
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,659
when you see this the next question is

3279
02:07:03,659 --> 02:07:06,179
what is this a liquidity void

3280
02:07:06,179 --> 02:07:08,040
from the low down here when it started

3281
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:09,780
running up like we did here we did this

3282
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:11,280
buying opportunity here where it runs up

3283
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,460
we are in

3284
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,980
a consolidation okay so the question is

3285
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:19,920
did we blow through these highs no we

3286
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,119
weren't able to blow through the highs

3287
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:22,980
it's starting to break down so the

3288
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:26,340
question is what where's liquidity

3289
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:28,260
below the lows

3290
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:30,659
so mark it if you sell it here you want

3291
02:07:30,659 --> 02:07:32,280
to reach for a move going below these

3292
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,440
lows the market will look to take that

3293
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:37,020
liquidity out

3294
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:38,880
that's these loads right here

3295
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,739
and it does it right there

3296
02:07:40,739 --> 02:07:43,619
then this rundown to get those stops

3297
02:07:43,619 --> 02:07:47,480
creates an opportunity

3298
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,300
of candle inside of this void

3299
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:54,599
price comes back up trades up into what

3300
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:57,659
small little bodied candle it's not a

3301
02:07:57,659 --> 02:07:59,520
big beefy one right we don't even use

3302
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:02,520
the FED now we do what we use the wick

3303
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:05,340
to the body of the candle

3304
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:07,080
I already see some of you smiling

3305
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,840
already oh it's making sense now

3306
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,280
see that aren't you glad you paid for

3307
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,900
this with PayPal

3308
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:15,300
best money ever spent

3309
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,179
trades right up into

3310
02:08:18,179 --> 02:08:21,300
the dynamic resistance

3311
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:23,400
this ICT Parish order block right in

3312
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,179
here Midway point of it in fact also and

3313
02:08:27,179 --> 02:08:28,980
sells off

3314
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:32,900
wonderful isn't it so

3315
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,780
you have to have a storyline behind what

3316
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:37,980
it is that you're trading and why you're

3317
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:41,880
trading it you got to be looking for the

3318
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,040
liquidity in the marketplace like the

3319
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,599
banks do because they're pushing price

3320
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:47,520
and they're buying and selling the drive

3321
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:50,040
price on a short term to manipulate

3322
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,320
price action okay because they know by

3323
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,300
and large if they manipulate price to a

3324
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:56,340
certain price level they they know

3325
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:57,119
there's going to be a whole lot of

3326
02:08:57,119 --> 02:09:00,900
injection of action okay and that will

3327
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:03,239
drive their price moves further they may

3328
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:06,840
have more uh interest to sell higher but

3329
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:09,239
they'll buy short term to push price up

3330
02:09:09,239 --> 02:09:12,300
just so the market price will print at

3331
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:15,239
that level knowing that the funds which

3332
02:09:15,239 --> 02:09:17,400
you stops

3333
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,780
will be triggered into the marketplace

3334
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:20,219
or out of the marketplace respectively

3335
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:22,199
and giving in the counterparty to the

3336
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:24,840
trade the smart money or Banks do not

3337
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:30,000
see your stops okay I am not teaching or

3338
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,099
have nowhere have I ever seen myself

3339
02:09:32,099 --> 02:09:36,060
ever present a a a a case that the banks

3340
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:39,480
see your retail stop in fxcm they don't

3341
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:41,219
they don't see oh and does they don't

3342
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:44,400
see etoro they don't see whatever else

3343
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,679
uh you know these retail Brokers have

3344
02:09:46,679 --> 02:09:49,020
because they're outside that inner Bank

3345
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:50,400
level they're inside of a small little

3346
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:53,460
children's pool of liquidity and there's

3347
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:55,739
a big vast ocean out there that great

3348
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:59,099
big old sharks uh swimming and they know

3349
02:09:59,099 --> 02:10:00,659
that

3350
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,119
the seals they hang out on those little

3351
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:04,860
icebergs and they're going to be right

3352
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:06,480
above the highs and right below the lows

3353
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:08,040
and that's where the stops are and

3354
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:09,179
they're just going to come in there's

3355
02:10:09,179 --> 02:10:11,699
like a killer whale they'll run up on it

3356
02:10:11,699 --> 02:10:14,400
and knock them off and just eat them so

3357
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,400
either you either elect to be a killer

3358
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,980
whale or you stay a seal there it is

3359
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:22,560
there's your analogy for today so let's

3360
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,179
take a look at the cable and wrap this

3361
02:10:24,179 --> 02:10:25,619
up because my stomach's ground I'm

3362
02:10:25,619 --> 02:10:27,840
hungry

3363
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,679
um

3364
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:30,679
surprise surprise the cable's lower

3365
02:10:30,679 --> 02:10:33,900
unless uh not sure how that happened

3366
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:37,020
maybe because uh we said it was going to

3367
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:38,099
happen

3368
02:10:38,099 --> 02:10:40,739
arrogance

3369
02:10:40,739 --> 02:10:43,380
all right so we have the cable

3370
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:45,540
running lower let's take a look at what

3371
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,880
I shared on Twitter real quick just for

3372
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:49,560
continuity's sake before we get into it

3373
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:54,060
I shared a couple levels on

3374
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:55,739
Twitter

3375
02:10:55,739 --> 02:10:59,580
indicating specific lows and the low

3376
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:02,639
comes in at 142.29

3377
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:04,739
on this candle right here let me make

3378
02:11:04,739 --> 02:11:07,760
sure I'm getting the right one

3379
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:14,540
yeah 4229 is the low

3380
02:11:17,099 --> 02:11:19,020
oh man I'm not going to get it like that

3381
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:21,980
I'm gonna set it up

3382
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,739
I can't see your comments but I promise

3383
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:27,540
I will scroll through it later on to see

3384
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:28,500
it

3385
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:29,340
um

3386
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:30,900
but I'm hoping that you guys are

3387
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:33,360
learning something today because this is

3388
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,340
really it really is higher level stuff I

3389
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,860
mean when you when you learn these types

3390
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:39,780
of things it's not indicator based it's

3391
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,820
not mathematically derived it's the

3392
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:43,920
psychology of the marketplace and the

3393
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,659
institutions are the marketplace retail

3394
02:11:45,659 --> 02:11:48,900
is not we're fleas on a big dog so

3395
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:51,179
there are the two levels that I tweeted

3396
02:11:51,179 --> 02:11:55,800
um 142.29 and 135 10 respectively these

3397
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,480
are the levels here and because we were

3398
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:59,940
in what type of Market profile what what

3399
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:01,800
Market profile is this

3400
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:05,460
is it range bound trending reversal

3401
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,440
which one is it

3402
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,020
range bound so in a consolidating market

3403
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:12,540
like this the market will do what it

3404
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:15,239
will seek liquidity above and below the

3405
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:17,219
marketplace well we saw that happen here

3406
02:12:17,219 --> 02:12:19,380
it took out the old highs

3407
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:21,239
and we traded down took out these equal

3408
02:12:21,239 --> 02:12:22,920
lows and then look at the nicer reaction

3409
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,960
here this is a monthly chart

3410
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,119
okay it took liquidity out and then

3411
02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:29,760
rallied up several months and then roll

3412
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,199
back down

3413
02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:33,179
see that

3414
02:12:33,179 --> 02:12:36,119
look closely what do you see there right

3415
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:37,679
in here what do you see right in here

3416
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:38,639
now I'm going to go to the questions

3417
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:39,960
section because I'm going to see if you

3418
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,219
guys are actually saying anything here

3419
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:44,159
that answers my inquiry

3420
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:47,460
whoa It's got some long-winded uh

3421
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:50,520
so uh I definitely will have to read

3422
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:51,960
some of these statements after we close

3423
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:54,119
this a lot of there's a lot of them

3424
02:12:54,119 --> 02:12:55,679
um

3425
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,860
foreign

3426
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:07,040
and if you look at hang on one second

3427
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:51,239
okay sorry about that my

3428
02:13:51,239 --> 02:13:54,000
16 year old just came home

3429
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,719
from school he does a part-time

3430
02:13:57,719 --> 02:13:59,820
works his job that he has to have for

3431
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:01,440
credit and then he has

3432
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,480
two classes in a day so he comes home

3433
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:05,159
midday

3434
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:06,780
I just want to make sure he didn't come

3435
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:09,480
in and Holland so

3436
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:12,119
we have a consolidating market okay and

3437
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:15,060
we saw price take out the highs here let

3438
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,920
me just throw that up so you can see how

3439
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,659
it was

3440
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:22,980
very good indication of a turtle soup

3441
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:25,560
comes up blip hits it and rolls back

3442
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,239
down what is it going to reach for

3443
02:14:27,239 --> 02:14:30,060
liquidity and fair market value

3444
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:33,360
okay so price cleans out these areas

3445
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,400
stops and then it bounces up where is it

3446
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,560
bouncing up to

3447
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,659
well ain't going all the way up here

3448
02:14:39,659 --> 02:14:40,860
there's no need for it to do that

3449
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:42,739
because it gave a

3450
02:14:42,739 --> 02:14:45,119
reversal inside of the consolidation

3451
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:48,659
okay because they the profiles can nest

3452
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:50,579
we have a consolidation it takes out the

3453
02:14:50,579 --> 02:14:51,960
stops

3454
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:53,880
okay and then it runs down if it's

3455
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,400
reaching down for liquidity below the

3456
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,020
marketplace it does it here

3457
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,820
but there's no necessity for it to come

3458
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,980
back up to that

3459
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:05,000
but look close

3460
02:15:07,139 --> 02:15:11,420
look real close in here what do you see

3461
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:19,560
I'm actually waiting for a response from

3462
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:21,980
some of you

3463
02:15:28,679 --> 02:15:31,560
see that

3464
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:34,260
this is the same thing that it just

3465
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,460
described in the dollar

3466
02:15:38,579 --> 02:15:41,219
see the old high here

3467
02:15:41,219 --> 02:15:44,880
down candle right below the old High

3468
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,099
see that

3469
02:15:47,099 --> 02:15:49,199
what's smart money doing here obviously

3470
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:51,060
in hindsight we can see it but if you go

3471
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,980
back in my market reviews we were

3472
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:55,199
calling this thing higher all along

3473
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:56,820
and it's all on video and I know you

3474
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:58,380
guys have them recorded and downloaded

3475
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:00,900
your computers call me on

3476
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,699
Twitter if I'm not being honest but I'm

3477
02:16:02,699 --> 02:16:04,079
telling you we were we were long all

3478
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:05,760
through here and calling for this old

3479
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,560
High

3480
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:09,420
but the smart money is buying on the

3481
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,400
down move like that okay this is a

3482
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:14,579
monthly candle a down candle okay so the

3483
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:16,920
buy orders that they have here have to

3484
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,020
be mitigated if it's going to go lower

3485
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:21,840
they bought it this is how long term no

3486
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,179
stop loss holding type thing they held

3487
02:16:24,179 --> 02:16:26,579
onto this position it multi-year

3488
02:16:26,579 --> 02:16:29,219
multi-year

3489
02:16:29,219 --> 02:16:30,480
you're not going to hear this stuff

3490
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,459
taught in retail circuits

3491
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:34,138
because they don't know it

3492
02:16:34,138 --> 02:16:37,580
Banks can sit on Long Long positions

3493
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:40,320
macro view perspectives okay they can

3494
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,840
sit on those positions they're hedging

3495
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:44,879
that's one of the benefits they had that

3496
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:46,978
we can't do that in America we can't

3497
02:16:46,978 --> 02:16:50,040
Hedge because once people knew that they

3498
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:52,978
could trade like this you never lost

3499
02:16:52,978 --> 02:16:54,660
you never took a loss

3500
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,580
not a net loss let's put it that way I

3501
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:58,320
mean Physicians would be underwater but

3502
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,939
eventually you could even work your way

3503
02:16:59,939 --> 02:17:02,040
out of it

3504
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:04,320
the breaker right in here

3505
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:06,478
trades right back up into it here

3506
02:17:06,478 --> 02:17:08,700
rolls over and then does what reaches

3507
02:17:08,700 --> 02:17:09,959
for the liquidity below the market here

3508
02:17:09,959 --> 02:17:12,959
and ultimately it still and is Will

3509
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:15,359
going to take out the low here and if it

3510
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:16,740
gets a lot of steam

3511
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:20,160
which I expect a very I personally

3512
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:22,859
expect a bounce of significance in here

3513
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:24,299
I think it's going to be a sharp

3514
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:26,638
reaction when it Trace that level but if

3515
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,200
it continues to just mow right on

3516
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:30,299
through it it's going to aim for this

3517
02:17:30,299 --> 02:17:33,539
low 135.02

3518
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:37,558
uh what am I saying 135 is it 135.2

3519
02:17:37,558 --> 02:17:39,179
I don't think I did

3520
02:17:39,179 --> 02:17:42,718
the price level on that below 13503 so

3521
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:44,519
yeah I have

3522
02:17:44,519 --> 02:17:47,820
to set this 13503

3523
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:49,320
at least for this feed you'll have to do

3524
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:52,880
it for your own individual platforms

3525
02:17:53,638 --> 02:17:55,679
to get your uh

3526
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:58,679
your platforms uh price feed for that

3527
02:17:58,679 --> 02:18:01,920
particular level I'm referring to is the

3528
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:06,439
January low of 2009 and in the low of

3529
02:18:06,439 --> 02:18:09,718
May 2010 or the two levels that I

3530
02:18:09,718 --> 02:18:12,478
suspect that cable is gunning for okay

3531
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:15,058
and

3532
02:18:15,058 --> 02:18:18,678
um looking at a weekly chart

3533
02:18:24,299 --> 02:18:26,580
okay

3534
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:29,340
we see price

3535
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,320
let me get this I got I'm not I'm if

3536
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:32,340
you're saying anything I'm not gonna be

3537
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:33,780
able to see it so I will open up the

3538
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:35,280
window in a minute where you're

3539
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:36,540
commenting or questioning but I can't

3540
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:39,718
see it for the next couple minutes

3541
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:42,379
Z

3542
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:45,120
equal lows in here

3543
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:47,638
okay price sweat below it you can see

3544
02:18:47,638 --> 02:18:49,620
that very handsomely done here and one

3545
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:51,359
more run below the low it created here

3546
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:54,058
and rallied up rather aggressively where

3547
02:18:54,058 --> 02:18:56,099
is it reaching for

3548
02:18:56,099 --> 02:18:59,000
fair market value

3549
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,558
sell off

3550
02:19:01,558 --> 02:19:03,299
big candle

3551
02:19:03,299 --> 02:19:05,099
use the middle of the candle mean

3552
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:06,959
threshold

3553
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:09,260
sell off

3554
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:12,359
small little body candle prior to the

3555
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:14,760
big move what do you use the wick to the

3556
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:16,320
body

3557
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:18,179
sell off

3558
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:20,340
small little body candle

3559
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:22,200
for the big move down what do you use

3560
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:25,138
the body to the wick extend that out in

3561
02:19:25,138 --> 02:19:26,939
time you see all that distribution in

3562
02:19:26,939 --> 02:19:30,840
here sells off okay we have

3563
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:32,760
a small body candle

3564
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:35,760
right before a big candle here use the

3565
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:37,558
wick to the body

3566
02:19:37,558 --> 02:19:39,420
sell off

3567
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:41,459
price runs down and starts to break hard

3568
02:19:41,459 --> 02:19:43,799
taking out the lows here and reaching

3569
02:19:43,799 --> 02:19:47,700
for the liquidity resting at 140 29. we

3570
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:50,540
go down to a

3571
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,979
hang on I gotta remember what what I was

3572
02:19:55,979 --> 02:19:58,020
gonna say about this hold on

3573
02:19:58,020 --> 02:20:00,000
oh the most recent Traders did in uh

3574
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,140
cable good grief

3575
02:20:04,859 --> 02:20:07,760
here's the daily

3576
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,640
okay and price

3577
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:16,080
um we talked about being selling or or

3578
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,840
a selling scenario up in here

3579
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:20,939
okay if you look at the beginning of

3580
02:20:20,939 --> 02:20:24,359
December I gave you I believe it was a

3581
02:20:24,359 --> 02:20:26,340
live session

3582
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:27,720
I know it's recorded because it's it's

3583
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:30,540
out there but we were talking about

3584
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,640
um the market going lower here

3585
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:34,500
okay and potentially reaching down into

3586
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,300
this order block and whether we have the

3587
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,700
the momentum to go through this low or

3588
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,500
not would be have to be seen at that

3589
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,899
time I think it's the exit uh

3590
02:20:42,899 --> 02:20:45,240
term I used and the way I was describing

3591
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:47,100
it and obviously you can see it just

3592
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:50,100
rolling in this steamrolling down I went

3593
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:54,060
short make sure I've got a price here

3594
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:56,660
I sold it and

3595
02:20:56,660 --> 02:20:59,729
[Music]

3596
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:09,000
yeah I had a New York

3597
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,420
session trade selling short

3598
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:14,000
at

3599
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,740
143.92

3600
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:21,060
143.92 so let's go into a

3601
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:24,500
15 minute time frame

3602
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,160
and

3603
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:33,000
show you

3604
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,819
what I want to show you

3605
02:21:35,819 --> 02:21:38,819
143.92

3606
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:49,260
now I don't have this mt4 demo account

3607
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:51,000
linked to the one to my effects

3608
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,380
otherwise I could just very easily just

3609
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:55,200
pop it up there the one I I use that for

3610
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,680
I do it with my iPhone so I'm just going

3611
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:00,660
to go through the myfx book and confirm

3612
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:02,640
everything I'm showing you is based on

3613
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:05,100
what what you see here

3614
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,979
so uh where are we at

3615
02:22:07,979 --> 02:22:09,979
um

3616
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:17,000
and

3617
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:20,340
1307.

3618
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:38,000
all right

3619
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:44,060
and that's on the wrong day

3620
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:09,840
okay and

3621
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:16,260
time is right here indicated by the

3622
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:17,580
arrow

3623
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:21,080
and we maximum

3624
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:23,819
I don't know it could I mean I'm not

3625
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:25,260
saying it will but I'd like to see it

3626
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,580
drive down and hit that level live

3627
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,319
that'd be awesome that's a little bit of

3628
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:30,359
a range today not that it can't do it

3629
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:31,200
but

3630
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:32,700
still reaching

3631
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:35,460
so we're in London close now so it may

3632
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:39,060
not have the gas to do it but we have uh

3633
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:41,100
price trading right in here okay and now

3634
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:43,500
once you look close this is the candle

3635
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:47,160
right in here I traded to that right

3636
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,520
there

3637
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:54,680
the big one that rallied up real strong

3638
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,680
let me zoom in

3639
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,600
my stomach is really really growling I

3640
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,520
didn't eat breakfast today and I'm

3641
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:04,439
regretting it now

3642
02:24:04,439 --> 02:24:07,800
so here's the candle uh

3643
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,280
right

3644
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:15,240
good grief

3645
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:16,800
here it is

3646
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,859
okay this is the candle I went in a long

3647
02:24:19,859 --> 02:24:20,939
one

3648
02:24:20,939 --> 02:24:22,620
and I want you to look at what you see

3649
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:24,859
here

3650
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,960
zoom in one more time because

3651
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:30,540
this is very very important

3652
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:33,420
we have this big rally up

3653
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,760
okay big old rally

3654
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:38,280
and price comes back down and slams

3655
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:40,740
right into this what is this now let me

3656
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:43,920
pull up the question segment up

3657
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:47,000
I forgot to take this off

3658
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:54,540
okay right in here price comes back down

3659
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:56,640
into this liquidity void right here and

3660
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:59,700
fills the range from here all the way up

3661
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:01,260
here it comes right back down in other

3662
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:04,100
words it looks like this

3663
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:07,920
there's the range

3664
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:11,340
explodes up takes out the stops here

3665
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:13,620
rallies a little bit more

3666
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:16,380
and then starts coming back down okay

3667
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:19,620
and slams right into it

3668
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:22,680
there right there okay

3669
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:24,899
right in this candle

3670
02:25:24,899 --> 02:25:28,859
okay I'm thinking now

3671
02:25:28,859 --> 02:25:32,220
there's a tug of war on the setups

3672
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:34,260
this time frame is a 15 minute time

3673
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:36,180
frame

3674
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:37,920
okay and it's exactly what I had on my

3675
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:40,100
phone

3676
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:42,780
Mike I'm I know I'm not saying I bought

3677
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:44,580
it I never said that I bought it I'm

3678
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:46,859
explaining something in contrast so you

3679
02:25:46,859 --> 02:25:48,720
know the benefits of why I did what I

3680
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:51,060
did I never said I bought it

3681
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:52,920
the uh

3682
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:55,859
the the market rallied up here okay and

3683
02:25:55,859 --> 02:25:57,300
it came right back down into this level

3684
02:25:57,300 --> 02:26:00,260
right here what is this

3685
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:05,479
what's this candle right here

3686
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:14,580
bullish shoulder block

3687
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:16,800
no problem no problem I appreciate your

3688
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:19,080
enthusiasm though

3689
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,479
the the fact that we saw a rally up like

3690
02:26:21,479 --> 02:26:24,720
this okay and a down candle

3691
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:27,600
in normal market conditions okay if this

3692
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:30,540
is a bullish environment this exact this

3693
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:32,280
is exactly what you would expect to be a

3694
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:34,500
buyer okay this is exactly how you'd

3695
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:37,380
handle it it's in New York open okay

3696
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:41,460
it's a wonderful setup and I I went in

3697
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:44,100
with the idea shown and it's one of the

3698
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:47,040
exercises I also teach that you have to

3699
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:50,939
test one quarter block against another

3700
02:26:50,939 --> 02:26:52,080
order block

3701
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:54,180
and this is the only way you you start

3702
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:56,280
to appreciate the higher time frame okay

3703
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:58,140
we're going to look at the higher time

3704
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,000
frame in respect to what we're showing

3705
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,920
here but I want you to see what I traded

3706
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,680
short right into on a very very short

3707
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:08,040
term this was screaming a buy

3708
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:10,680
but it was a very short-term time frame

3709
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:11,580
set up

3710
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:13,080
nonetheless it could have paid out

3711
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:16,500
handsomely but it's still a short-term

3712
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,399
setup

3713
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:19,200
I went short

3714
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:23,040
rate at the time it was most bullish on

3715
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,560
a very short-term basis

3716
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:28,640
watch what takes place

3717
02:27:36,859 --> 02:27:39,420
rallies off strong

3718
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:42,319
where's liquidity

3719
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:46,140
above the high right does everyone agree

3720
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:47,580
that the liquidity would be above these

3721
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:51,200
highs or this High rather

3722
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:58,640
I'm waiting for your response

3723
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:40,160
you guys there

3724
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:48,200
you still there

3725
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:55,200
[Music]

3726
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,460
can I get an audio check

3727
02:29:02,819 --> 02:29:06,319
you guys there hello hello

3728
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,080
can you guys hear me

3729
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,000
waiting for a response from one of you

3730
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,020
guys to let me know

3731
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:26,160
thank you very much I'm not sure what

3732
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:27,660
just happened we had our lights this

3733
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:29,520
Flicker and that connect our connection

3734
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:35,300
from Comcast this was briefly cut

3735
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:37,500
okay so I'm not sure how that's going to

3736
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:39,420
affect the recording but if we're still

3737
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:40,979
talking

3738
02:29:40,979 --> 02:29:43,260
um let me make sure it's still going

3739
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:44,580
yeah it's still recording so you didn't

3740
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:45,780
miss anything

3741
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:49,040
all right so uh

3742
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:53,040
as price is running up do we agree that

3743
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,899
as prices rallying liquidity is going to

3744
02:29:54,899 --> 02:29:57,740
be above the high here

3745
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,760
right so we know price is most likely

3746
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:04,620
going to run up try to reach for this

3747
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:06,800
high

3748
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:11,359
and

3749
02:30:11,399 --> 02:30:14,280
price runs and takes out the high right

3750
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:15,359
here

3751
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:17,399
I sat through all this

3752
02:30:17,399 --> 02:30:20,399
without a stop loss order okay without

3753
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,560
any protection whatsoever and no limit

3754
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:25,200
order for profit objective

3755
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,819
this is one of the things I want you to

3756
02:30:26,819 --> 02:30:28,140
do as well in your demo account this is

3757
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:29,880
how you use the demo account okay you

3758
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:32,460
want to see the effects of buying and

3759
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:34,439
selling at higher time frame and lower

3760
02:30:34,439 --> 02:30:35,819
time frame

3761
02:30:35,819 --> 02:30:37,620
order blocks and you'll see the

3762
02:30:37,620 --> 02:30:40,140
reactions of it okay and by doing that

3763
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:42,060
it will give you

3764
02:30:42,060 --> 02:30:45,899
input that you'll use for future trades

3765
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:47,520
and either a demo account if you're

3766
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,140
still on the development stage or in

3767
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:50,520
live Trading

3768
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:53,460
my question is this how could this be

3769
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:56,700
used as positive reinforcement

3770
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:58,920
even though it's in a demo account

3771
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:02,960
how is this beneficial to you

3772
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,960
by taking an exercise like this

3773
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:12,479
and being short here how's that

3774
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:14,880
beneficial to you seeing something like

3775
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,439
this when it runs out like that how

3776
02:31:16,439 --> 02:31:19,580
would that be beneficial

3777
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,240
well yeah Nino that's good trusting okay

3778
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:32,460
trusting that uh

3779
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:34,979
um you're able to see reactions and and

3780
02:31:34,979 --> 02:31:37,200
moves before you happen Okay but more

3781
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,960
importantly if you do get caught up and

3782
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:42,180
you take a trade and it starts to scream

3783
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:45,240
against you you have to know where it's

3784
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:46,979
most likely going to reach for and if

3785
02:31:46,979 --> 02:31:50,720
you're able to take the risk on

3786
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:53,640
if you're able to take the risk on

3787
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:56,760
and weather that okay and this is

3788
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:58,260
another reason why you keep your risk

3789
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:00,000
small because if you're only risking a

3790
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,859
half percent or one percent

3791
02:32:01,859 --> 02:32:04,920
you're still within the uh the realm of

3792
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:07,260
absorbing something like this now the

3793
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:08,760
question is do you continue holding on

3794
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:11,399
to it if it's rallying on through it no

3795
02:32:11,399 --> 02:32:14,280
but if you are willing to absorb

3796
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:16,740
the move up to here and still stick to

3797
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:18,600
your overall convictions that it's going

3798
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:19,859
to trade lower

3799
02:32:19,859 --> 02:32:22,140
this is what you would this is what you

3800
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:24,420
would take from it okay but I want to

3801
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,340
show you the contrast between seeing a

3802
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,740
short-term 15-minute bearish candle

3803
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:30,479
which is a bullish order block seeing

3804
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:32,580
the reactions of it like that but still

3805
02:32:32,580 --> 02:32:35,960
staying in the move

3806
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,420
yes Brian you could have you could have

3807
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:42,000
sold here on a turtle soup yes

3808
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,800
Okay so

3809
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:46,979
the price comes down and starts to roll

3810
02:32:46,979 --> 02:32:47,580
um

3811
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:50,420
what do you see here

3812
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:54,560
right here

3813
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:11,760
and I am starving

3814
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,740
look at the reactions in here see that

3815
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:16,140
middle of this up candle

3816
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:18,000
to go all the look at the biased candle

3817
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,300
right there

3818
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,240
sweeps in just a little bit above it

3819
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:27,740
But ultimately starts to sell off

3820
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:29,640
it runs

3821
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:34,040
reaching for the order block right here

3822
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:40,760
and

3823
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,780
that's where we're at now

3824
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,760
what's this

3825
02:34:11,340 --> 02:34:13,260
Fair shoulder Block it's up candle

3826
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:16,760
though who sells in up candles

3827
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:24,660
smart money Banks Deep Pockets people

3828
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:28,460
with more money than icts for sure

3829
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:57,960
the body of the candle

3830
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:00,920
equilibrium

3831
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:06,840
from the low up to the midpoint is where

3832
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:08,939
you want to be seller

3833
02:35:08,939 --> 02:35:11,780
right in here

3834
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,140
right there you want to be a seller in

3835
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:25,080
anywhere in this in this area and only

3836
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:26,880
if it's in a time zone that we'd like to

3837
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:29,640
trade which is ICT Killzone for London

3838
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:33,140
and New York open or London close

3839
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:38,760
okay so

3840
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:41,359
um have I satisfied the inquiry about

3841
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:45,420
why I go back and forth with when I use

3842
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:48,920
the Wix and when I use the bodies

3843
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:55,319
okay if anything else

3844
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:58,260
if nothing else rather at least at least

3845
02:35:58,260 --> 02:36:00,479
today we we've answered that and wasted

3846
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:02,580
enough of your time doing it

3847
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:04,439
um

3848
02:36:04,439 --> 02:36:07,319
yeah that's uh

3849
02:36:07,319 --> 02:36:09,720
that was the point of the uh the last

3850
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:10,859
cable trade

3851
02:36:10,859 --> 02:36:11,520
um

3852
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:14,160
obviously we know that uh in the last

3853
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:16,680
couple times we talked live we were

3854
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:18,479
calling cable lower

3855
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:19,380
um

3856
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:22,680
using a higher time frame setup

3857
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:24,660
um holding on to the trade and taking

3858
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:27,120
profits before

3859
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,399
um because Average Joe's still in his

3860
02:36:29,399 --> 02:36:30,840
development State he's trying to learn

3861
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,479
and Trust the order blocks and such so

3862
02:36:33,479 --> 02:36:37,020
I'm kind of give you a a real timeline

3863
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:38,760
on what to expect what would be

3864
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:40,979
considered normal in my opinion and then

3865
02:36:40,979 --> 02:36:42,540
you'll start seeing in a couple months

3866
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:44,939
you'll see the stark contrast to doing

3867
02:36:44,939 --> 02:36:46,520
things a lot more

3868
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:49,260
systematic could you comment on dollar

3869
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:52,080
Bond decoupling uh yeah it's uh

3870
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:54,000
something I'm not following at this time

3871
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,620
uh because I do believe the interest

3872
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:58,439
rate markets are about to crash uh all

3873
02:36:58,439 --> 02:37:00,780
debt instruments should be uh not traded

3874
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,740
right now

3875
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:03,420
um they're gonna they're gonna put a

3876
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:05,220
whammy on everyone

3877
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:06,720
um and that's one of the reasons why I

3878
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:09,479
don't trade uh Bond Futures and I just

3879
02:37:09,479 --> 02:37:11,700
think that anyone in the instruments

3880
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,479
right now

3881
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:15,380
shouldn't be

3882
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:23,580
um a 4X LTD 4X LTD Larry Tom Dick if you

3883
02:37:23,580 --> 02:37:26,720
do a search on Google for mt4 platform

3884
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:32,420
Forex LTD they have the dollar Index

3885
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:38,960
yes Patrick it's being recorded

3886
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:49,620
uh uh the correlation s p and currencies

3887
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:51,479
um

3888
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:54,300
one that does really good with the s p

3889
02:37:54,300 --> 02:37:57,920
is uh Aussie dollar

3890
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,760
do I always use smt for confirmation or

3891
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:06,479
not

3892
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:07,280
um

3893
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:10,859
99 of my trades have some measure of an

3894
02:38:10,859 --> 02:38:12,180
smt

3895
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:15,260
attributed to it yes

3896
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:23,760
why do they manipulate the dollar when

3897
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:26,280
so free retail Traders you trade it uh

3898
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:27,540
well it's not that they're trading the

3899
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:29,100
dollar per se but they're trading

3900
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:31,200
against it uh when we're trading all the

3901
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:33,000
payers the majors like the the pound

3902
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,260
dollar

3903
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:36,060
um if you're if you trade cable you are

3904
02:38:36,060 --> 02:38:38,580
trading the dollar you're just trading

3905
02:38:38,580 --> 02:38:40,880
it short

3906
02:38:43,140 --> 02:38:45,240
so the dollar is a barometer in my

3907
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:47,399
opinion much like the stock indices are

3908
02:38:47,399 --> 02:38:51,060
like the Dow Jones NASDAQ and S P 500 if

3909
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:54,240
the overall trend of the General market

3910
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:56,340
and not the way I deem that is the

3911
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:58,680
health or uh

3912
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:00,420
strength or weakness of the overall

3913
02:39:00,420 --> 02:39:03,840
Market can be discerned by looking at

3914
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:06,260
one

3915
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:09,899
measure or device which being in my

3916
02:39:09,899 --> 02:39:12,899
opinion the dollar if it's

3917
02:39:12,899 --> 02:39:15,479
if it being the dollar is poised to move

3918
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:18,500
higher uh that's like one of the best

3919
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:21,000
scenarios for being a short seller for

3920
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,040
foreign currencies it's it's really

3921
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:24,180
simple

3922
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:27,479
um it's not like rocket science but uh

3923
02:39:27,479 --> 02:39:30,359
it's one of the things that's very

3924
02:39:30,359 --> 02:39:32,420
foreign

3925
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:35,000
often missed

3926
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,160
mistaken for uh its Effectiveness or

3927
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,640
importance

3928
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:14,760
um okay

3929
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:16,859
if you're looking for smt diverse if

3930
02:40:16,859 --> 02:40:18,420
you're looking for correlated payer s t

3931
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:20,640
diversions okay

3932
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:21,479
um

3933
02:40:21,479 --> 02:40:23,220
I didn't want to do this but it's really

3934
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:24,720
good that I do it because it's going to

3935
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:26,819
be a problem if I don't

3936
02:40:26,819 --> 02:40:27,660
um

3937
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:29,580
Euro pound

3938
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,620
I'm just curious did anybody else expect

3939
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:34,520
this to go higher

3940
02:40:37,859 --> 02:40:42,500
did we not call Euro pound higher

3941
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,840
we called this bad boy up okay so

3942
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:53,640
with

3943
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,859
when you look at this and this is what

3944
02:40:55,859 --> 02:40:57,540
makes foreign exchange difficult

3945
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:59,399
admittedly

3946
02:40:59,399 --> 02:41:02,880
but when you understand it it works in

3947
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:06,960
wonderful concert with three uh three

3948
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,819
currency pairs

3949
02:41:08,819 --> 02:41:10,859
um the dollar always has to be a factor

3950
02:41:10,859 --> 02:41:13,859
in your trading okay and

3951
02:41:13,859 --> 02:41:16,260
based on what the dollar is doing is

3952
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:19,380
going to be insightful what you do with

3953
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:21,840
your foreign currency trades okay

3954
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:22,500
um

3955
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,899
the dollar is

3956
02:41:24,899 --> 02:41:28,080
in essence in

3957
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:31,340
a consolidation

3958
02:41:31,979 --> 02:41:34,260
inside of a larger

3959
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:36,920
uptrend

3960
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,000
would everyone agree that that's the

3961
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,180
case

3962
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:48,120
okay so we're in a primary uptrend with

3963
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:49,740
a dollar in a consolidation so they're

3964
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:51,300
holding dollar

3965
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:53,220
so by holding dollar

3966
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:55,800
that gives the freedom for the other

3967
02:41:55,800 --> 02:41:59,100
foreign currencies to move rather strong

3968
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:01,380
Okay so

3969
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:04,740
there is two conditions that take place

3970
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:07,140
and you can have the dollar trending

3971
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:09,899
lower which would be a trending Market

3972
02:42:09,899 --> 02:42:12,120
higher in the foreign currency markets

3973
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:14,340
but if they hold Dollar in a

3974
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:16,380
consolidation you're going to see very

3975
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:19,560
strong and sharp moves in foreign

3976
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:21,300
currencies so there's a market maker 12

3977
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:22,500
tip for you

3978
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:26,460
if dollars in consolidation

3979
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:28,859
okay it's in a holding pattern

3980
02:42:28,859 --> 02:42:31,740
that means that the accelerated moves

3981
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:34,740
are going to occur not on the dollar

3982
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:37,380
side of the currencies in other words

3983
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:40,460
like uh

3984
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,180
how would I say this

3985
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:44,240
um

3986
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,700
the dot like the British pound and the

3987
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,380
dollar okay the British pound is going

3988
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:50,939
to have a lot more freedom to move

3989
02:42:50,939 --> 02:42:53,880
versus the dollar seeing uh respective

3990
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:56,520
mood like we see the cable

3991
02:42:56,520 --> 02:43:00,000
let's go over to the cable real quick

3992
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,200
okay cable is

3993
02:43:09,859 --> 02:43:13,080
moving right along lower continuing its

3994
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:15,240
primary downtrend

3995
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,340
and looking at it

3996
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:19,620
it's got a lot more freedom to move

3997
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:21,960
lower in a trending environment whereas

3998
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:23,760
the dollar is in a holding pattern and

3999
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:26,340
it's still stuck in its range

4000
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:28,620
respectively see that

4001
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:30,960
we're going sideways

4002
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:33,899
while the cable has freedom to go lower

4003
02:43:33,899 --> 02:43:37,500
in a trending move okay now

4004
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:40,439
for the euro

4005
02:43:40,439 --> 02:43:44,280
let's go over to a four hour chart

4006
02:43:44,280 --> 02:43:45,720
now I know I'm going to open up a

4007
02:43:45,720 --> 02:43:48,420
Pandora's box with all this because it's

4008
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:50,760
something I can't teach in one sitting

4009
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:55,020
but euro is in a holding pattern as well

4010
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:56,160
you see that we're in a very large

4011
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,100
consolidation in which we called this

4012
02:43:58,100 --> 02:44:01,500
well well months ago earlier on in the

4013
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:03,600
beginning of last year we said that when

4014
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:05,580
we get down to these levels it may go

4015
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:07,140
into a larger consolidation and trade

4016
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:08,819
sideways for for a long period of time

4017
02:44:08,819 --> 02:44:11,160
it's in video you can go see it it's

4018
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:12,479
there now you're probably saying what's

4019
02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:14,100
the big deal who cares it's you know

4020
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:16,380
it's you can't think of any net well yes

4021
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:17,939
you can because if you're in a large

4022
02:44:17,939 --> 02:44:19,859
consolidation in the euro

4023
02:44:19,859 --> 02:44:23,040
and you're in a consolidation in the

4024
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,300
dollar

4025
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,160
okay

4026
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:28,200
think about what you got here

4027
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:30,060
if you have a piece of paper and a pen

4028
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:31,859
and if you don't have one shame on you

4029
02:44:31,859 --> 02:44:33,120
because you're watching a video with me

4030
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,060
live you should always be taking notes

4031
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:37,680
I want you to take

4032
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,720
um on your piece of paper in like a

4033
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:41,760
triangle formation okay I want you to

4034
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:44,580
write uh the dollar

4035
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:46,500
at the center of your piece of paper

4036
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:49,080
lower left I want you to write Euro

4037
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:50,700
in the lower right I want you to write

4038
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:53,060
British pound

4039
02:44:53,060 --> 02:44:55,979
okay so you have the top of the triangle

4040
02:44:55,979 --> 02:44:58,800
is a dollar the lower left is Euro lower

4041
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:02,340
right is the British pound

4042
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,020
right now

4043
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,060
Dollar on a four hour basis is

4044
02:45:06,060 --> 02:45:08,100
consolidating

4045
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:09,420
it's in an uptrend but it's

4046
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:11,640
consolidating you can see that so you

4047
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:14,720
have to circle the dollar

4048
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:19,760
the euro

4049
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:21,060
is in

4050
02:45:21,060 --> 02:45:24,439
the consolidation as well

4051
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:28,740
in a primary downtrend

4052
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:32,600
so you need to circle the euro

4053
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:36,200
now watch

4054
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:39,080
British pound

4055
02:45:39,899 --> 02:45:41,340
ing lower

4056
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:44,340
it's in a trending environment

4057
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:45,540
okay

4058
02:45:45,540 --> 02:45:47,760
now I don't know if you ever studied

4059
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:50,580
fractions or or whatever in school but

4060
02:45:50,580 --> 02:45:52,800
if you didn't study fractions this is

4061
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:54,060
probably going to be a little tricky for

4062
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:55,920
you but it's really simplistic when you

4063
02:45:55,920 --> 02:46:00,020
understand fractions the

4064
02:46:00,420 --> 02:46:03,300
the dollar in the Euro are in

4065
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:04,560
consolidation they're in holding

4066
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:06,359
patterns okay

4067
02:46:06,359 --> 02:46:08,580
the cable is being permitted to move

4068
02:46:08,580 --> 02:46:11,399
lower okay

4069
02:46:11,399 --> 02:46:15,180
the British pound is dropping while the

4070
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:18,000
euro is sideways to up

4071
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,180
now in those environments people like

4072
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:23,819
Steve Morrow which learned my stuff

4073
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:25,800
partially and ran with it and tried to

4074
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:28,319
make money doing it I never explained

4075
02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:29,939
all the things that you're learning in

4076
02:46:29,939 --> 02:46:31,979
Market maker 12 or a market maker series

4077
02:46:31,979 --> 02:46:34,200
really until I just recently started

4078
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:35,580
doing it so that's the reason why when

4079
02:46:35,580 --> 02:46:38,460
you watch his horseshit on YouTube he'll

4080
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:40,859
say that correlation doesn't work

4081
02:46:40,859 --> 02:46:43,740
correlation works perfectly but you have

4082
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:45,600
to understand why the banks are doing

4083
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,520
what they're doing and holding certain

4084
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,560
currencies in consolidation to allow

4085
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:51,300
other currencies to run

4086
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:54,600
and it's done by manipulating the whole

4087
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:55,380
board

4088
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:56,640
or

4089
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:58,920
working the crosses

4090
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:01,439
and what I mean by that is we have those

4091
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:04,140
three currency pairs there okay I'm not

4092
02:47:04,140 --> 02:47:05,399
currency pairs or currencies you have

4093
02:47:05,399 --> 02:47:07,740
the dollar which is the king it's above

4094
02:47:07,740 --> 02:47:09,120
everyone else

4095
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,340
you're on the lower left both Euro and

4096
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:15,140
dollar are in consolidation

4097
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:18,300
cable or British pound is allowed to

4098
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:20,580
move it's been trending lower it did not

4099
02:47:20,580 --> 02:47:22,500
enter into a consolidation it's trending

4100
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,359
lower

4101
02:47:24,359 --> 02:47:26,520
because the cable

4102
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:28,260
or British pound is in a trending

4103
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:30,180
environment lower dollars in

4104
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:33,060
consolidation and fiber is in

4105
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:34,740
consolidation

4106
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:37,020
that means the trade is going to be in

4107
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:39,500
what pair

4108
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:45,180
draw a line connecting Euro and pound

4109
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:47,280
on your chart that you just drew or a

4110
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:52,460
picture connect Euro in British pound

4111
02:47:54,899 --> 02:47:57,960
if cable or British pound is dropping in

4112
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,640
a trending environment and Euros being

4113
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:02,460
held what reaction and price action what

4114
02:48:02,460 --> 02:48:04,740
direction would that indicate

4115
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:06,780
or ex what you would expect to see in

4116
02:48:06,780 --> 02:48:09,060
Euro pound what direction should it go

4117
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:12,260
up or down

4118
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:13,740
now

4119
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:15,300
you want to make millions of dollars

4120
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:17,280
these are the types of setups that you

4121
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:19,200
look for because they happen a couple

4122
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:20,460
times a year

4123
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:22,460
they are

4124
02:48:22,460 --> 02:48:25,560
unbelievable loaded deals I mean it's

4125
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:29,520
like they are so telling that they you

4126
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:30,840
can't miss it but you have to understand

4127
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:33,479
the Dynamics behind it otherwise it'll

4128
02:48:33,479 --> 02:48:35,460
completely be oblivious to you

4129
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:36,720
now

4130
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,640
for those if you're just watching this

4131
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:39,660
for the first time it's going to sound

4132
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:41,460
like well I mean of course now the Euro

4133
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:43,680
pound's been rocketing up I mean it's

4134
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,660
been going up for hundreds it's hundreds

4135
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,340
of Pips Michael of course now you're

4136
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:48,780
going to come out and say this stuff

4137
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:50,040
works like that

4138
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:52,439
well if you were with me the beginning

4139
02:48:52,439 --> 02:48:54,540
of December

4140
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:55,920
um I was telling everybody this thing

4141
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:57,540
was going to roll and Roll and Roll okay

4142
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:58,620
and

4143
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:01,859
where we're at is Euro pound I know I

4144
02:49:01,859 --> 02:49:02,939
got this here

4145
02:49:02,939 --> 02:49:04,979
's Euro pound

4146
02:49:04,979 --> 02:49:06,420
and

4147
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:08,819
let's go over here

4148
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:10,680
excuse me

4149
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:12,240
we have

4150
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,680
the market

4151
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:17,359
trading down into what

4152
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,020
what's this right here

4153
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:27,359
pull a shoulder block who buys in Down

4154
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:29,840
Candles

4155
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:36,740
Banks

4156
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:40,020
okay

4157
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:42,000
we have a small little range what makes

4158
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,620
it a small range look around it there's

4159
02:49:43,620 --> 02:49:45,060
bigger ranges and there's a smaller

4160
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:46,260
range there's a smaller range in

4161
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:48,359
contrast to the bigger ranges okay all I

4162
02:49:48,359 --> 02:49:50,399
did was use something I learned from

4163
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:53,760
Larry Williams my mentor small ranges we

4164
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:55,979
got large ranges and large ranges we got

4165
02:49:55,979 --> 02:49:58,620
small ranges okay so this is a smaller

4166
02:49:58,620 --> 02:50:00,120
range I'm going to use the wick to the

4167
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:01,319
body

4168
02:50:01,319 --> 02:50:02,700
and

4169
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:05,399
we're cutting through candles guys so

4170
02:50:05,399 --> 02:50:07,020
throw all the supply and demand

4171
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:08,460
horseshit out the window you got to go

4172
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:10,140
through the candles and find out where

4173
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:13,260
the primary Pro uh the the parent price

4174
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:15,420
swing starts here

4175
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,160
okay they come down and dip into the

4176
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,260
door block here but what time frame is

4177
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,580
this

4178
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:22,200
daily

4179
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:25,080
can eat into that order block especially

4180
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:28,020
if it's going to be a sizable move

4181
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:30,359
right here you go

4182
02:50:30,359 --> 02:50:33,000
boom takes off now think

4183
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,140
what do you see here

4184
02:51:01,819 --> 02:51:04,439
they're all flashing it's a market maker

4185
02:51:04,439 --> 02:51:06,600
buy profile

4186
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:09,140
foreign

4187
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:30,479
a buyer okay the mechanics are dollars

4188
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:33,120
in consolidation Euros in consolidation

4189
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:34,979
we said you're was most likely going to

4190
02:51:34,979 --> 02:51:36,300
go into consolidation before it went

4191
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:38,280
into consolidation how did I know that

4192
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,800
why did I say those words because I

4193
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:42,720
study Market profiling and I'm not

4194
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:43,979
talking about Market profile where they

4195
02:51:43,979 --> 02:51:46,080
have all those bars vertically along the

4196
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:49,319
horizontal I'm sorry horizontal lines I

4197
02:51:49,319 --> 02:51:51,060
guess shown volume or whatever around

4198
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:52,500
specific price levels which I don't have

4199
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,420
any faith in okay when I say Market

4200
02:51:54,420 --> 02:51:56,100
profile I'm talking about is it in a

4201
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:58,319
market trend is it a consolidation or is

4202
02:51:58,319 --> 02:51:59,700
it reversing there's a three market

4203
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:01,200
profiles

4204
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:03,800
okay

4205
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:05,939
JP

4206
02:52:05,939 --> 02:52:07,620
um I think you're probably the only one

4207
02:52:07,620 --> 02:52:08,880
that can't hear me

4208
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,020
so if you're hearing this in the

4209
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:11,460
recording I understand that everyone

4210
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:12,960
else is able to hear me so it's

4211
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,279
something that's

4212
02:52:14,279 --> 02:52:16,859
limited to you

4213
02:52:16,859 --> 02:52:21,840
but we have the Euro pound free to Rally

4214
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:25,200
okay and if it's going to Rally how far

4215
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:26,819
is it going to Rally what's the

4216
02:52:26,819 --> 02:52:28,560
structure behind all the rallying it

4217
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:30,120
should take place well we have a

4218
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:32,399
consolidation Market drops down into an

4219
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:35,279
areas of buying smart money reversal low

4220
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:37,080
risk buy inside of a bullish order block

4221
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:39,859
rallies off

4222
02:52:39,859 --> 02:52:42,540
reaccumulation takes off the top of the

4223
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:45,080
consolidation

4224
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:51,779
if

4225
02:52:51,779 --> 02:52:55,680
you see trades like

4226
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:57,359
um

4227
02:52:57,359 --> 02:52:59,880
well you can do the same process with

4228
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:04,260
the kiwi and Aussie okay you just look

4229
02:53:04,260 --> 02:53:06,420
at the price action between the dollar

4230
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:08,819
the kiwi and the Australian dollar

4231
02:53:08,819 --> 02:53:11,160
okay the same thing you can do with the

4232
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:12,420
Japanese Yen

4233
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:14,760
Euro and the cable

4234
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:17,819
just replace the dollar with the yen

4235
02:53:17,819 --> 02:53:19,920
and you look at the difference between

4236
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:22,380
our are you seeing the yen in

4237
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:25,080
consolidation or is it trending

4238
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:28,020
or is the Euro consolidating or is it

4239
02:53:28,020 --> 02:53:30,120
trending or is the pound

4240
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:33,000
your consolidating or trending okay and

4241
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,100
by having those three on there by seeing

4242
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:36,899
which ones are being held the other

4243
02:53:36,899 --> 02:53:38,340
one's going to be freed up they're only

4244
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:40,020
going to hold two

4245
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:42,000
okay they're only going to hold two in

4246
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,040
this Triad now when you're looking at

4247
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:45,359
two pairs

4248
02:53:45,359 --> 02:53:47,220
okay because you can have correlated

4249
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:49,500
setups like this as well where they'll

4250
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:51,960
hold Euro sideways okay and they'll run

4251
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:55,920
cable and they'll run dollar

4252
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:57,540
so there's a there's a little bit of a

4253
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:59,779
thing that uh has to come by experience

4254
02:53:59,779 --> 02:54:02,340
and that unfortunately is going to have

4255
02:54:02,340 --> 02:54:04,920
to be worked out for by you okay and

4256
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:07,319
it's a knack type thing it's an

4257
02:54:07,319 --> 02:54:08,760
experienced thing I wish I could say

4258
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,500
this is you know what you do every

4259
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:13,380
single time but it's just an experienced

4260
02:54:13,380 --> 02:54:14,700
thing that you have to build in your own

4261
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:16,560
trading okay but these are the building

4262
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:18,240
blocks how you get to it because like I

4263
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:20,460
said I can't see where the orders are on

4264
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:24,300
the banks I can't see them really okay I

4265
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:25,979
just know how they're most likely going

4266
02:54:25,979 --> 02:54:28,140
to be layered into the marketplace and

4267
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:29,399
where they're most likely going to reach

4268
02:54:29,399 --> 02:54:32,340
for based on that and if I start seeing

4269
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:34,680
signs that a particular currency is

4270
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:37,260
being held in consolidation they're only

4271
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:38,460
going to hold a currency in

4272
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:42,180
consolidation to allow the cross to move

4273
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:43,920
and the easiest way to describe it is

4274
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,240
what we just did here with the Euro

4275
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:49,939
pound okay and how you use that sets up

4276
02:54:49,939 --> 02:54:52,380
astronomical trading opportunities where

4277
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:54,420
if you see it happening and it's only a

4278
02:54:54,420 --> 02:54:56,100
couple times a year it does it you know

4279
02:54:56,100 --> 02:54:57,779
it's not every single pair it does it

4280
02:54:57,779 --> 02:54:59,100
but there's a couple times where they

4281
02:54:59,100 --> 02:55:01,620
set up like these Mega trades and when

4282
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:05,040
you see it it's just like man it's so

4283
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:07,200
telling what they're doing so I'm not

4284
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:08,939
sure where you are in your scope of

4285
02:55:08,939 --> 02:55:11,399
trading but if you could get into an

4286
02:55:11,399 --> 02:55:13,680
area of uh you know taking a trade

4287
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:15,540
around the 70 level

4288
02:55:15,540 --> 02:55:17,760
down here knowing that the likelihood is

4289
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:19,680
going to run up to here and clear out

4290
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:21,899
that not so not even so much as this see

4291
02:55:21,899 --> 02:55:24,120
it just gets back to here okay if you

4292
02:55:24,120 --> 02:55:26,340
can find trades like that every year

4293
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:29,399
just one of them and you use your uh

4294
02:55:29,399 --> 02:55:31,200
your money

4295
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:33,359
management and your trade setups if you

4296
02:55:33,359 --> 02:55:36,840
can you set up a trade down here with

4297
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:39,540
20 30 Pips risk to well let's see what

4298
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:41,819
it is I'm not sure what it is really top

4299
02:55:41,819 --> 02:55:44,779
my head um

4300
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:48,060
it's over 500 Pips and ultimately it's

4301
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:52,760
gone now to set over 700 Pips

4302
02:55:55,620 --> 02:55:57,960
um they usually last several weeks to a

4303
02:55:57,960 --> 02:55:59,580
couple months because they're macro type

4304
02:55:59,580 --> 02:56:03,120
events that's being set up when you're

4305
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:05,640
looking at a daily chart now these same

4306
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:07,380
phenomenon take place on Lower time

4307
02:56:07,380 --> 02:56:09,300
frames too like you can see dollar being

4308
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:11,220
held in a small consolidation on an

4309
02:56:11,220 --> 02:56:14,279
hourly basis where euro is ripping and

4310
02:56:14,279 --> 02:56:17,100
cables being held well that's going to

4311
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:18,420
indicate the same thing we're kind of

4312
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:21,660
seeing here it's wherever pair whatever

4313
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:23,700
currency is being allowed to move

4314
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,979
if the other one's dropping you got to

4315
02:56:25,979 --> 02:56:27,420
look at how that relates to like the

4316
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:30,420
Euro pound euro is being held won't drop

4317
02:56:30,420 --> 02:56:32,880
with cable okay and it's going the other

4318
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:34,859
direction or staying in consolidation

4319
02:56:34,859 --> 02:56:37,200
and if the cable is really tearing lower

4320
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:39,060
like we've been seeing that's going to

4321
02:56:39,060 --> 02:56:41,819
be 100 bullish for Euro pound because

4322
02:56:41,819 --> 02:56:44,640
Euro won't be going down with cable it's

4323
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:46,500
going to be holding up and because pound

4324
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:48,180
is the second in the currency pair of

4325
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:52,080
Euro pound it's going to allow Euro to

4326
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:53,880
um or Euro pound to show appreciation

4327
02:56:53,880 --> 02:56:56,279
going higher and not see it Go lower and

4328
02:56:56,279 --> 02:56:58,200
it'll be dynamic it won't be this little

4329
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:00,660
muddled little slow increase over time

4330
02:57:00,660 --> 02:57:02,460
it's going to be like boom boom boom

4331
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:04,380
real hard like you see here it's

4332
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:05,640
indicative that you see it right here

4333
02:57:05,640 --> 02:57:07,500
that's how you find explosive price

4334
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:10,380
moves it's not seeing

4335
02:57:10,380 --> 02:57:12,960
um them both moving in tandem you won't

4336
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:15,660
see these explosive moves that you're

4337
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,880
seeing here when Euro and cable are

4338
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:20,580
moving in tandem it can't happen it can

4339
02:57:20,580 --> 02:57:22,560
only happen when one's being held and

4340
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:24,180
they're holding it to create these

4341
02:57:24,180 --> 02:57:25,800
environments like this

4342
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:28,640
does that make sense

4343
02:57:46,439 --> 02:57:49,560
okay there's a lot of questions you guys

4344
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:52,439
are asking and I really wish I had the

4345
02:57:52,439 --> 02:57:54,300
time to get all over them but the

4346
02:57:54,300 --> 02:57:56,640
wonderful thing about this uh this

4347
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:58,979
platform is it logs everything that's

4348
02:57:58,979 --> 02:58:01,620
said to me in question format so that

4349
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:03,600
way if I don't get to your question or

4350
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:05,460
comment while we're doing the recording

4351
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:07,439
or presentation it gives me an

4352
02:58:07,439 --> 02:58:08,640
opportunity to go through it and I can

4353
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,439
sometimes answer it in a future video or

4354
02:58:10,439 --> 02:58:12,899
sometimes as easy as a tweet so if I

4355
02:58:12,899 --> 02:58:15,479
didn't get to your stuff

4356
02:58:15,479 --> 02:58:16,979
um or or question or whatever I

4357
02:58:16,979 --> 02:58:19,200
apologize but it really is a ton of them

4358
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,340
I mean there's so many of them coming

4359
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:24,840
they're still flipping by so yeah so the

4360
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:27,840
uh the recording is

4361
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:30,479
um obviously recording still with the I

4362
02:58:30,479 --> 02:58:32,220
will have to uh

4363
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:34,740
cut it here I want to be able to make

4364
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:36,600
sure I get this uh

4365
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,700
this recording out to you before I go

4366
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:40,920
out with my wife tonight so

4367
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,880
um

4368
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:43,740
give me some time to get it formatted

4369
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:46,020
it's really quick usually when a format

4370
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:49,140
to MP4 with uh this Pro with this

4371
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:51,660
platform and then obviously uploading it

4372
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:53,640
to my uh my server doesn't take long at

4373
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:55,140
all so

4374
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:56,160
um

4375
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:59,279
I'm going to close it here

4376
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:02,640
I'm starving and I'm not sure how long

4377
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,740
we've been going at this but uh it's

4378
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:06,960
been a couple hours I think but the uh

4379
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:08,880
three hours thanks Mike it didn't feel

4380
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:10,020
like three hours though I was thinking

4381
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:11,939
like two hours but it's three hours good

4382
02:59:11,939 --> 02:59:13,260
grief

4383
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:14,580
well

4384
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:16,439
um I'm gonna let's say I'll close it

4385
02:59:16,439 --> 02:59:17,399
here

4386
02:59:17,399 --> 02:59:19,260
this is not one of those videos you

4387
02:59:19,260 --> 02:59:22,020
watch one time okay this is one of those

4388
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:24,120
videos where you can listen to while

4389
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:25,920
you're driving back and forth to work a

4390
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:28,439
couple times a week okay uh listen to me

4391
02:59:28,439 --> 02:59:29,700
because a lot of it's a lot of jaw

4392
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:31,500
boning okay

4393
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:33,540
um only really watch it when it gets to

4394
02:59:33,540 --> 02:59:35,100
the charting stuff where we're actually

4395
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:36,960
talking about examples but the first

4396
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:38,640
part of the video is really good uh

4397
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:42,180
commute discussion if I offended you

4398
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:44,939
with uh my language please just that's

4399
02:59:44,939 --> 02:59:47,279
not my intent to do that but sometimes I

4400
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:49,020
just get a little passionate about some

4401
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:51,600
of the things I say and the human enemy

4402
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:53,819
comes out so with that guys I wish you

4403
02:59:53,819 --> 02:59:55,680
good luck and good trading and give me

4404
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,240
