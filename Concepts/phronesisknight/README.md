**Mitigate a level of Demand\Supply** => Continuation of a Trend
**Violate a Protected High\Low** => Directional Change = Start a new trend

**Structural Structure**
**Structural Range**

- Working with LTF retracement inside of HTF Structural Range

[2022.10.03] [26] [Rules-Of-Engagement] 

LIQ = Liquidity = Money = Orders = Fuel
Different Form Of LIQ: 
    Structural LIQ:         (presented through structure like: old-highs\old-lows | higher-high\higher-low | FVG)
        - internal LIQ
        - external LIQ
        - BSL
        - SSL
        - IRLIQ = internal-range LIQ
        - ERLIQ = external-range LIQ
    
    Session LIQ:            (like: session-high\session-low )
        - Asia (18-01)
        - London 02-06
        - NewYork 07-10

1. You Must Trade LIQ
2. You Must Understand Logic
3. LIQ without Logic is useless
4. SMC is useless without Logic
5. SM is the ability to think like Market-Makers (that moves the price = ALGO)

Engineering-Liquidity to Induce You before it come back to liquidate-You [https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbddN_N2Zy/]

**LIQG = Liquidity Grab = Smart Money Footprint = SMF
1. SM had reasons to come back to the area where huge buy\sell happened 
2. At least to mitigate the last point where huge buy\sell started [buy-to-sell]

**Flip Zone**:
1. base on pervious movement
2. after SSL is taken in consolidation area
3. expecting a bullish OTE for HTF = expecting market-structure-shift in LTF
2. but bullish OTE failed and huge sell happened 
3. supply is winner in the battle between supply and demand
4. this bullish OTE area which fight happened is the Flip Zone

**Supply and Demand Areas**
1. They are not Areas of Sells or Buys 
1. They are Areas of Negotiation of Big-Boys

Total movement of price is to: 
1. (grab iLIQ and delivers to eLIQ) <=> (grab eLIQ and deliver to iLIQ) 
2. (grab BSL and delivers to SSL) <=> (grab SSL and deliver to BSL)
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.29] [01] [intro-to-SMC] 
**Concept: Supply\Demand**

1. Supply Zone == Big Sellers waiting to SELL = Level of Big Sellers
2. Demand Zone == Big Buyers waiting to BUY   = Level of Big Buyers

Big Buyers/Sellers = institutions / banks

**Concept: Inducement**
Purpose of Inducement => Creating Liquidity 
Purpose of Inducement => Engagement
Purpose of Inducement => Giving reasons to retail traders to enter the market
Idea behind Inducement => Convince You to take a setup
Idea behind Inducement => Convince Traders to engage price by creating chart patterns that fits Bus \ Sell Setup in terms of TA

Retail Chart Patterns:  
- Double Top
- Double Bottom
- Triple Top
- Triple Bottom
- Head and Shoulder
- Trendline
- Price Action Patterns

Where we have Big Buyers \ Sellers ?
Big Buyers \ Sellers => Counter Trend Traders
\\The ALGO have been programmed to follow the behavior of Big Guys.
if every body in the world is seeing a setup then the setup is an Inducement.

\\Inducement => invites you enter the market
\\Liquidity => takes you out of the market

\\Liquidity Fuels the momentum of price in certain zones

Multiple Inducement:
1. Send Buyers\Sellers out of the market
2. Create Fuel for Big Guys who are sitting in Supply\Demand zones


- Initial Intention is to Buy
- Second Intention is to induce sellers to enter the market for more liquidity
- purpose of inducement <<market needs liquidity>>
- inducement invites you to engage the market
- liquidity takes you out of the market

**Once a Supply level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Demand**
**Once a Demand level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Supply**
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.29] [02] [intro-to-SMC] 
Consolidating = Range = No Clear trend = Moving from a supply to demand and vice versa.

**Concept: Inefficiency**
Inefficiency: distance between candle 1 and candle 3 are inefficient move
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Price must move to inside Inefficiency and fill it before continuing its trend.
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Inefficiency must be filled.
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Imbalances must be filled.

1. Price must delivered efficiently
2. Price forms inducements
3. Price takes-out inducements

Trendline liquidity => every time you see a trendline it is violated
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.30] [03] [Market-Structure] 

**Concept: Market-Structure**

- ClearTrend    => [Starts-after-inducement-and-taking-liquidity]

- UpTrend       => [StrongLow---WeakHigh]
- DownTrend     => [StrongHigh---WeakLow]

- StrongHigh    => [ProtectedHigh] [Should-not-violated-to-the-upside]
- StrongLow     => [ProtectedLow] [Should-not-violated-to-the-downside]

\\HTF Rounds creates LTF Trends
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.30] [03] [Market-Structure] 

**Concept: Multi-Timeframe-Structural-Corelation**
H4 CHoCH is m15 BoS
m15 CHoCH is m1 BoS

Supply violated => transfer power to Demand
Demand violated => transfer power to Supply
------------------------------------------------

Structure inside another Structure
Sell to Buy => Retracement Leg

[16:12] [directional-change]
1. mitigate a level of demand
2. violate a protected high
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[06] [Market-Structure] [external-liquidity] [major-liquidity]
HTF Round is LTF trend

in uptrend   :: HH=> weakHigh , HL=> strongLow
in downtrend :: LL=> weakLow , LH=> strongHigh

in uptrend   :: HH=> ext-LIQ , HL=> maj-LIQ
in downtrend :: LL=> ext-LIQ , LH=> maj-LIQ

HTF LIQ:
    maj-LIQ == respected LIQ == expected to be respected
    ext-LIQ == violated LIQ == expected to be violated (takes out LIQ)
LTF LIQ
    int-LIQ == internal LIQ (FVG)
    ind-LIQ == inducement LIQ

**3 Type of market structure**:
1. Simple Structure    
2. Complex Structure   
3. Range Structure

1. Simple-Structure: 
    printing clear (HH,HL) (LL,LH)

2. Complex-Structure: 
    - combination of (Shallow Corrective Wave) + (Deep Correcting Wave)
    - shallow corrective wave = mitigate internal-Structure = pullback internal-Structure = fail to continue its HTF trend
    - deep correcting wave  = mitigate maj-LIQ

3. Range-Structure
    - price breaks out-of-the-range and the create a new structure 
    - it is called Range Structure because it is out of the range
    - most time when you see Range-Structure we are not expecting a deep pullback

internal-Structure = int-Structure = HTF Structure (for example: h4)
external-Structure = ext-Structure = LTF Structure (for example: m5)
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[07] [ext-LIQ] [int-LIQ]

**different types of ext-LIQ** BSL\SSL
- [less-concern-LIQ] Old Highs\Lows
- [common-LIQ] Equal Highs\Lows (EQH\EQL) [double-top] [double-bottom] [triple-top] [triple-bottom] 
- [common-LIQ] Trendline phantom [Buy-side-Trendline-phantom] [sell-side-Trendline-phantom] 

[stop-hunt]
phantom EQH: [buy-stop]   1. price grab BSL\EQH 2. price continues its direction to the downside
phantom EQL: [sell-stop]  1. price grab SSL\EQL 2. price continues its direction to the upside

**different types of int-LIQ**
- FVG = imbalance = inefficiency
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[08] [live-examples]
**Confluence** (after concepts we talk about confluence)
- putting all of the concepts together 
- create a story for price 
- able to analyze the market 
- take proper financial decision

- takes LIQ from the SS then deliver it to the BS 
- takes LIQ from the BS then deliver it to the SS 
- price continues to a POI
- price put to a momentum
- aggressively moves to the up\down side depending on the Order Flow

**price must not take a certain level of liquidity if it doesn't needs to**
- suppose order flow is bearish
- if we have LIQ to the upside
- most times we don't have supply zone to be mitigated above the LIQ
- then price continues in the bearish order flow

- price always mitigate int-LIQ before heading to the ext-LIQ or price will go to the area or less-concern-LIQ
- common-LIQ        : every one can see that LIQ
- less-concern-LIQ  : not every one can see that LIQ like Old high\low
------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------
[09] [int-LIQ]
imbalance = IMB = the difference bw high of candle 1 and low of candle 3 = strong momentum cause IMB

What price dose?
- seek LIQ
- tap into LIQ
- get momentum from LIQ
- move 

**Inefficiency as Entry Point \ Inefficiency as Target**

**Price must not fill every Inefficiency, it solely depends on order flow**
------------------------------------------------
