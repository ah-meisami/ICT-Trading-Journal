[2022.06.14] [05] [Market-Structure]

**Mitigate a level of Demand\Supply** => Continuation of a Trend
**Violate a Protected High\Low** => Directional Change = Start a new trend

**Structural Structure**
**Structural Range**

- Working with LTF retracement inside of HTF Structural Range

[2022.10.03] [26] [Rules-Of-Engagement] 

LIQ = Liquidity = Money = Orders = Fuel
Different Form Of LIQ: 
    Structural LIQ:         (presented through structure like: old-highs\old-lows | higher-high\higher-low | FVG)
        - internal LIQ
        - external LIQ
        - BSL
        - SSL
        - IRLIQ = internal-range LIQ
        - ERLIQ = external-range LIQ
    
    Session LIQ:            (like: session-high\session-low )
        - Asia (18-01)
        - London 02-06
        - NewYork 07-10

1. You Must Trade LIQ
2. You Must Understand Logic
3. LIQ without Logic is useless
4. SMC is useless without Logic
5. SM is the ability to think like Market-Makers (that moves the price = ALGO)

Engineering-Liquidity to Induce You before it come back to liquidate-You [https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbddN_N2Zy/]

**LIQG = Liquidity Grab = Smart Money Footprint = SMF
1. SM had reasons to come back to the area where huge buy\sell happened 
2. At least to mitigate the last point where huge buy\sell started [buy-to-sell]

**Flip Zone**:
1. base on pervious movement
2. after SSL is taken in consolidation area
3. expecting a bullish OTE for HTF = expecting market-structure-shift in LTF
2. but bullish OTE failed and huge sell happened 
3. supply is winner in the battle between supply and demand
4. this bullish OTE area which fight happened is the Flip Zone

**Supply and Demand Areas**
1. They are not Areas of Sells or Buys 
1. They are Areas of Negotiation of Big-Boys

Total movement of price is to: 
1. (grab iLIQ and delivers to eLIQ) <=> (grab eLIQ and deliver to iLIQ) 
2. (grab BSL and delivers to SSL) <=> (grab SSL and deliver to BSL)

[2022.12.29] [01] [intro-to-SMC] 
**Concept: Supply\Demand**

1. Supply Zone == Big Sellers waiting to SELL = Level of Big Sellers
2. Demand Zone == Big Buyers waiting to BUY   = Level of Big Buyers

Big Buyers/Sellers = institutions / banks

**Concept: Inducement**
Purpose of Inducement => Creating Liquidity 
Purpose of Inducement => Engagement
Purpose of Inducement => Giving reasons to retail traders to enter the market
Idea behind Inducement => Convince You to take a setup
Idea behind Inducement => Convince Traders to engage price by creating chart patterns that fits Bus \ Sell Setup in terms of TA

Retail Chart Patterns:  
- Double Top
- Double Bottom
- Triple Top
- Triple Bottom
- Head and Shoulder
- Trendline
- Price Action Patterns

Where we have Big Buyers \ Sellers ?
Big Buyers \ Sellers => Counter Trend Traders
\\The ALGO have been programmed to follow the behavior of Big Guys.
if every body in the world is seeing a setup then the setup is an Inducement.

\\Inducement => invites you enter the market
\\Liquidity => takes you out of the market

\\Liquidity Fuels the momentum of price in certain zones

Multiple Inducement:
1. Send Buyers\Sellers out of the market
2. Create Fuel for Big Guys who are sitting in Supply\Demand zones


- Initial Intention is to Buy
- Second Intention is to induce sellers to enter the market for more liquidity
- purpose of inducement <<market needs liquidity>>
- inducement invites you to engage the market
- liquidity takes you out of the market

**Once a Supply level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Demand**
**Once a Demand level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Supply**
