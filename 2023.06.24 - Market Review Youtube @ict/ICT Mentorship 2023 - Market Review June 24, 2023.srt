1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,140
good afternoon folks

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,420
happy Saturday to you

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,859
so we're gonna do a little bit of a

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,420
review today

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,460
keep you too long

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,439
so here's the dollar Index is our weekly

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,619
chart

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,440
there is a fair value Gap in here

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,980
that has been left in place from

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,620
last week's trading which is this weekly

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,040
candle

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,520
I want to see if we can

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,899
keep this level

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,000
into in the form of

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
resistance in other words it can go up

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,920
here hit it and how we trade after we go

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,399
into it

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,539
it's going to be vital for me going

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,640
forward now if we were to go above it

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,400
come back down in I would expect it to

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,420
act as

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,820
support and maybe reach up into the

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,380
rejection block which is this highest up

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,159
close

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,740
price here and then eventually

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,240
the high and the consequent

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,200
encouragement of that Wick

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,759
I want to wait and see what

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,100
we get on Sunday's opening and I'm going

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,920
to allow Monday's Trading

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,299
because there's a lot of things

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,979
happening

33
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,900
around the world and if you're not

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,040
paying

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,320
attention

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,860
and these things might surprise you

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,020
so just check the news headlines and

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,600
you'll see what I'm talking about but

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
moving on into a daily chart

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,400
so there is our weekly Fairbank app

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,079
viewed

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,840
with a daily Candlestick chart so it

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,979
doesn't look like there's any imbalance

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,000
there at all

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,799
but on the weekly chart

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,780
there is

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,200
okay so we did have some support off of

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,479
this fair value Gap here

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,219
I mentioned when we were dropping go

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,899
back and look at the other commentaries

51
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,179
that would reach into here at a volume

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,560
and balance instead of a couple of that

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
then this is the area to watch

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
we traded down into that on Thursday

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
rallied up into

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
consequent encouragement of this Wick

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,900
right there

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,080
so it's a wait and see so somebody's

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,080
trading Monday's trading we keep my

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,239
cards close to my vest I'm not certain

61
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,180
what we'll see but it could be pretty

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,020
volatile next week

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,319
you're a dollar daily chart

64
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,660
okay we have a weekly imbalance

65
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,800
here

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,180
and you can look at that on your own

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,920
charts and try not to put too many

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,480
things in front of you to look at but

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,980
also leave you somewhere to go in and do

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,379
your own investigation

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,599
so we have a weekly fair value Gap year

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,879
again look at your weekly chart and

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,760
you'll see this same thing here easiest

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,540
way to identify it with study is put a

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,400
rectangle on

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,340
the daily chart from this low

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,140
to this candle's High

78
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,120
and then go to your weekly chart and

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,739
you'll see right away what that Weekly

80
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,019
fair value Gap is so the fair value Gap

81
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,220
is formed now because of this

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,400
leak close

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,620
we've worked off of this everybody Gap

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,800
and I want to see

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,040
does this find out find its way above

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
the weekly fair value Gap in active

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,879
support

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,220
there's been some

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,340
issues with the crops

90
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,560
from agricultural standpoint for folks

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,360
that follow the commodity Market

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
the grain markets because there's a

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,140
drought right now corn wheat and

94
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,180
soybeans

95
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,180
are expected to have a difficult year so

96
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,620
that would be

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,099
bullish for those grain prices

98
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,620
and if that's the case that would

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,140
probably be seen with a dollar index

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,599
that is consolidating

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,780
or lower

102
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,900
but we have the added

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,120
uncertainty of

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,820
War you paying attention

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
so

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,020
there's a lot of things to to weigh out

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,419
so what do you do with this information

108
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,120
when I see it like this I stay to

109
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,100
the day trading side of Market not doing

110
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
longer term analysis sticking to

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,580
intraday

112
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,320
trading the sessions only morning

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,780
session afternoon Session One in session

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,500
that type of thing

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,259
hourly chart here you can see

116
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,139
we ran above by side

117
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,600
shift in Market structure here

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
right there and then we rally back up

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,740
this is model 2022.

120
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,560
here's your entry and then drawing down

121
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,199
into and then balance

122
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,620
that would be your perfect 2022 model

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,600
Market trades all the ACT down into this

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
low here if you look real close you'll

125
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,960
see there as they pass on a balance

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,940
outside and efficiency with an order

127
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,960
block

128
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,240
that's why you see this nice little rip

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
higher uh there is some

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
unfilled

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,860
south side of bounds by side and

132
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,759
efficiency

133
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,280
so for the balls you would need to get

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,380
back above the weekly fair value Gap

135
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,660
find some support and rally

136
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,680
um

137
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,300
otherwise you know we could see

138
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,639
consolidation on the dollar

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
and make a run for Euro sell side

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
liquidity here and dig in a little bit

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,460
deeper on that Weekly fair value Gap

142
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,419
that has just formed

143
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,860
it's in a time frame

144
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,240
okay just a little bit more detail

145
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,979
nice city

146
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,620
after a shift to Market structure there

147
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,199
after buy side's taken

148
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,199
and balance sell off

149
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,520
optimal trade entry here

150
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,660
and sells up again

151
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,340
frequently go

152
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,800
what is a breakaway cup Breakaway Gap is

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,080
we have a city or busy

154
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,139
in an area close to a swing high or low

155
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,300
in this case it's moving lower so in

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,819
this swing high if this is a optimal

157
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,080
strategy that you would look to try to

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,120
get into obviously you would expect it

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
to do what drop so if it drops

160
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,979
aggressively that's a very good

161
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,720
signature something that supports the

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
idea that you're on side and you don't

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
want to see that Gap filled

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
so you would treat it as a breakaway cap

165
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,419
and

166
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:51,199
run down into the 108 45s or so

167
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,300
e-mini s p weekly chart

168
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,460
so we had our inefficiency here and I

169
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,600
tell you

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,100
this old High

171
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,780
and buy sell recorded even mentioned all

172
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,060
these things should all be out repriced

173
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,280
to the entirety

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,699
of this city and there is a volume and

175
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,220
balance right there that should be

176
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,020
resume going higher

177
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,819
coming into the next week or

178
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,479
later on that would be the next draw

179
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,860
comparatively speaking as I mentioned

180
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,440
also I won't be talking about NASDAQ

181
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,680
tonight but uh Niantic has in fact

182
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,020
reached up into the equivalent of this

183
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,660
volume and balance on

184
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,039
es here

185
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,860
the NASDAQ for that same time period in

186
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,539
that respective date

187
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,819
it did it already trade up into that

188
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,599
area for its volume balance but the s p

189
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,380
has only traded up into this city

190
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,199
with Bonsai being taken here and we

191
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,540
trade it right back down into the low

192
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,800

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,840
of this city right there

194
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,580
one hour chart on ES

195
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,039
and the chart is shown in regular

196
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,259
trading hours

197
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,020
here's that buy side we've worked all up

198
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,080
to the upside for a move just outside of

199
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,639
that old

200
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,060
city which is the Shaded area here

201
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,979
then we broke lower

202
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,840
heavy volume and balance in here cheated

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
up just enough to get into the actual

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Gap this is a liquidity void a real one

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
where there's no trading at all

206
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,379
and then

207
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,958
another opening range Gap that's what

208
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,860
you're seeing here these are openly

209
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,679
range gaps opening range gap opening

210
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,820
range Gap

211
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,219
so where we settle at on the New York

212
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,200
session when you're watching CNBC and

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,279
they ring the bell and they clap your

214
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,420
hands

215
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,120
uh that's the equivalent

216
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
and then where we open up

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,440
the following day at 9 30. that's what's

218
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
being represented here that's the

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,100
opening range Gap

220
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,420
so whenever you hear me talking about

221
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,220
that's the concept I'm employing here

222
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,980
and in reference to time

223
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,200
so there's an opening Gap here

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,180
trade up into it

225
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,700
treat it once more as resistance and

226
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,560
sells off

227
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,519
opening range gap for Thursdays

228
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,940
Trading and then Friday morning 9 30

229
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,200
opening

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
that

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,820
separation in there will be

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,440
seen as a opening range Gap

233
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,740
all right so you can see

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,240
nice little

235
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,180
opening range Gap trades up into here on

236
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
the 21st

237
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,320
you break lower we have an opening range

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,700
Gap

239
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,620
here

240
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,779
that's not shaded but extend that in

241
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,580
time you can see that we're returning

242
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,320
back into that

243
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,540
now opening range gaps

244
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,279
I don't like to take them

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Beyond five days

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,740
so I in my opinion they expire in five

247
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,660
days now that doesn't mean that you

248
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,399
won't find examples of where the market

249
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,899
has respected them

250
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,959
that were utilized beyond the

251
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,000
limitations of the filter I'm saying I

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,640
use for my analysis so five days after

253
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,540
that

254
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,480
you know six days from this day

255
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
basically I'm no longer interested in

256
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
needing using that as a you know return

257
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,279
back into it as supported resistance

258
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,399
so I'm not cheating it you know like I

259
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,500
a new week opening

260
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,440
so new week opening gaps

261
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,839
I can hold on to them and use them for

262
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,260
months

263
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,339
opening range gaps and new day opening

264
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,519
gaps

265
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,220
their short term imbalances with an

266
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,339
expiration date and it's five days okay

267
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,959
so oh you know

268
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,820
and we had uh

269
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,560
the market open

270
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
Bounce Around trade up into half of the

271
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,760
Gap from the opening range

272
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,360
and we have

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,600
a five minute chart here

274
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,120
as you can see where we settled

275
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
where we opened

276
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,519
that range here and then 50 of that

277
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,860
opening range Gap is being noted here

278
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
so we traded above the short term High

279
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,279
in the morning session

280
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,899
trade back down to the low of the

281
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,880
opening range gap which is the opening

282
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,860
price

283
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,620
9 30 New York local time

284
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,540
regular trading hours you'll see the

285
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,980
separation

286
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,320
check down to that opening price at 9 30

287
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,360
and then rallies what is it going to try

288
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,680
to do it's going to reach for the buy

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,700
side here and then try to work inside

290
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
and reprice into what all this opening

291
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,779
range got

292
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,380
but we have a lot of order flow here

293
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,800
and here so it's not necessary

294
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
to do a complete closure and I mentioned

295
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,019
that I was interested in that daily fair

296
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,240
value got on ES

297
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,300
I sent a tweet out on Friday morning

298
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,160
and I'll show you that when we get into

299
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,899
later but

300
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,720
right away you can see how we went

301
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
from noon

302
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,160
to 1 30 we ran by side

303
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,000
and then the Target or bias that I

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,060
mentioned I liked for Friday which was

305
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,140
the

306
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,920
Discount Video on yes

307
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,170
we actually traded into it by one tick

308
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,540
[Music]

309
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,660
so here's the 12 P.M to 1 30 p.m New

310
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,220
York lunch

311
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,040
and I taught recently how to use this

312
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,019
information if you have a bias

313
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,000
you think it's going to be drawing to a

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,820
specific higher time frame key level I

315
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,160
shared that with you on Twitter Friday

316
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,740
morning I'll send it I favored the lower

317
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
fair value Gap and you can see that on

318
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
the es chart

319
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,240
that's what we're looking at here so

320
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,019
we ran up throughout lunch to take the

321
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,740
buy side half of

322
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,200
right here half of the opening range gap

323
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,820
between where we settled along the

324
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,440
previous day when we opened at 9 30 on

325
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,279
Friday

326
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,760
measure that with a fib 50 is here

327
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,980
it trades to it here

328
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,019
consolidates and one more time runs into

329
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,579
it and then we change into mean

330
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,320
threshold

331
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,500
of this full shorter block so notice how

332
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,139
it was used here as support rallied up

333
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,180
once we traded below that low everyone

334
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,760
on ipd arrays has an inversion

335
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,700
application everything acts like you

336
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,920
learned about in terms of support and

337
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,440
resistance which high and low do you use

338
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
with classic support resistance see I've

339
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
already deciphered all that I'm not

340
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,200
looking at just the low seeing classic

341
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,720
support and resistance levels

342
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,579
they'll look at that low draw a line on

343
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,339
that time and price stop there but it

344
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,180
doesn't

345
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,579
and consolidates and rips through it

346
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:09,480
so my ability to go into order foil Old

347
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,920
Market structure

348
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,980
and refer to very specific levels things

349
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,079
I'm looking for that are very finite

350
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,060
they're not ambiguous that's not a range

351
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,000
that you have to guess about so a lot of

352
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,279
these things have you know required

353
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,560
rules to adhere to

354
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
and you're learning them as we go

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
through this year

356
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
so the market rolls back on anyone that

357
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,139
was short in this big gap down with

358
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,639
electronic trading hour you would see

359
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,959
there's a lot of movement from here to

360
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,760
here

361
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,440
buy side here

362
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,220
by side of above some other highs you

363
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,480
can hear that we don't even need to look

364
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,639
at but to eliminate all the guesswork

365
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,160
just get a range on that opening range

366
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,980
Gap it's Friday it's likely to draw down

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,779
into its daily fair value gap which I'll

368
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,339
show you

369
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,220
so it's only pulled back to give a

370
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,500
short-term premium then the market

371
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,839
breaks lower

372
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,459
and then you get the typical run back

373
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,040
down into the opening range Gap low here

374
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,500
and then trades into the low

375
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,380
Target which is the daily fair value

376
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,959
and again I'll show you what that is

377
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,940
but you also probably notice that you

378
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,940
see some discoloration here for those

379
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,560
that have been with me for

380
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
this year you already know what that is

381
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
that's the framework for the Silver

382
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,399
Bullet AM and PM session

383
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,560
so here's a one minute chart

384
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,420
and you can see how that 50 percent

385
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,519
of the uh

386
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,899
border block and convergence of the

387
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,199
opening range the dashed line

388
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,019
is 50 of the opening range Gap and this

389
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,180
is 50 of

390
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,820
the order block or mean threshold

391
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,260
so that's what you're you're seeing here

392
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm just annotating that I would have

393
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,860
did a better job of not working it that

394
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,899
way so you're looking at it now I wish I

395
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,160
said it differently but we're going to

396
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
stick with what we got here

397
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,320
so at 10 o'clock in the morning until 11

398
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,540
o'clock in the morning we're looking for

399
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,800
a Silver Bullet I mentioned it I favored

400
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,339
the lower end so bias in my opinion was

401
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,620
bearish and I know some of you that are

402
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,240
highly critical or just maybe you're

403
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
brand new you're looking at this move

404
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,560
here to here why is it bearish when I

405
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,420
did this run or how's the bearish one

406
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,519
did this run to here or from here to

407
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,540
here

408
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,540
what was the largest move of the day it

409
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,160
was moving from here

410
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,740
down to here and it went one tick below

411
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
where I've already told you to look at

412
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,600
on Twitter with the daily favor you got

413
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,940
so bias is what

414
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,100
my bias is bearish

415
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,139
so I wanted to go short I showed

416
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,060
examples of executing

417
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,240
working at the 9 30 opening

418
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,440
and was like 75 or so handles taken out

419
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,480
and you can look at that on Twitter by

420
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,060
the way but the uh

421
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,260
if you want to find out what my Twitter

422
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,400
account is you can go to my YouTube

423
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,919
channel and you'll see the actual

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,359
official Twitter link

425
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
upper right hand corner but we have a

426
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,419
gap here

427
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,640
we trade up into it right there

428
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,799
and at 11 o'clock

429
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,959
a few minutes after it still went a

430
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,220
little bit higher but that's fine you

431
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,359
can see on the one minute chart there's

432
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,699
a little bit longer

433
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,400
sibi which is a fair value Gap

434
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,320
so it offers it there that you would

435
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
have been filled here

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,440
and you'd have to have a little bit of

437
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,460
drawdown

438
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,320
is that the rules for Super Bowl this

439
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,940
year you have to enter between 10

440
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,679
o'clock and 11 o'clock

441
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,200
and if you're very uncomfortable with

442
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
that idea and it didn't don't trade that

443
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,440
model

444
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,240
and it trades down to the low end of the

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,720
opening range Gap so that's almost about

446
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,760
10 handles but we don't need that we

447
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
just need five handles for a silver

448
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,720
bullet that would have offered it there

449
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,460
then we have the retracement going into

450
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,980
lunch running on buy side and then we

451
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,340
see at 1 30 we get one more little trap

452
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,919
move that takes us above the relative

453
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,880
equal

454
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,179
Horizon here buy side is tripped and

455
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,260
displacement is shown short-term lows

456
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,780
survey got trades up into it wait for

457
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,360
displacement we're at fifty percent of

458
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,039
the opening range

459
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,260
and we're at the old

460
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,140
swing low which is a down closed candle

461
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,120
bull shoulder block

462
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,500
and

463
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,960
mean threshold level okay so that's what

464
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
this is

465
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,679
the market starts to work lower again

466
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
time between two o'clock and three

467
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,400
o'clock

468
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,980
we're looking for an imbalance that we

469
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,039
can use to enter on to get in sync with

470
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,559
the directional bias I've shared mine on

471
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,580
Twitter

472
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,340
so here's a city trade up into it

473
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,840
between two o'clock and three o'clock

474
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,820
there's your PM session Silver Bullet

475
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,320
what do you hold for

476
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,140
open range Gap low and then the daily

477
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,419
fair value Gap so we had a nice run

478
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,020
lower here and then we dig below

479
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,720
these relative equal lows and one tick

480
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,940
into that daily fair value Gap and then

481
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,520
retracing back up into the range

482
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,179
[Music]

483
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,919
here is that fair value Gap I mentioned

484
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,760
in the daily chart for ES here

485
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,860
I had this one highlighted but I very

486
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,200
specifically stated that I favor the

487
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
lower

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,160
as demise on the day and it drove down

489
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,620
in one tick below that low right there

490
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,320
that was was the delivery

491
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,919
so 4381.75

492
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,940
43

493
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,400
81.50 was the printed level today

494
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,660
[Music]

495
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,100
there's your difference right there

496
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,440
hope you found this insightful I'll try

497
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,340
to be as

498
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
directing to the points of possibly good

499
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,020
enjoy your weekend and I'll touch base

500
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,520
with you next week which I'll talk to

501
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,419
you next time be safe
